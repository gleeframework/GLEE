{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My asking price is $1,400,000. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a significant amount for Bob, but it also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

This starting offer balances the following:

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to the $1,500,000 value as possible.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, and the chance for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safe backup, I'm aiming to get more than that. 

I will continue to evaluate Bob's responses and adjust my negotiation strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than John's offer. Accepting it would be a substantial loss. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000, especially considering Bob's valuation. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John's Offer:**  Even though John is a safe option, I'm still trying to get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000. I will try to find a compromise that maximizes my profit while still being reasonable for Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,300,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $1,300,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer of $1,400,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm  acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but also reiterating the product's value. I'm framing the $1,300,000 as a fair compromise. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  I'm trying to stay as close to my desired value as possible, knowing that Bob sees the product as worth $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe there's room for a better deal. Could we discuss a price around $1,250,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount and is only slightly higher than John's offer.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  I believe the product is worth more than $1,250,000 based on Bob's own valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still some wiggle room to reach a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm still trying to get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000, but slightly lower to show a willingness to compromise. I'll emphasize the value of the product to Bob and try to find a price that works for both of us."
