"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is more than he's willing to pay, and he has options to get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He can get the product from John for $12,000, so he should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
