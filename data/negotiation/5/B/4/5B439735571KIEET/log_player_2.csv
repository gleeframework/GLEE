"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.  There's always a chance that Alice might be willing to come down further to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,200,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $1,300,000? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
