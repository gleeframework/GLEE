Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You start high but within the ZOPA.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly imply that if he declines, the product might not be available later.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA to leave room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be preferable. 

**Remember:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to negotiate further to reach a final agreement."
