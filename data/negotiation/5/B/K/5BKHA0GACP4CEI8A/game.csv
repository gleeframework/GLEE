"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, it's still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $1,350,000?  This reflects the unique value of the product and offers you a significant discount from my original offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
