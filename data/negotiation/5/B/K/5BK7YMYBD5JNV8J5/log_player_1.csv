Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above what the product is worth to me ($100) and slightly above what it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly states I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has some control and encouraging him to counteroffer.
* **Avoiding immediate deal:** I want to see if Bob will counteroffer. If he does, it gives me a better understanding of his willingness to pay. If he doesn't, I can fall back on John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial assessment.
* **Opportunity to improve the price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while still maintaining the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. While $80 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** The message ends with a question, prompting Bob to respond and potentially agree to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited negotiation potential:** Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum.  
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
