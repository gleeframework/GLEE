"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant. I could let it go for $1,300,000.  I believe this price point better reflects its potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value I see in this product and my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
