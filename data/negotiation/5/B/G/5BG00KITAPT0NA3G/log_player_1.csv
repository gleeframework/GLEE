Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""unique value and potential,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have John as a backup offer, giving you a strong position to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below your aspiration and John's guaranteed offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the value,  $1,400,000  doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised price is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** By dropping $300,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but the decrease is still substantial, maintaining a strong position.
* **Reiterating Value:** You continue to subtly emphasize the product's value, hoping to shift Bob's perception closer to your target range.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** This offer aims for a price closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, a common negotiation tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the market value and the benefits, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now higher than John's guaranteed $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Securing a Profit:**  A $1,600,000 sale still represents a significant profit, even if it's not your ideal price."
