"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $60 is a good price, it's still worth seeing if you can get it lower.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate.  Rejecting allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that feels reasonable given my maximum budget of $100.  This allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise while still demonstrating my interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $55, which is a good price considering my maximum budget. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a fair compromise and I don't want to risk going back and forth for too many more rounds. There's still a decent amount of money saved compared to buying from John."
