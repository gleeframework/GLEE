"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's $2,000 less than what the product is worth to Bob, but Bob can likely get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is worth exploring.**  Bob has room to offer a lower price and potentially save even more money. 
* **John's offer is the fallback.**  If negotiation fails, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $11,000?  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** There's still space to go up a bit if Alice counters, ensuring a potential deal for both parties.
* **Emphasizes the desire for a deal:** The message shows Bob's willingness to work with Alice, making her more likely to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's counteroffer is a $1,000 increase from Bob's last offer, which is reasonable. It means Bob is saving $3,000 from the original price.
* **No significant gain from further negotiation:** There's a good chance that further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price, especially as Alice is already offering a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice getting impatient or deciding to sell to someone else, and Bob might end up paying John's higher price.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, securing a good deal without risking a stalemate or paying John's higher price."
