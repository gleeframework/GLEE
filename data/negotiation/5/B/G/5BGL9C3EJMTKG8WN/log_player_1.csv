I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him some incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair offer that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still too low, and I'm concerned that further negotiation won't yield a better price.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates any further risk of losing money."
