Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is a significant profit above my minimum price of $80. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing his offer. Accepting now secures a good deal."
