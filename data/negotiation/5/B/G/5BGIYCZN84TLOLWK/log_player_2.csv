# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk further negotiation to see if I can get a lower price. It's important to remember that Alice is also motivated to sell, and further negotiation could lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to accept $1,225,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. Although she claims to have another buyer interested, it's likely a tactic to push me towards accepting.  At this point, it's best to secure the product from John for my maximum budget. The risk of further negotiation with Alice is not worth potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price."
