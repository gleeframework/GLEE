"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to accept $1,225,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
