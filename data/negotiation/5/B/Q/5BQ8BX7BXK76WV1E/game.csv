"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $775,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $800,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
