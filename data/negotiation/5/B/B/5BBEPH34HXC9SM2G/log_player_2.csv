"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a counter-offer closer to her $8,000 value. You can then negotiate for a better price or proceed with John's offer if necessary."
