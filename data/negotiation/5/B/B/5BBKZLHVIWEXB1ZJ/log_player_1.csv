Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Agreement:** There's a potential win-win between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might make him walk away, while going too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a potential $50,000 gain while securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""time-sensitive"" note encourages a quicker decision.

**Important Considerations**

This is a single-round negotiation. In reality, there might be back-and-forth offers and counter-offers.  You always have John as a backup, which gives you strong leverage."
