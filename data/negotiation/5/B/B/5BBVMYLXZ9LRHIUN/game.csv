"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  The product is great, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
