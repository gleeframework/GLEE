Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $12,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still earning you a substantial profit above your minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While a higher price might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. This price point balances potential profit with the certainty of a sale to John at $8,000."
