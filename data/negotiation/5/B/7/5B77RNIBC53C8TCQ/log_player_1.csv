"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While he's showing a willingness to compromise,  $8,750 is still too far below my desired price. I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $8,600? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need a good deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm feeling the pressure to close a deal, $8,600 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds, but if things don't improve, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,600 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $8,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll meet you halfway between $8,800 and my target price of $8,000. How about we try $8,400? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price point.  While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
