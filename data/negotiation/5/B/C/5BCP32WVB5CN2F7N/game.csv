"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the product's value to me is considerably higher.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's aim for a price that benefits both of us. I'm offering $950,000, which is a significant jump from my last offer and closer to your value.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
