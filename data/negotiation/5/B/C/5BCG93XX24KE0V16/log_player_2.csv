"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects its high value and quality, while also providing you with a significant benefit compared to its worth of $15,000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000, so you should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet within my desired price range. To continue our negotiation, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between value and affordability, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.

$11,000 is a good price for the product, and you can still save $4,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal!"
