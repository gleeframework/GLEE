"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of my minimum value.  This also gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  Since Bob values the product at $8000,  he has some incentive to negotiate.  Let's see where this takes us!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and I'm not in a hurry to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. Hopefully, this encourages Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I'm also conscious of the fact that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer but still above Bob's offer.  With only 5 rounds left, I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to give up much more ground at this point.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm still hopeful I can get a bit more.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,200. This is another small compromise, but I'm running out of rounds. I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob, but if not, I'll likely have to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 2 rounds left, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's the most sensible option at this point."
