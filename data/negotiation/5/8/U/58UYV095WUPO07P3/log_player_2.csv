"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, there are still 7 rounds left.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  While he could buy from John now, there's a chance he could get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,275,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still hesitant to go above $1,250,000, Bob. However, I want to emphasize that our product is a unique opportunity that can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,260,000. This is as close as I can get to your budget while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,260,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While there are still 5 rounds left, Bob doesn't have a lot of room to negotiate further. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum budget, ensuring a definite purchase and avoiding further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or a worse deal."
