"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Significant Difference:** The initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. A counteroffer far below that price sends a strong signal that I'm serious about a lower price point.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While my ideal price is lower, offering $800,000 leaves room for Alice to counter and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down, $2,000,000 is still significantly above both my budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential to reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John as a Backup:** The option to buy from John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net and leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,400,000?  That feels like a fairer deal to me."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'm going to continue the process.
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** My goal is to get the product for a price that's beneficial for both of us.  $1,400,000 is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it's still well below her initial asking price and a reasonable markup from John's offer.
* **Conveying Seriousness:** By suggesting a specific number and framing it as a ""fair deal,"" I'm signaling that I'm serious about purchasing the product but need her to move closer to my price range."
