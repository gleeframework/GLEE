"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,400,000?  That feels like a fairer deal to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
