Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim high but stay realistic.  $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Exclusivity:**  Emphasizing that this is a limited-time offer and that other buyers are interested creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. By offering it slightly below that, you make it very tempting for him to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John's offer, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
