"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825000?  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
