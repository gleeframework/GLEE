"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your operation.  I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. This is a very competitive price considering its potential return on investment for you.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I believe this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a little high.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value it holds for you while still being a fair deal for me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position on the value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
