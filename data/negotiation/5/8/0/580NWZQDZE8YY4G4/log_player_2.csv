"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John for $8,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep yourself in a position to get a better deal."
