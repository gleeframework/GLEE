``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives you a good starting point for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $90. How about $87? That's the closest I can get to $90 without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 90}
