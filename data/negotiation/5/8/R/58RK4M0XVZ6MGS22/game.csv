"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the product and your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
