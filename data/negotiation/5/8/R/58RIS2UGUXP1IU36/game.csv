"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13500. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $12250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $13000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11750, which is my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",11750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11750, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can do $12500. That's as close to your offer as I can get. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
