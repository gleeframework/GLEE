"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I have 8 rounds left with Bob, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also allowing you to make a profit. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher offer. I have 6 rounds remaining with Bob, and I'm confident we can reach a better compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. This would ensure both of us walk away happy with a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $975,000.  I feel this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Do we have an agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a higher price. I have 4 rounds left with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 unless it becomes absolutely necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However,  $975,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
