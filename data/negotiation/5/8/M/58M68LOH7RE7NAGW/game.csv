,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also allowing you to make a profit. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, wouldn't you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. This would ensure both of us walk away happy with a fair deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $975,000.  I feel this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Do we have an agreement?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However,  $975,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
