Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000. However, I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much. Offering $12,000 is a good compromise that gives Bob a reasonable price and still gives me a decent profit. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
