"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. Considering the product's value and the efforts I've put into it, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $795,000. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
