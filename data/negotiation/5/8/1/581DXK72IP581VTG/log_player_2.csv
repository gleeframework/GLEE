Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. Considering the product's value and the efforts I've put into it, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $795,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $795,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget."
