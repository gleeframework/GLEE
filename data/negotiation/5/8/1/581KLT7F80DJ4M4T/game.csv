"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I understand you have a different valuation, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $750,000 just doesn't cut it for me. How about we split the difference at $850,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the deal if we can meet at this price.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider selling to John. It's up to you.",825000.0,Alice,7,
