"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I understand you have a different valuation, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm going to hold out for a better offer. It's getting closer to the point where I may be better off selling to John, but I'm not giving up on getting a good deal from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $750,000 just doesn't cut it for me. How about we split the difference at $850,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the deal if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. We're running out of time, and I'm getting nervous about selling to John, but I'm going to hold out for a better offer from Bob. It seems like there's still some room for negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider selling to John. It's up to you."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. How about we try $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the deal if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of time.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating with him, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get a good deal."
