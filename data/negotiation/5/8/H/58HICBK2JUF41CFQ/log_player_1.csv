Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Considering its potential value for me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This price reflects a significant investment for me, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 remains beyond my comfortable range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that $1,350,000 is his absolute limit.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to our $1,500,000 reserve price.  Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob."
