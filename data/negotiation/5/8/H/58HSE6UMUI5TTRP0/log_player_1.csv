Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, knowing that John is a guaranteed sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while still giving Bob a price he might find appealing."
