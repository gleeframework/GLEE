"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a little less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still make more money by continuing to negotiate.  $120 is close to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $130. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $125. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his offer.  I'm hoping that this will be an acceptable compromise for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is not bad, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm also aware that we are nearing the end of our negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering a price of $120, which is exactly the middle ground between my last offer and Bob's offer. It's a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it.  With only three rounds left, I need to secure a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $110. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to John for $100, and there's no guarantee that Bob will accept a higher offer in the next round."
