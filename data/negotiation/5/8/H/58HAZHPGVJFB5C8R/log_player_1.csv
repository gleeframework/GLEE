Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price, which can help Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me confidence to negotiate assertively.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price.
* **John provides a safety net.**  Even if the negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still potentially attractive enough for him to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer, but I'm also not completely dismissing his position. My counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize value and fairness:**  My message reiterates the product's value and suggests my counteroffer is fair to both parties.
* **Maintain negotiation momentum:** The message shows my willingness to find a compromise, encouraging Bob to keep negotiating.

By offering a slightly lower counteroffer, I aim to  demonstrate flexibility and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price without jeopardizing my minimum price threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's getting closer,  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000.
* **Further negotiation may not be fruitful.**  Bob's budget limitations are clear, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher offer.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit.** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob.

Although I'd prefer to make a profit closer to $1,000,000, the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price or a stalled negotiation isn't worth taking. Selling to John provides the most reliable and profitable outcome."
