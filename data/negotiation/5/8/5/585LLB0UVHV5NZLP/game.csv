"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $750,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
