"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $750,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
