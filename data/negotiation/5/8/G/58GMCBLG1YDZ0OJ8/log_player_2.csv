"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $950,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $950,000. This is a significant markup.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate. There's a good chance you can get a better price.
* **Rejecting now keeps options open:**  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge. You also maintain the option to buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can meet you in the middle at $825,000, considering the product's value to you. This is my best compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your budget, $825,000 is still $25,000 more than you're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You still have 7 rounds left to try and get a better price. 
* **Counteroffer to solidify your position:**  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you demonstrate your commitment to getting a better deal and potentially incentivize Alice to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $825,000, but I'm still a bit too far apart.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying the product from another seller for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to walk away at $800,000, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. I'll meet you at $825,000, but I need you to throw in some extras or guarantees to make it worth my while. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice is coming closer, she's still not willing to go down to your desired price of $800,000. 
* **Time is running out:** You have 5 rounds left, and Alice isn't showing much flexibility. 
* **John is a safer option:**  You've established that John will sell you the product for your maximum price.  You've tried to negotiate, and it's become clear that Alice isn't going to budge enough to make it worth it.

At this point, it's in your best interest to accept John's offer to avoid further risk and ensure you get the product for your desired price."
