"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $95?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. How about $102? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
