Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not overly aggressive and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This information asymmetry works in your favor.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** A higher asking price carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
