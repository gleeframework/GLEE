"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price seems a bit high for me. Could you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This reflects a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
