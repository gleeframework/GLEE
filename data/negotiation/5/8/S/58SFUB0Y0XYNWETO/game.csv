"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $800,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the market value of the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $975,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to meet my budget and you to get a good return on your investment.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $975,000. I'll offer you a slight adjustment, bringing the price down to $990,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
