"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us - you get a great price and I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm proposing $950,000. This price still allows me a good return on my investment, and it's a great deal for you, given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle on this!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the value I'll get from it. Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,
