"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, which is still a fantastic deal considering the value to you. Let's find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
