"Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to take another step closer to your offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,,
