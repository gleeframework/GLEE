"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $1200000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, I'm aiming to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a significant discount from the original asking price.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $925000 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about we settle on $875000? This would allow us both to save some money and come to an agreeable agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save even more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'll counteroffer at $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
