"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $14,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I understand the product's value, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $11,200? That's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to close the deal.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,400, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to reach an agreement in this round!",11400.0,Alice,7,
