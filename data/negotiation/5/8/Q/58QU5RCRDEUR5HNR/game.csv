"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $20000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $20000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go slightly higher, so I'll counteroffer at $22000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $19500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $19500. I'll meet you halfway between $19500 and $22000, so I'll counteroffer at $20750. What do you think?",20750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $20750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $19000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",19000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $19000. I'll meet you halfway between $19000 and $22000 again, but this time I'll add a small premium for the effort we've put into this negotiation. I'll counteroffer at $21000. What do you think?",21000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really not willing to go above $19000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. Can you meet me at $19000?",19000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal yet. I'll make one final offer: I'll meet you at $19000, but I need to add a small concession to make it worth my while. I'll throw in a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, I'll sell the product to you for $19000, plus the service, making the total value $20000. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added service, but I'm still not willing to pay $19000. I'm willing to meet you at $18500 for the product, and I'll take the service as a nice bonus. Can you meet me at this price?",18500.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're really close, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $18500. I'll consider it, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'll counteroffer at $18750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18500 and $19000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",18750.0,Alice,11,
,,Bob,11,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting too close to the price I was willing to pay for the product from John. I'm willing to meet you at $18000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",18000.0,Bob,12,
,,Alice,12,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'll make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $18250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. What do you think?",18250.0,Alice,13,
,,Bob,13,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm still not willing to pay $18250. I'm willing to meet you at $17500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",17500.0,Bob,14,
,,Alice,14,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of no return, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $17500. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $18000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,15,
,,Bob,15,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really not willing to go above $17000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to walk away and buy from John for $15000.",17000.0,Bob,16,
,,Alice,16,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell the product to John for $15000, Bob. I think it's worth more than that. I'll meet you at $17000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll throw in the complimentary service I offered earlier, worth $1000, to sweeten the deal. So, I'll sell the product to you for $17000, plus the service, making the total value $18000.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really not willing to pay $17000. I'll meet you at $16500, and I'll take the service as a nice bonus. That's as low as I can go.",16500.0,Bob,18,
