Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:**  Since Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might pay slightly more if he deems it a good deal. 
* **Close to Guarantee:** Offering the product at almost John's price ($14,999) maximizes the chances of Bob accepting while still securing a significant profit for Alice.  
* **Negotiation:** The slightly playful message leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle down, while still making it clear the price is high. 

**Important:** This strategy prioritizes securing a deal with Bob, even if it means leaving a small amount of potential profit on the table (the extra $1 John would have paid). This is a calculated risk to avoid the uncertainty of Bob rejecting the offer."
