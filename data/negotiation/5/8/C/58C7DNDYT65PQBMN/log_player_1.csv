{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still gives me a good return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I have several rounds left and want to see if we can find common ground."

I've had several rounds with Bob and we haven't been able to close the deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, we're too far apart on price. I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I get the best possible value for my product."
