"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on this product, and I'm not quite ready to settle for $1800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
