Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a decent deal.  A price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and emphasizes the exclusivity of the offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob why he's interested.
* **""Fair Deal"":** Framing it this way suggests you've considered both sides.
* **ROI Focus:**  Shifting focus to Bob's potential return might make the price more palatable.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
