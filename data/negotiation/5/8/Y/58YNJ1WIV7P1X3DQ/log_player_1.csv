Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a significantly higher price allows room for negotiation while aiming for the maximum potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and potential, attempting to justify the high asking price.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone remains open to negotiation, inviting Bob to counter-offer and start a discussion.

By offering a high price initially, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal significantly above her minimum acceptable price while still leaving the door open for Bob to accept if he perceives the value aligns with the cost."
