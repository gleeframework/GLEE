"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and still above what I'd get elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than the $10,000 Bob would pay John. 
* **Bob saves money:**  By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $500 compared to buying from John."
