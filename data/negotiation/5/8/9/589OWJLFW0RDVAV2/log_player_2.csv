"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than yours. There's plenty of room for negotiation. You should make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product has a lower value to me, so I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Signals Serious Interest:** It shows Alice you're serious about buying but not at her initial price.
* **Establishes a Lower Anchor:** By starting significantly lower, you aim to pull the negotiation closer to your desired range.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** It allows you to incrementally increase your offer during subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, my price reflects the true worth of this product.  I could consider coming down to $950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down significantly, her ""final offer"" is still above your maximum budget and John's price.  There's a chance she might be bluffing about it being her final offer, or she might be willing to negotiate a bit more. It's worth making one more counteroffer closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $700,000.  That's a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledge Alice's Movement:**  You start by showing her you recognize she's made a concession, which helps maintain goodwill.
* **Firm but Fair:** You present your offer as ""firm"" to signal you're reaching your limit but also frame it as a ""fair compromise.""
* **Strategic Positioning:** $700,000  is closer to your $800,000 walk-away point but still leaves room for a potential (though unlikely) counteroffer from Alice. 

If Alice rejects this offer, you'll be in a strong position to walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
