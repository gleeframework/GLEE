"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $1,400,000 falls quite short of what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer and while it's closer to my budget, I still feel that the product's value justifies a lower price for me. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,550,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise given the value I perceive in the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
