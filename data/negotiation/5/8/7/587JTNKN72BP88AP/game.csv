"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? I believe that's a fair price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $850,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $950,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to my price, I can only go down to $925,000. This represents a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're not interested at this price, I'm willing to move on to other potential buyers.",925000.0,Alice,5,
