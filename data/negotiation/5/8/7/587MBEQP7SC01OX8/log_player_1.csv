Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $125 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves room for him to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we're secure knowing John will buy it for our minimum acceptable price."
