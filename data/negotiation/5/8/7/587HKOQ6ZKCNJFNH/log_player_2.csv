"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $14,000 is below Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can potentially get a better deal.  

There's no immediate need to buy from John, as Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price of $13,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $14,000, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. This price is still within Bob's budget, and is closer to Alice's likely minimum selling price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, $14,500 is still too high. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  There's still room to push for a lower price.  Bob should continue negotiating rather than accepting this offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price of $13,500. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. This price is still within Bob's budget and is closer to Alice's likely minimum selling price. The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a little, $14,750 is still above Bob's desired price point. Bob should reject this offer and continue to push for a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob's negotiation strategy has already yielded some success. It's possible that Alice will be more willing to compromise in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price of $13,750. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This price is still within Bob's budget and is closer to Alice's likely minimum selling price. The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both parties, and this offer represents a good middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,800 is still higher than what Bob is comfortable paying.  While time is running out, Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has a clear strategy.  There are still a few rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might come down further.  Additionally, buying from John for $15,000 is only slightly more expensive than Alice's current offer. Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
