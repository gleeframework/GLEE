"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $85, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob.  I'm going to accept his offer."
