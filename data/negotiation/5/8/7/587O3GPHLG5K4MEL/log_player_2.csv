"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. $125 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's still higher than Alice's value for the product ($100), making it potentially acceptable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal considering the alternative is to buy from John for $150.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $20 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob being forced to buy from John at a higher price is not worth the potential savings."
