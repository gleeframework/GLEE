Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value of $150 but still above my minimum of $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below his perceived value, and it's closer to my desired price. I hope Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
