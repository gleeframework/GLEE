Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. While I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, Bob's perceived value is higher.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($11,500) leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below $10,000 knowing I have another buyer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price point is a strong starting point that benefits both of us. Bob gets a perceived ""deal"" from his $12,000 valuation, and I maximize my potential profit."
