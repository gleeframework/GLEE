Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, my goal is to maximize profit. Bob is willing to pay a significant amount, potentially more than my fallback option.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be favorable for me.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and my confidence in it helps justify the high price. 

**Important Note:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, I'm prepared to adjust my price strategically, keeping in mind my $1,000,000 minimum and aiming for the highest possible profit."
