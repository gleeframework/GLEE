"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item valued at $150 by you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, you're aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by establishing a lower price point.  It's a reasonable starting point considering your goal is to save money.  This offer also gives you room to negotiate further if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm glad we're working towards a mutual agreement. I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $135 for the product. This is my best offer considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target price but still a bit high.  You're aiming to save as much as possible, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation moving and opens the door for a lower counteroffer from you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $130. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  It's a reasonable offer that's not too far from Alice's last offer, but still closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your proposal. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to offer it at $128. This is my final offer before I consider selling it to another buyer. Please let me know if this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $128 is very close to your desired price point, and you're already in round 5, meaning time is running out. Accepting this offer is a good balance between saving money and getting the product. It's likely that continuing to negotiate won't result in a significantly lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether or having to pay John's higher price."
