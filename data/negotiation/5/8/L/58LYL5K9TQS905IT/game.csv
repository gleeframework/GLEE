"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $900,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $825,000? It's a compromise that I think is reasonable and still reflects the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
