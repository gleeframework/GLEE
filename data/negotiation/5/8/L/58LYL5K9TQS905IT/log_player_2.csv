"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $900,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $825,000? It's a compromise that I think is reasonable and still reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price down further.  It's risky to accept the offer and potentially regret it later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
