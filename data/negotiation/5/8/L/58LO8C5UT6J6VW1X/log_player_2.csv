Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm thinking of $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up to $10,000, but I'm still not convinced that's a good enough price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $11,250. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is the highest you're willing to go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet in the middle. I'll come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has repeatedly shown she won't go below $11,000. It's unlikely she'll change her mind in the last round.  While buying from John is more expensive ($15,000), it's better than potentially getting stuck with no deal and having to settle for Alice's $11,000 price at the last minute."
