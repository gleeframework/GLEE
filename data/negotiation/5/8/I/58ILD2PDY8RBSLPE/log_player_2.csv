"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm willing to pay $150, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away. There's a chance I can get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $120 is still a decent price for me, and I'm hoping this initial offer will signal my seriousness in getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is a reasonable price for me. I don't want to risk her getting stubborn and going back up to $150, or me running out of rounds before I can make a deal. It's a good compromise."
