"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. My asking price is $17,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make him more likely to engage.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to discuss the price, which will keep Bob engaged.

**Important Note:**  I am choosing to start the negotiation with Bob because he is the only one who has expressed interest so far. However, I will be keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $12,000? I'm genuinely interested in the product, but that's my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest and willingness to negotiate. There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to make him see the value in my counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication open and friendly to encourage further negotiation.

**Important note:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I want to see if we can close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase quickly.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation room:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price if we continue.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I don't want to settle for less than I believe the product is worth. Continuing the negotiation might lead to a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob, but I'm aware that John is a reliable fallback option if things don't work out.

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming to reach a price closer to $14,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $13,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This would be a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Emphasis on finality:**  I'm reminding Bob that this could be the last chance to finalize the deal quickly, putting pressure on him to accept.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and respectful to encourage a positive outcome.

**Important note:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal now.  If we can't agree on this, I'm ready to move forward with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Bob's budget is firmly fixed at $13,000, and I'm unwilling to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting more time and potentially reaching a point where he actually walks away, leaving me with nothing. 
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John is the most logical choice given the current situation. It minimizes risk and ensures a satisfactory outcome."
