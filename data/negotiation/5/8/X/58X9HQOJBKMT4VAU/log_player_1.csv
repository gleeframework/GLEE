Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $110 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80). While he may try to negotiate, there's a chance he'll see the value in the product for his own reasons and accept. 
* **Alternative Secured:** You have the security of John's offer, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
