Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob at $1,150,000 still yields a significant profit over Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:** Starting slightly below John's offer creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as exclusive and time-sensitive encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on a deal he perceives as valuable."
