"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,200,000 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  How about $1,300,000? That still gives you a great value, and it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? That's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a price that's more beneficial for me. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $1,275,000? It's a small compromise from my previous offer and still offers a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1250000. How about we try to find a sweet spot at $1225000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take $1,225,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. I have four rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference and go with $1,237,500? It's a small step up from your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1237500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, which would be $1225000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. We're in round 8, and Bob has not moved significantly from his previous offer. It's becoming clear that he's unlikely to meet my minimum price.  While selling to John means a lower profit, it guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a worse outcome."
