"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value, I believe it's worth $100 for you. Would you like to proceed? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's value of the product. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a good deal.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $90 is less than Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **There's still room for saving:** While Bob ideally wants to pay $85, accepting this offer saves $30 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice either rejecting further offers or becoming unwilling to sell.  

Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price with less risk of losing out on the deal."
