"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to accept this offer before exploring other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up with something more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counter-offering at $100.  This is still above Bob's initial offer but shows a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum, it's still not profitable enough for me. I'm going to reject his offer again and continue negotiating. I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob, but I'm aware that I could always sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $95.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above Bob's perceived value and is closer to my minimum desired price. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to make a reasonable offer."
