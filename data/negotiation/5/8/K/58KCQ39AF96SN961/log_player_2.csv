We are confident this investment will provide significant returns for you. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this special offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's initial offer is at that price, there's no immediate advantage to accepting. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer. This allows him to potentially save money."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but I'm looking to invest a bit less than that. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This aligns with my budget and allows room for a profitable return. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
