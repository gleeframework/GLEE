"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always best to try to negotiate and get a better price.  Since Alice's initial offer is your maximum price, there's room to potentially negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer opens up the opportunity to counter and save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  It's a bold move, but it shows you're serious about getting a good deal.  This price gives Alice room to counter while still allowing you to potentially save a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer. Accepting the offer at $1,300,000 saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, there's a risk of Alice walking away or you running out of rounds before getting a better deal. It's a good balance of risk and reward."
