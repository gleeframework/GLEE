"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to start the conversation.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm framing the price as fair to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not offering the full $1,500,000 to give Bob room to counter-offer and create a sense of win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a higher price.
* **Goal is to Maximize Profit:** I want to maximize my profit, and accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss. 

I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $1,150,000 to make this work. Let's keep talking, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $1,250,000 to $1,150,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** I'm not conceding to Bob's initial offer, indicating I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Positive & Collaborative Tone:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that finding a price that works for both of us is the goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time.  How about $1,100,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need.
* **More Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards, especially with only six rounds remaining.
* **Time is a Factor:** As we get closer to the end of the negotiation, the risk of failing to reach a deal increases.  However, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a good price, and me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a smaller concession of $25,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my bargaining position.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I emphasize the compromise aspect and how this price benefits both of us.
* **Clear and Concise:**  I'm keeping my message concise and focused on the price, avoiding unnecessary distractions.
* **Pressure to Close:**  I'm highlighting the need for a decision to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to finalize this agreement. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left. The risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob increases significantly.
* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is a guaranteed buyer who will pay my full asking price. 

I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to accept John's offer and guarantee my desired profit. While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, the time constraints and the likelihood of a favorable outcome are low."
