"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $1,150,000 to make this work. Let's keep talking, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time.  How about $1,100,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a good price, and me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to finalize this agreement. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
