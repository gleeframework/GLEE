"I appreciate you offering the product, but $150 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is still a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
