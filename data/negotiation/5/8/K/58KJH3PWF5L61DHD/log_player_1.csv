Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
