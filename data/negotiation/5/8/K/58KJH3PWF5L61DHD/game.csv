"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your interest in the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, and I'll offer the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $780,000.  Would you be willing to meet me around there?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'll offer the product for $812,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",812500.0,Alice,7,
