"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to profit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to make a profit.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 6-month warranty and a free maintenance package. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
