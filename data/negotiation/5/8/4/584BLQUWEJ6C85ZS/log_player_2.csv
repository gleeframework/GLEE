"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to profit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can push for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 6-month warranty and a free maintenance package. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer, even with the extras, is still above my budget.  I've already made several counteroffers and I'm not convinced she's willing to come down further.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of going over my budget is too high. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees I stay within my limit and ensures a successful purchase."
