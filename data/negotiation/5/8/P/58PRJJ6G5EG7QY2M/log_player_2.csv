"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given your expertise in [Mention Bob's expertise or area of interest], this product could be a game changer.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering the potential benefits this product offers.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is motivated to sell high:**  Alice wants to get as much as possible for the product, which is worth less to her ($1,000,000) than your maximum price ($1,200,000).
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between Alice's offer ($1,150,000) and what you're willing to pay from John ($1,200,000). By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that she needs to come down in price. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you might:

* **Force a better offer from Alice:** She might be willing to lower the price rather than lose the sale. 
* **Stick with John if necessary:** If Alice doesn't budge significantly, you still have the option of buying from John at your maximum price."
