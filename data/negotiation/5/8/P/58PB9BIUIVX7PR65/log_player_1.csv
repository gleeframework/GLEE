Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident in securing a better price. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,125,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's initial offer.  I believe this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider while allowing me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal.  I've already rejected his counteroffer and have been pushing for a higher price. At this point, I'm starting to feel like further negotiations won't get me a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I meet my minimum requirement, and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
