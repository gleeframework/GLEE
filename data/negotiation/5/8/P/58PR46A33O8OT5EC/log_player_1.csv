Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Aim High, Room to Negotiate:** Starting at $150 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to go lower or stick to a price closer to your minimum. 
* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While Bob only values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay more than that if he perceives it as a good deal or a necessity. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives you leverage. You don't *need* to sell to Bob for less than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this initial offer. You might need to adjust your approach based on his response."
