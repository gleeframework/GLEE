"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $10,250. This is a good compromise considering the value it holds for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
