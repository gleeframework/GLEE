"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I think the product is a great opportunity, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,250. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $9,750? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,8,
