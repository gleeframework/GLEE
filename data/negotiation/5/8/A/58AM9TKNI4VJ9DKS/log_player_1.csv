"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This seems like a fair price considering its value and your potential profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $9,000 is a little too low for me, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him.  I still have 9 rounds left, so I have time to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows you to save a significant amount compared to its true value to you, and it's fair for me considering my costs.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That allows me to get closer to my budget while still giving you a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,750. While it's not the ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm hoping for, and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept a fair price now than risk getting a lower price later or having to sell to John for only $8,000."
