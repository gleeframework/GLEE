""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount compared to its true worth to you. What do you think?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This is crucial information in maximizing your profit.
* **Setting a High Target:** Aiming for a price close to his valuation ($925,000) gives you the best chance of securing a high profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John, providing a strong safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
