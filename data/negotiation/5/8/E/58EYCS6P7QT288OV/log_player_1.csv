Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $130 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get more, $120 is my minimum value and I'm satisfied with that outcome. It's better to close the deal now and avoid potentially losing out on the sale if the negotiations continue."
