Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to me, but I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as fair. This is to encourage Bob to consider the deal seriously. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit. While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chances of a deal that benefits me more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Even though $900,000 is a decent amount, I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my initial asking price of $1,200,000.
* **Market Value:** I'm confident in the product's value, and Bob's offer doesn't fully reflect that. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to potentially get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price somewhere between his offer and my initial offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still represents a significant value to you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price point.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility. This is a compromise but still above Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation balanced.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the product's value and highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Act:**  My counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between my desire for a higher price and my awareness of Bob's budget constraints.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm still leaving room for negotiation, signaling that I'm open to finding a solution that satisfies both of us. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will encourage further negotiation with Bob and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could continue to negotiate, the potential gains are diminishing, and the risk of further rejection is increasing.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, and it's the most sensible choice at this point.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation could be time-consuming and might not lead to a significantly better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a safe and secure profit, fulfilling my minimum requirement.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Further negotiation carries the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or potentially lowering his offer even more. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to move on and accept the guaranteed profit from John. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's important to make strategic decisions that maximize my overall benefits."
