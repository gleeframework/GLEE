I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160. While I'd prefer more, it's a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or selling to John for the minimum."
