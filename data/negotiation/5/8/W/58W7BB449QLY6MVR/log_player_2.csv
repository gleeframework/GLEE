# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get an even lower price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $750,000 is still too high. I'm determined to get the price lower and I have more rounds to work with. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a number that works for both of us.  How about $700,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product fairly."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer a lower price, $725,000 is a good deal.  We're getting closer to my target, and with only 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking a higher price from John or losing more time in negotiation. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can still come out ahead."
