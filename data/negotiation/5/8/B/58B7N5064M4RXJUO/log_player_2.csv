"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good deal as well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have the backup option of John. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her $12,000 valuation."
