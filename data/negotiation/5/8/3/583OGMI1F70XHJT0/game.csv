"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the potential value, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's start with $600,000.  This reflects the significant gap between our valuations and leaves room for further discussion.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $700,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $650,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $675,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $675,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping to get to $650,000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $662,500?  This would allow us both to save some money and get this deal done.",662500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $662,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $680,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",680000.0,Alice,7,
