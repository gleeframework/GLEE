"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. How about $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think $108 is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close. $108 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
