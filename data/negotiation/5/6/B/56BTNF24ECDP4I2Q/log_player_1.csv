Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $925,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter, giving you room to decrease the price slightly while still remaining above John's offer.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps justify the high price tag. 

By starting at $925,000, there's a good chance of:

* **Bob Accepting:** The price is significantly lower than his perceived value.
* **Negotiating a Favorable Price:** Even if Bob counters, Alice has room to negotiate and still secure a price well above her minimum."
