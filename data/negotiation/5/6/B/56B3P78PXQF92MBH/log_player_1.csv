Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,200,000.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,600,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it, let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob, I start with a price significantly higher than his perceived value.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential worth to Bob aims to justify the high price, even if it's a negotiation tactic.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that this is a ""unique opportunity"" aims to create a slight sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows me to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob."
