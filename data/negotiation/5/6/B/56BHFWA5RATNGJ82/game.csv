"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I won't be able to sell the product to you for $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900,000? It's a significant step closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but no lower. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
