Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (though unlikely given his perceived value is $100). 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $149 feels significantly cheaper than $150, potentially making Bob more inclined to purchase.

It's unlikely Bob will accept, but this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still ensuring you sell the product."
