"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $110 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to get the product for a price significantly lower than John's $120 offer. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Alice moved closer to my desired price range, but $92.50 is still too high. There's room for further negotiation. 
* **Leverage:** I still have time and the option of John's offer, giving me leverage to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $90 even? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase, Clear Goal:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by slightly increasing my offer.  By proposing a round number like $90, I'm signaling a clear desired price point. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm still below Alice's original offer and well below John's price, maintaining pressure for Alice to move closer to my range."
