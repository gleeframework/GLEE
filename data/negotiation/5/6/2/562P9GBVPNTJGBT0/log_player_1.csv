Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000.
