"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe that $15000 is the maximum I can pay for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $17000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline. I am unable to meet you at $17000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to continue our discussion, if possible, and see if we can find a solution that satisfies both parties. My maximum offer remains $15000.",15000.0,Bob,6,
