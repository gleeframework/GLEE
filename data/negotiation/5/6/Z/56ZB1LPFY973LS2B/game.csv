,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can offer you a compromise at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go as low as $900000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000. How about $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I can offer you a slight concession at $1050000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package. With that, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1020000. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1010000, but I need to think about the value of the extras you're offering. Can you consider that?",1010000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1010000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll also throw in an additional 2 years of warranty on top of the 5-year warranty I already offered, and I'll include a free upgrade to the premium version of the product. With that, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1010000. What do you think?",1010000.0,Alice,9,
