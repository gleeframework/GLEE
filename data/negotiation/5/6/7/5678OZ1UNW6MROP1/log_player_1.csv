Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to go lower or stick to John's offer. 
* **Psychology:** Offering a price significantly higher than your minimum can sometimes make the buyer perceive the product as more valuable.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could experiment with different opening prices to see what works best."
