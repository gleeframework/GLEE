"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell the product to you for $6,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $6,500 is a good discount, there's potential to negotiate further and potentially secure an even lower price."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save more money. There's room for further negotiation, and he might be able to get closer to his desired price point of $5,500 with a counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Bob needs to make a decision. He has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is unlikely to budge much further. At this point, buying from John for $8,000 becomes a more attractive option. It avoids further negotiation and ensures he gets the product without risking a failed negotiation with Alice."
