# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product, and $7,500 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $7,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $9,500. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

At this point, Alice's price is still too high for me.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  To avoid further negotiation, I'll purchase the product from John."
