"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $70. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's opening offer is lower than her valuation, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product looks great, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider $50?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains friendly and expresses interest in the product, encouraging further discussion.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By offering $50, I signal that I'm willing to move upward, but Alice will likely need to come down in price as well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $50. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $65. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice came down in price, which shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:**  While $65 is better, it's still above the midpoint between our last offers ($57.50).  I think I can get it lower.
* **Time Cushion:**  It's still early in the negotiation, and I have time for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $58? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 58
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to the midpoint ($57.50), but not quite meeting it. This shows willingness to compromise but also holds firm on getting a good deal.
* **Justifying the Offer:**  By framing $58 as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm subtly nudging Alice to see it as a reasonable solution.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The language remains friendly and collaborative to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $58. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer it to you for $68. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactic:**  Alice's price decrease is very small, suggesting she might be trying to get me to settle out of impatience.
* **Alternative is Safe:** I'm still not that far off from John's price of $80. If I can't get a significantly better price from Alice soon, I'll go with John. 
* **Keeping the Door Open:** By rejecting but not giving a counteroffer yet, I signal that I'm still interested but need to see more movement from her side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm a bit disappointed. We both know this product is valuable, but your offer isn't moving much. I'm willing to pay $60, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a clear boundary with the ""$60, my absolute limit"" statement. This communicates seriousness and a willingness to walk away. 
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that I have John as a backup plan.
* **Last Chance Offer:**  While the tone is slightly more assertive, it still leaves room for Alice to make one final move and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'll meet you halfway between our last offers and offer it to you for $65. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has labeled this as her ""final counteroffer.""  While she might be bluffing, there's a real risk she won't budge further.
* **Minimal Gain vs. Risk:**  Negotiating further for a few dollars difference isn't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to pay $80 to John. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $65 is a decent compromise. It's below her initial offer and saves me money compared to John."
