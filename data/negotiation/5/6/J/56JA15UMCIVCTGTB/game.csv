"I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I appreciate your dedication to finding a deal. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to explore other options. I'll make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'll lower the price to $1,075,000 was too high, I'll lower it to $1,062,500. This is my last serious offer, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",1062500.0,Alice,9,
