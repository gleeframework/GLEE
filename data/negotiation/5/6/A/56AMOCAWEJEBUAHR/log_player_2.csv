"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very special product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's slightly above my minimum, but still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1050000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
