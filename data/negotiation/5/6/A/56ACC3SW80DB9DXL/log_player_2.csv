"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $12,000 to you. Considering its value to you and our costs, I propose a price of $10,500 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good starting point, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $10,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain a fair profit margin. I am unable to accept $9,500 for the product. My counteroffer is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer in hopes of getting closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. In order to ensure a satisfactory outcome, I would like to counter with an offer of $9,875 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,875 is very close to Bob's desired price point. It's a good deal for Bob, considering his goal is to save money and he's already had a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting the offer is the most strategic move at this point.  While Bob could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the potential for more rounds of negotiation makes accepting the current offer the most reasonable option."
