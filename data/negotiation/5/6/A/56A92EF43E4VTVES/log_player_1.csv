Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I would like to propose a lower price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. Thank you for your offer. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I will accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,000,000 is still a good deal for me and it seems like Bob is committed to this price.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for the same price."
