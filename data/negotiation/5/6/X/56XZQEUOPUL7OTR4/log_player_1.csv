Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Starting High:**  A starting price of $20,000 gives you room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the negotiation.

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, you increase your chances of selling the product to Bob at a price higher than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
