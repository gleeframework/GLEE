I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but it allows for room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $9,500.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a profit.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering Bob's previous offers. It's also significantly better than selling to John.  It's important to find a balance between maximizing profits and securing a sale."
