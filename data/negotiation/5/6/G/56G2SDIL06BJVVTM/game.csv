"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  It's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating with you, but I'm not willing to go below $1,035,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value.  I'm running out of time, so please consider this carefully.",1035000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,035,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer $1,012,500. I believe that's a fair price for the product and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable addition to your business. Let me know your decision.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're running out of time, but I'm not willing to pay $1,020,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer $1,005,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1005000.0,Bob,8,
