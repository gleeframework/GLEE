"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise. It's also below my minimum acceptable value, so I still have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I have more rounds and can try to negotiate a higher price. Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but I want to see if I can get closer to that value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above Bob's perceived value, but closer to his offer, which might make him more likely to accept.  I'm also hoping to get closer to my desired value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I have more rounds and can try to negotiate a higher price. Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but I want to see if I can get closer to that value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering $10,000. This is another compromise, closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will convince him to accept, as it's getting closer to my minimum value.  I'm also conscious of the limited rounds remaining and want to avoid losing out on a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to try and get a better price. While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, I'm hopeful I can get closer to that value with Bob.  The remaining rounds are getting limited, though, so I'll need to be more aggressive in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering $9,800.  This is a more aggressive counteroffer, recognizing that time is running out. It's very close to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept and avoid needing to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob consistently offering prices below my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly more than what Bob is willing to offer, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing at all."
