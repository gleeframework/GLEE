"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  Let's split the difference,  I'll offer $712,500. It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize the deal.",712500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $712,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $720,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation we've had so far.",720000.0,Alice,5,
