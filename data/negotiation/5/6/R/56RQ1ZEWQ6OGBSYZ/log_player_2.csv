"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is close to my limit, but there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a price closer to Alice's value ($120).
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message is framed positively, expressing interest in the product while clearly stating my budget constraints. 
* **Strategic Aim:**  My ideal outcome is to secure the product somewhere between $110 and $120, saving a good amount compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $125, but I'm not going any lower than that. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a fair price and falls within my budget. It allows me to save $25 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's Limit:** Alice's message suggests she's unlikely to go lower than $125. Continuing to negotiate might risk the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Further haggling might not yield significant savings and could prolong the process. Accepting now ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
