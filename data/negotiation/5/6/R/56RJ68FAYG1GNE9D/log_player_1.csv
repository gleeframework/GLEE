"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get a better price from John.  However, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000.  This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price, but if he doesn't budge, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough. It's important for me to get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob,  I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
