Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $98. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
