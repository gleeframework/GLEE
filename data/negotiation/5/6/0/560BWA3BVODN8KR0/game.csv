"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $825000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $825000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $775000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $812500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $785000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $800000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",800000.0,Alice,7,
