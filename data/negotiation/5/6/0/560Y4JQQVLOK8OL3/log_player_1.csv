"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's better to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and you can likely get closer to your desired price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is not budging on his offer, and you have already made a counteroffer. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still significantly higher than what John is offering."
