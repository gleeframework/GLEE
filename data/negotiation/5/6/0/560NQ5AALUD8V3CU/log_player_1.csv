Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not convinced that's the best I can get. I'll try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a counter-price of $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is acceptable. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $100.  I'm happy to accept it and close the deal."
