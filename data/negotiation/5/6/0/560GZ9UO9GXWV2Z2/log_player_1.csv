Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for potential bargaining. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring further negotiation before accepting such a low price or resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  Given the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price, and the risk of him walking away altogether is too high."
