"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe it's a good product, that price is a little high for me. I would be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
