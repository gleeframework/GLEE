"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice, but the starting point is too high."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $18,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair offer considering your asking price. I'm happy to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on it. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is still asking too much at $14,000. It's better to get the product for $10,000 from John and avoid further negotiation."
