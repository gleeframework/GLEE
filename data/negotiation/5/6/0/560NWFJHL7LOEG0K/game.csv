"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $18000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair offer considering your asking price. I'm happy to discuss further.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on it. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
