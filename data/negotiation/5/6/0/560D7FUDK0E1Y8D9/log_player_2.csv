"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the significant return you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate a better price or simply purchase the product from John and save a considerable amount of money."
