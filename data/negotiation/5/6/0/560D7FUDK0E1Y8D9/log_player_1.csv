""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly higher initial offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** We know we have a guaranteed $800,000 from John. Our offer needs to be significantly more attractive than that to Bob.

**This offer balances these factors:**

* It's significantly higher than John's offer, making it clear to Bob this is a serious offer.
* It gives Bob a potential $75,000 discount, incentivizing him to accept.
* It leaves Alice with a healthy profit margin above her minimum price."
