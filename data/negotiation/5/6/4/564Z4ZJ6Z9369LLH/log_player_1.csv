Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I've chosen $1,000,000 as my initial offer. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I've kept the message brief and polite, stating the price and highlighting the value to Bob.
* **Strategic Approach:** I'm trying to secure a price closer to my desired value while acknowledging Bob's perspective. This strategy aims to open a dialogue for potential negotiation and increase my chances of getting a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  Selling to Bob for $650,000 would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **I want to continue negotiating.** There's still a chance to reach a more favorable price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've countered with $900,000, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a reasonable price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I've reminded Bob of the product's value, emphasizing the potential for a good deal. 
* **Collaborative Approach:**  The message aims to encourage further negotiation by suggesting finding ""middle ground."" 

**Strategic Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer, I show I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Test the Waters:**  This counter-offer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate.
* **Increased Chances of Success:**  This strategy increases my chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price without having to sell to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  Selling to Bob for $750,000 would result in a considerable loss for me.
* **I'm willing to continue negotiating.**  I believe there's still room to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** However, I want to exhaust all other possibilities with Bob before making a decision.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not under pressure to sell immediately. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **Test the Waters:**  This round allows me to gauge how far Bob is willing to go in his negotiation.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  If I can push Bob to a higher offer, I can potentially achieve a much more favorable outcome than selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make another counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* I'll keep John as a fallback option in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference - how about $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I've countered with $850,000, a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I've emphasized the ""fairness"" of this offer, suggesting it's a good compromise for both parties.
* **Urgency:**  I've subtly hinted at urgency by saying ""allow us to close the deal,"" implying that I might be willing to walk away if we can't reach an agreement soon.

**Strategic Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By splitting the difference, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. 
* **Test the Limits:** This counter-offer allows me to gauge if Bob is willing to make a final concession.
* **Maximize Profit:** This price is still significantly closer to my desired value than Bob's offer, potentially securing a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider making one final counteroffer before resorting to selling to John.
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and weigh the potential outcome against selling to John."
