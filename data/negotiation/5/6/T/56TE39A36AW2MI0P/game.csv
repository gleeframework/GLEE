"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a great product, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $7,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth the investment, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $7,500 is still too low. Let's find a middle ground. How about $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's still within a reasonable range for you. I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $7,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth the investment, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $8,000?  It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",8000.0,Alice,7,
