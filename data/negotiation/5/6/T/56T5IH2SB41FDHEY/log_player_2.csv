{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $110 is a bit steep, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

While $105 is better, we can still try to negotiate a little further. Alice is clearly motivated to sell."

We're inching closer to a price that works for both parties. This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a bit more. How about we meet at $105 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

Alice is holding firm at $105, and it seems unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer gets us the product for less than John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
