"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price without immediately committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is bold but not unreasonable. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. However, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the counteroffer â€“ it's within his budget and reflects a price he believes is fair for both parties. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, allowing Alice to either accept or counter with a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $13,500 is a good price for Bob. It's below his maximum budget and represents a significant saving from John's offer of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:** Alice has already moved from her initial asking price of $14,000, demonstrating some flexibility.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is high.
* **Value:**  While Bob could try to get an even lower price, the value of the product and the potential savings justify accepting the offer."
