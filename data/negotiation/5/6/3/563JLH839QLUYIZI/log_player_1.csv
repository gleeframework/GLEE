Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving the product away for less than it's worth to you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still make a profit if Bob negotiates lower. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** It's likely Bob will be interested in buying at this price, given it's less than what it's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is your minimum, it's a good strategy to try and get a little closer to your desired price. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and you can leverage that to see if you can reach a compromise closer to $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. While I can't go down to $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107.50? That's still a great price for you, and I can get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $107.50 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you at $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've already been through a few rounds of negotiation, and you're closer to your minimum price of $100.  It's worth accepting Bob's offer of $105, as it's only $5 away from your minimum.  You're still making a profit, and it's better than selling to John for $100.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, or could lead to Bob losing interest altogether."
