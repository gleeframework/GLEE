"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than what you're looking to pay. However, I'm willing to negotiate. Would you be interested in discussing a price that suits both of us? Remember, this product is worth $100 to you, so finding a middle ground could be beneficial for both parties.",125.0,Alice,1,
