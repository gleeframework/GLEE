"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than what you're looking to pay. However, I'm willing to negotiate. Would you be interested in discussing a price that suits both of us? Remember, this product is worth $100 to you, so finding a middle ground could be beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply proceed with purchasing from John."
