"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  This would still be a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference - how about $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $100 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a good deal for both of us and lets us close the deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a good compromise and lets us close the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would allow us both to get a good deal and finally close this sale.",105.0,Alice,7,
