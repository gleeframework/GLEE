Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is based on a few assumptions:

* **Risk Aversion:** I'm aiming for a higher price than John's offer, but not so high that I risk losing the sale entirely.  
* **Potential Value:** While I don't know Bob's true value, I'm assuming there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than John. A $3,000 markup seems reasonable.

**Important Note:** This offer is just a starting point.  I'd need more information about Bob and the product to make a more informed decision."
