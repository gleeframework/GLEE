"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering. There's a chance Alice will accept a lower price since the product is only worth $12,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $13,000 is close, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's still lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price of $13,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product at a price he's comfortable with, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
