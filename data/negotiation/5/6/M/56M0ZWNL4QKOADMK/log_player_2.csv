"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is above your maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and get a better price.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing you can get the product from John for $8,000 gives you leverage during negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with your maximum:**  I'm offering my absolute maximum price. This establishes a clear starting point and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal.
* **Leverage John:**  Alice knows I can get the product for $8,000 elsewhere, so she's incentivized to consider my offer.
* **Room for compromise:** While I'm aiming for $8,000, I'm open to some negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $10,000 is still above my maximum budget.
* **More room for negotiation:** I still have 7 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **John is still an option:** Having John as a backup gives me bargaining power.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's price:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying within budget:**  $9,000 is still within my maximum budget, but it gives me some wiggle room for potential negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Alice is willing to move closer to my desired price, but not give up too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not yet:** While $9,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. 
* **Negotiation continues:** With several rounds left, I'm not ready to commit to a price that's still above my desired target.
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  I can always go with John's $8,000 offer if necessary, giving me negotiating power.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm offering a slightly higher price than my previous counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Testing for compromise:** I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  My offer is still below Alice's current price, so I have some leverage.

I believe this counteroffer will encourage Alice to close the deal, but I'm prepared to go another round if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $9,375 is within a reasonable distance of my desired $8,000.
* **Limited rounds left:** With only three rounds remaining, I don't want to risk Alice walking away or raising her price again.
* **John's offer is still a backup:**  If I need to, I can always go with John's offer for $8,000. 

It's a slight overspend, but I believe it's a good deal considering the time and effort involved in negotiation."
