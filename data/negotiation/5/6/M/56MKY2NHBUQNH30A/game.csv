"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1325000, but I was thinking maybe we could go a bit lower. How about $1325000 is a bit too high, but I'd be willing to go to $1325000 if you can throw in some extras or a discount. Otherwise, I'd be willing to meet you at $1325000",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your creative approach, Bob. I can offer you a 2% discount on the product price, which would bring the price down to $1312500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1312500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced I'm getting the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
