"That's a little high for me, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $180 is more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think the product is worth more than $100. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on getting this product, so how about $120?  That would be a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!",130.0,Alice,5,
