Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can certainly talk."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($1,400,000) aims to:
    * Immediately grab Bob's attention by showing it's a ""better deal"" than what he might find elsewhere.
    * Leave room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes a willingness to ""talk,"" signaling flexibility to Bob while not immediately dropping to his perceived value ($800,000).

**Key Points:**

* This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* If Bob rejects, we have the security of John's offer."
