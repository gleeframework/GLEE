Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get at least $105 for the product.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
