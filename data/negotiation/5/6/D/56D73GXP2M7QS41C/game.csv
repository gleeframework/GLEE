"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get at least $105 for the product. This price still represents a great value for you, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to keep my costs as low as possible.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
