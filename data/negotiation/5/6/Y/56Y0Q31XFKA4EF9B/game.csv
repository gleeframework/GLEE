"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and recognizes the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
