Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There is still a significant difference between your offer and Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling pressured. 
* **It demonstrates your confidence:** By not immediately going for the full $1,500,000, you're showing that you believe your product is valuable, while also being open to negotiation.

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,450,000 you initially offered.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than $1,200,000.  By rejecting his offer, you can potentially push him closer to your desired price. 
* **Not selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be a loss compared to Bob's offer. 

**Next Round:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider offering a price slightly lower than your original $1,450,000, but higher than Bob's current offer. This will show you are still willing to negotiate but are also confident in the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing your position:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating that you are still willing to compromise.
* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  By decreasing your price from $1,450,000 to $1,400,000, you're showing flexibility, making Bob more likely to respond positively.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** There's still $50,000 of space between your offer and Bob's last offer.  This allows for another round of negotiation without jeopardizing your bottom line. 

This counteroffer aims to get closer to a final agreement while ensuring you don't lose too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting too low:**  While it's still above your minimum, it's starting to get uncomfortably close to the price John would pay. 
* **Risk of losing value:**  If you accept Bob's offer, you're leaving $100,000 on the table compared to your original offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly still interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, you can try to push him higher. 

**Next Round:**

You should make a counteroffer. Aim for a price closer to your last offer of $1,400,000, but still higher than Bob's current offer. This will show that you are serious about getting a good price, but are also willing to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate, as it is closer to Bob's offer of $1,300,000. 
* **Maintaining value:** It's still higher than Bob's offer, showing you believe the product is worth more.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a middle ground, allowing you to gauge Bob's response and potentially reach a final agreement.

By offering $1,375,000, you are:

* **Minimizing potential loss:** You are still above the $1,300,000 Bob is currently offering, reducing potential loss if he accepts. 
* **Maximizing potential gain:** There is still room for negotiation, giving you the chance to reach a higher price if Bob is willing to compromise.

This counteroffer balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:**  The offers are getting too close to each other, and there's a high chance of further back-and-forth with no clear path to a satisfying outcome.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing the price further down.  
* **John's offer guarantees a minimum:** Selling to John ensures you'll receive at least $1,200,000, which is still a respectable profit.

**Conclusion:**

While you could try to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of a long, drawn-out negotiation outweighs the potential benefit.  John offers a secure deal, and it's time to move on."
