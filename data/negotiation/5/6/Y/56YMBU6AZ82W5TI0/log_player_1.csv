"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $80, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $100 is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $120. This increases the likelihood of him accepting.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left some room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the remaining rounds. I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind if negotiations with Bob become too difficult or time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $80 is my minimum, it's still not a great deal for me.  I'd prefer to try and get closer to my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Space:** I have 8 more rounds to try and improve the offer.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Selling to John:**  There's no immediate need to sell to John. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $80. I'll aim for a price that's still attractive to Bob but closer to my desired profit. I'll need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $80, but that's still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering $90 is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to my initial offer and a better deal for me than $80.
* **Attractive to Bob:** $90 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $120.  It's a more reasonable midpoint than his initial counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not giving in entirely to Bob's initial counteroffer, keeping some leverage for future rounds if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'll watch closely to see if Bob accepts this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate in subsequent rounds, adjusting my strategy based on his responses and the remaining time. I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind, especially if the negotiations start to drag on or become too unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $85?  That's a decent compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in round 4.  It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer from Bob. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. If I don't accept, Bob might become even more stubborn or make lower counteroffers.
* **Selling to John:** While $85 is only slightly better than selling to John,  it's a better outcome than potentially losing the deal altogether.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This secures a good deal for me, even if it's not the ideal outcome.  I'll also be sure to learn from this experience for future negotiations and try to find ways to secure better deals early on."
