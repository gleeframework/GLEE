Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $140 is close to Bob's perceived value of $120. While it's unlikely he'll pay $140, it's a starting point that might entice him.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might push Bob to make a decision quickly rather than overthink it.
* **Backup Buyer:**  You have the security of John as a buyer, ensuring you'll get at least $150 if Bob declines. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit. If Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might need to lower your asking price closer to $120. 
* Observe Bob's reaction to your initial offer. His response will guide your next move in the negotiation."
