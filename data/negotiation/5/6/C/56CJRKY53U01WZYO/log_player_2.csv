"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special starting price of $12,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a competitive offer considering its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for a significantly lower price.  It's best to try and negotiate with Alice first, but if she won't budge, he can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $11,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Since John is selling the product for $8,000, Bob should go with the guaranteed deal and buy from John."
