{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is higher than Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $1,200,000 is still above your minimum price of $1,500,000, leaving you with a profit.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value and leaves room for negotiation.

This offer also sets the stage for potential counteroffers from Bob, allowing you to explore different scenarios and ultimately maximize your earnings."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can negotiate a better price."

How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's less than $1,500,000, especially since I can sell to John for that amount. I'll try to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
