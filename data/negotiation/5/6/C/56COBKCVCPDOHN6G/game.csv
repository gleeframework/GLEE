"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. This product would be very valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to offer you $760,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to invest in this product, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great value for you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
