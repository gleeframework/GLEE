"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm initially offering it for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to make it more appealing.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking for Bob's thoughts encourages him to engage and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$120 is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is a good starting point for negotiations, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he expressed interest in the product. 
* **More information needed:**  I need more information about Bob's motivation and budget to determine a counteroffer that could be accepted."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a step in the right direction,  I need to get at least $130 to make this work.  What about we split the difference and go with $125?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By suggesting a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Reminding Bob that I need to get a certain price reinforces the value of the product. 
* **Clear and Concise:**  The counteroffer is clear and avoids unnecessary fluff, focusing on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $125, which would be $122.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $2.50 below my minimum, which is a small difference.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing Bob's interest and being forced to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time pressure:**  We are already in the 4th round, and the negotiation is moving slowly. Accepting Bob's offer is the best way to secure a deal quickly."
