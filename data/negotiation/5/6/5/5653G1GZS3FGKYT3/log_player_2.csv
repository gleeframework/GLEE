"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a fantastic deal, considering it's worth at least $10000 to me, and I know it's worth even more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being flexible. However,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000? It's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target price:**  $13,000 is only $1,000 higher than Bob's counteroffer of $12,000.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  John is selling the product for $15,000, which is $2,000 more than Alice's current offer. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Further negotiation might drag on and Alice might become less willing to compromise.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. It's a good deal for both parties, and avoids the risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate or Bob having to pay more from John."
