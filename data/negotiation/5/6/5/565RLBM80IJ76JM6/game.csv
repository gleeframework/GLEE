"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground so we can both be satisfied.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. Let's close this deal!",825000.0,Alice,5,
