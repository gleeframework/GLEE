"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Considering its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this offer is a strong reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more to Alice than it is to Bob, and she's starting at a price that's well above Bob's maximum. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. He should continue to counter-offer and try to negotiate a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a deal. While I'm motivated to sell, I have to be realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price. There's still room for both parties to find a compromise that works for them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still too high for me. To reach a deal, I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $960,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer and reflects the true value of the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and they've only got 3 rounds left. It's unlikely that Alice will come down further, especially since she's said this is a competitive offer.  Bob has a better chance of saving money by buying from John."
