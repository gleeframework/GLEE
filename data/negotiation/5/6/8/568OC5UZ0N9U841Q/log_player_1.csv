Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a good price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing Bob values it at $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering a price lower than my minimum of $80 allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages negotiation rather than being too aggressive. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer of $90 means a profit of $10, which is better than my minimum of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could counteroffer and try to get closer to $100, there's no guarantee Bob will accept.  The risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $80 isn't worth it for an extra $10. 
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further takes time, and I'm already making a good profit.  It's more efficient to accept the offer."
