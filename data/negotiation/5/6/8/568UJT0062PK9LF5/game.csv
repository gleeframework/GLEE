"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still confident it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",10000.0,Alice,5,
