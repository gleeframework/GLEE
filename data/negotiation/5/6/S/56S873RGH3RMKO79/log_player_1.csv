Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at or below $12,000 leaves money on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $14,500 price gives Bob the impression of a potential deal while leaving you space to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
