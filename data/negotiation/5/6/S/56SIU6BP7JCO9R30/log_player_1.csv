**Reasoning:**

While ideally, we'd want a price closer to $1,325,000, Bob is sticking firm at $1,300,000.  We've made progress, and he's shown a willingness to negotiate.  

* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to push might alienate Bob, and there's no guarantee he'll go higher. He might even lower his offer.
* **Time constraint:** We have a limited number of rounds, and we're already past the halfway point.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting $1,300,000 is a substantial profit, and it's better than risking the deal falling through and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000.

It's time to secure a good deal rather than risking it for a marginally better one."
