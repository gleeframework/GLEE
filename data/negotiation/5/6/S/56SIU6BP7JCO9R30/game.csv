"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to see a similar move from your side.  How about $1,325,000?  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
