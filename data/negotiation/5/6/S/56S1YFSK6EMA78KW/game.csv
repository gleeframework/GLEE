"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's something that's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I know it's a significant investment, but I'm confident that the potential benefits will far outweigh the cost.  Let me know your thoughts and if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
