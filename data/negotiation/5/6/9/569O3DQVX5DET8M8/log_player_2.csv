"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product from John, there's no immediate incentive to accept Alice's offer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate with Alice or find another seller who might offer a lower price."
