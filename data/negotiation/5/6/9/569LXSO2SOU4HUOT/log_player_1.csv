Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Justification for price:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's worth to encourage him to consider the higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup buyer."
