"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,150,000 is simply too far below the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,200,000?  This would be a fair price for me and allows you to move the product quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
