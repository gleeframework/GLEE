{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  Paying $12,000 is better than $15,000, but Bob can likely do better. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate.**  He can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. 
* **There's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer.** But Bob has nothing to lose by trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is aiming for a significant discount.** $10,500 is a substantial drop from Alice's offer of $12,000. 
* **This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget.** It's lower than his maximum price of $15,000. 
* **The offer is aggressive, but it's a starting point for negotiation.**  Bob can adjust his counteroffer depending on Alice's response."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer.**  This indicates that Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Bob is still aiming to save money.**  $12,500 is still a considerable amount, and Bob can try to push for a lower price.
* **Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to counteroffer.**  He can try to meet Alice halfway or even make a slightly lower counteroffer to see if she will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is trying to find a middle ground.** He's increased his offer from $10,500 to $11,500, moving closer to Alice's $12,500.
* **This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate.** It signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can still lower his price slightly, but he wants to avoid getting too close to his maximum limit before seeing Alice's response."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now higher than Bob's previous counteroffer.** This indicates that she might not be willing to go lower.
* **Buying from Alice at $13,000 is still cheaper than buying from John at $15,000.** Bob is saving $2,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **The negotiation process has been lengthy, and Bob is likely getting close to his limit.** It's a gamble, but accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a decent price and avoids further negotiation."
