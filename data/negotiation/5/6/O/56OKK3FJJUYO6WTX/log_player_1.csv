Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price, given the value you place on it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The Message:** This message is friendly and establishes a willingness to negotiate while also highlighting the value of the product to Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  A starting point that isn't too aggressive gives Bob room to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Keep John as a backup:** The threat of selling to John keeps Bob motivated to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off the mark. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  John is still a viable option if I can't get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you value the product at $1,000,000, so how about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $875,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to achieve a fair price for my product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This approach acknowledges Bob's perspective while still maintaining a price that's above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($1,000,000) reinforces the fairness of my offer.
* **Focus on a mutually beneficial outcome:**  Using phrases like ""find a solution"" and ""works for both of us"" creates a collaborative tone.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:**  While showing flexibility, it doesn't give away too much.
* **Keep Bob engaged:**  The offer is closer to his position, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Preserve my backup option:**  The threat of selling to John remains, motivating Bob to come closer to my desired price."
