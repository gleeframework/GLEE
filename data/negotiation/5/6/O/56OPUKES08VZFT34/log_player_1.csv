I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a good compromise because:

* It's still significantly more than Bob values the product at, giving me a good profit.
* It's less than what John is willing to pay, ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially higher sale. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob potentially interested in the deal."
