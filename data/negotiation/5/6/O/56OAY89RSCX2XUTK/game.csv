"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $20,000, considering its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you do $17,000? That's a more reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I need to stick within a certain budget. How about $12,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would allow me to recoup a more significant portion of the value this product represents.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I can do $13,000. This is a fair offer considering its value to me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
