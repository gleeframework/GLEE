Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives Bob the impression of potential savings while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A collaborative and positive tone sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good chunk of money, it's still significantly less than both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and my initial offer. Bob's counter-offer is closer to his perceived value than mine. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true worth and my investment in it."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price, but not drastically. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the price adjustment helps Bob understand my perspective.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer, encouraging him to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is definitely moving closer to a price I might consider, but $975,000 is still under my minimum. It seems like he's getting to the top of his budget. At this point, I need to decide if squeezing out a bit more from Bob is worth the risk of him walking away. I'm leaning towards one more counter-offer before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You've made a strong case for its value to you. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my bottom line.  This adds weight to the offer and signals I'm serious.
* **Justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's efforts while reiterating that this is a major price drop on my part.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,000,000 mark is a nice, round number that might be psychologically appealing. It also leaves me with a substantial profit.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer of $1,200,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potentially small gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I'm still a bit above $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $975,000 is his final offer. While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, it's unlikely he'll budge. Accepting John's offer of $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further failed negotiations with Bob. Sometimes, a guaranteed sale is better than a potentially higher, but uncertain one."
