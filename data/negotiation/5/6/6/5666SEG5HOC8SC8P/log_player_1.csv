Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, making this her minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Sweet Spot:** Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes her potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,199,999. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a price below its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** Offering the product just below Bob's valuation ($1,199,999) makes it highly compelling for him to accept. 
* **Messaging:** The message emphasizes the ""unique opportunity"" and positions the price as a bargain, playing on Bob's potential fear of missing out.

**Why this Strategy Works**

* **High Probability of Acceptance:** Bob is likely to accept because the price is significantly lower than his perceived value.
* **Maximizes Profit (Compared to John):** While Alice could get $1,500,000 from John, selling to Bob at $1,199,999 still nets her a considerable profit and avoids potential delays or complications of waiting for John's purchase.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no reason to prioritize a quick sale. If she needs immediate liquidity, selling directly to John might be preferable despite the slightly lower profit."
