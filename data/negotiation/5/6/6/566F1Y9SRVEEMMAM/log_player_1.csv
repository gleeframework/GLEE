"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a high initial price to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $1,000,000 is still lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** My message is friendly and optimistic, hoping to create a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still aim for a higher price. 
* **More negotiation rounds:** I have 9 more rounds to work with, and there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Leaving the door open for further negotiation:** Rejecting his offer doesn't mean I'm completely closed off. I can counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. Let's split the difference and finalize this sale."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  
* **Still above my minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000.
* **Emphasizing a win-win situation:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. How about $925,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $925,000 is very close to my ideal price, and I'm not sure if I can get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Potential for future negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more in later rounds if we build trust.
* **Minimizing risk:** It's risky to keep rejecting offers, as Bob might get frustrated or find another seller. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit with less risk."
