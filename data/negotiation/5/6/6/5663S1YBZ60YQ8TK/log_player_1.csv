Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit. 
* **Gauge interest:** Bob's response to this offer will indicate his level of interest and potential price flexibility. 
* **Backup option:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it for my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
