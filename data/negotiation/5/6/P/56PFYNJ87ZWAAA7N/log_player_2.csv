"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product for $11,000. I believe this product will be highly valuable to you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,250 is less than Bob's $12,000 limit.
* **It's a better deal than John:**  $10,250 is significantly lower than John's $12,000 price.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice might reject further counteroffers and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it secures the product within Bob's budget and offers a significant saving compared to John."
