{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By offering a price below my minimum, I allow for potential counteroffers from Bob, opening up the possibility of finding a price that works for both of us. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential for a higher offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum of $150, and I'm not willing to sell for such a loss. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, as he has shown interest in the product. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not in a rush to accept a drastically low offer. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum of $150, allowing me to make a profit even if this is the final price.
* **Reasoning provided:**  I'm explaining my reasoning for the price to help Bob understand my perspective and potentially encourage a further compromise. 

**Next Steps:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to make a further concession or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. $110 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go up to $90. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $90 is still significantly below my minimum of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss.
* **John's offer is a good safety net:** I have a guaranteed $150 from John, which makes me less inclined to settle for a much lower price from Bob.
* **Potential for a slight compromise:**  While $90 is too low, there's a chance I can still negotiate a slightly higher price from Bob.  I'll use the next round to try and find a middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $90 but still below my minimum. My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, without sacrificing too much of my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $100 for the product.  This price reflects its value and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** This counteroffer is a small step down from my previous offer, showing I am still willing to compromise. 
* **Maintaining profit:**  $100 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  My message highlights the need for a ""middle ground"" and a mutually beneficial outcome, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make a further concession or move on to John's offer."
