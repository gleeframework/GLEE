"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1100000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $950000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is simply too far below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This demonstrates my commitment to working with you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the right price. Can you meet me at $975000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, but $975000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1012500? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will deliver significant value for your investment.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. Can you meet me at $985000? I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",985000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a fair price considering its potential. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've thought it over, and I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $995000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",995000.0,Bob,10,
