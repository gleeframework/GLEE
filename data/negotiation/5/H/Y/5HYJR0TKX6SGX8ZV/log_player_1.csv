"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I could accept and walk away with something, I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject and try to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear lower limit for the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject and see if he'll come up again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value.  While there's a chance he might increase his offer further, I've already been through several rounds and don't want to risk losing too much time.  It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John."
