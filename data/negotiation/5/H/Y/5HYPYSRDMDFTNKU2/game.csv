"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
