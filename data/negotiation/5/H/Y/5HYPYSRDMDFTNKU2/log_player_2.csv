"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,250.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
