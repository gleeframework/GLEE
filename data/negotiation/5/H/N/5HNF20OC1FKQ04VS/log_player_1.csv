"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this price further, but I believe it accurately reflects the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:**  Starting with a high offer of $2,300,000 (a significant markup from both your minimum and Bob's perceived value) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence & Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly stating your minimum price.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this price further"" signals willingness to negotiate while not appearing desperate. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a highly favorable deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our initial ask.  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table.  By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This price reflects the value it brings and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are lowering our price by $200,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still remaining significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value without being too aggressive, aiming to keep the tone collaborative.
* **Midpoint Target:** This counter-offer aims to move the negotiation closer to the $1,950,000 midpoint between Bob's last offer and our previous ask.

We are aiming for a compromise, but not rushing the negotiation. We have time and alternatives on our side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met us precisely in the middle, offering $1,950,000. This is a substantial profit above our $1,500,000 minimum and a good deal overall. While we *might* be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or that further negotiation could become protracted. Accepting now secures a significant win."
