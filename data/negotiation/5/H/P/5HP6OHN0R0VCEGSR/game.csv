"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10500? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $9800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal.  $9800 is getting closer, but I'm still not there.  How about $10200? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10200 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
