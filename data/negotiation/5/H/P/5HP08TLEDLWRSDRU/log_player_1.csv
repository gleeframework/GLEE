Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more than Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's $12,000 valuation, the message hints at the product's high value, justifying the higher asking price.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price during further negotiation."
