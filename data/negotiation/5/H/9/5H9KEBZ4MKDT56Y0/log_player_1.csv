"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $150.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range considering Bob's value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation, which can make Bob more willing to engage. 
* **Asking for his opinion:** By asking for his thoughts, I'm showing that I'm open to compromise and am not just pushing a fixed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $130 to me. Can we negotiate down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I can still try to get a better price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to explore it further. 
* **Strategic advantage:**  By rejecting, I can control the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Middle ground:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This can be appealing to Bob as a fair compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm remaining friendly and open to further negotiation, which can help keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $110 as the price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum price:** Bob is sticking to his $110 offer, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited rounds:** We are already in round 4, leaving only 6 more rounds to close the deal.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of lower offer:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks that he might not budge from his offer, and I might end up with nothing, or even a lower price in subsequent rounds.

**Conclusion:** Given the limited rounds and the guarantee of $120 with John, it's more sensible to sell to John and secure a profit rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
