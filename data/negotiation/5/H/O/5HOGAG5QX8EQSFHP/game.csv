"Alice, $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500. This is my best offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can you consider a price of $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $8,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere for this product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
