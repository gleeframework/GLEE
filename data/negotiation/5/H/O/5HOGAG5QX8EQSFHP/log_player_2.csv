"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for a significantly lower price.  There's no need to engage in a negotiation when a better deal is readily available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

Bob is starting with a firm counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This lets Alice know that he's serious about getting the product but is not willing to pay her full asking price. He's also giving a reason for his offer, which helps build rapport and shows he's engaging in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can you consider a price of $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he's still willing to pay more than he needs to. He's still better off buying the product from John for $8,000, as it's within his budget and a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $8,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere for this product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

Bob is holding firm on his counteroffer.  He's reiterating his previous offer, reminding Alice that he's not willing to pay more.  He's also subtly threatening to walk away if she doesn't accept his offer, putting pressure on her to come down in price."
