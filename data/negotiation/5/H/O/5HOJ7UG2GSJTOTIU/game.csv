"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  How about we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
