"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute limit. If that's acceptable, I'd be happy to purchase the product.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 150 is your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for 155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go.",155.0,Alice,5,
