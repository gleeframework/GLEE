"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $140.  I'm really motivated to make this deal work, and I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're motivated to make a deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Would you be willing to consider that?",135.0,Bob,6,
