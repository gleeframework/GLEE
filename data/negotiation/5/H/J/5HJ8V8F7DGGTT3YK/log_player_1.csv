"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm still aiming for a price higher than $100, but I'm also showing flexibility to encourage Bob to accept.  $105 is a reasonable compromise that might appeal to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for more, $95 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
