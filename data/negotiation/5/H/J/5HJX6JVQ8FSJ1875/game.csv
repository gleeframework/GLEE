"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate you making an offer, $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low for you. How about we try to find a compromise at $100? I think that's a fair deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $160? I'm willing to move a little closer to your price if you can do the same.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. It seems like we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
