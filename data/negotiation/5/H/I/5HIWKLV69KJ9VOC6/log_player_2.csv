"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since you have a fallback option with John. By rejecting the offer, you initiate a negotiation process that could potentially lead to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. While it's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, this initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $775,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $850,000.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially going back up to her original price or even higher exists.  At this point, $775,000 is a good price and saves me a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
