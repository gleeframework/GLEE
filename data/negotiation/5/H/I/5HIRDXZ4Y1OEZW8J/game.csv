"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16,000, which is a significant discount from my original price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I need to consider other interested buyers, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this offer open.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500, as I've already given you a significant discount. If you're still interested, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but $13,000 is too low for me.",13500.0,Alice,9,
