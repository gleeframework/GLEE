``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,200,000, but it's a gamble that could pay off if Bob values the product even higher. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:** A higher price means a larger profit margin.
* **Risk Mitigation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Unknown Value:** I have no information about Bob's valuation, so I'm using a price that leaves room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects the offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
