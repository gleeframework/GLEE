Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed profit from John."
