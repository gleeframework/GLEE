"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is too high, and Bob can get the product for less from John. However, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to negotiate further before committing to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves a potential profit for Alice.  It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer and shows Bob's serious intent to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the $800,000 he could get from John. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, attempting to reach a price closer to his target before potentially committing to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise, but still staying below Alice's current price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while putting pressure on Alice to meet him halfway."
