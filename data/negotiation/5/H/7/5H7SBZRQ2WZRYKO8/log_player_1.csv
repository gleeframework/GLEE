{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and the value Bob places on the product ($12,000).  This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm confident this product is worth more than $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Given my current financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my ideal price.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and avoids any further risk of losing the deal."
