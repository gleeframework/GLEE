Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($150) to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Minimum:** This price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($120), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a high price and ensuring I don't lose the sale by pricing it too high."
