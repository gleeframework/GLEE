"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $110 for the product. This way, you get a great deal, and I receive a profit. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
