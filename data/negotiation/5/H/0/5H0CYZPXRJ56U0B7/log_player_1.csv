Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a good starting point since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's room for me to negotiate lower if Bob rejects the offer, but I still want to maximize my profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal for Bob. 

This approach balances my desire for a good profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
