Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a good value considering its potential.  I'm open to further discussion if this offer isn't acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $900,000? This reflects some flexibility on my part while still recognizing the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $850,000 exceeds my minimum acceptable price and provides a $50,000 profit above what John is offering. It's a strong offer at this stage of the negotiation."
