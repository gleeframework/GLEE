"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to your business. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the price of the product. I'm willing to consider purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1350000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1275000. Can you consider that?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1275000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to meet you in the middle again. Let's go with $1312500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still not comfortable with $1312500. I'm willing to go up to $1275000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $1290000?",1290000.0,Bob,6,
