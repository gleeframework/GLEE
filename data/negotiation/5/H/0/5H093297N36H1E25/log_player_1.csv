Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a reasonable margin to negotiate, while also ensuring I get a profit above my minimum.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer and aim for something closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $125 is a fair compromise and significantly above my minimum. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
