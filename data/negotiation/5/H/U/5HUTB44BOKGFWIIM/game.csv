"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the product is worth $8,000 to me, I'm prepared to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer of $10,000, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it gives you a reasonable profit margin. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
