Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** It gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Lower than your minimum:** It allows for potential negotiation without you losing too much.
* **A reasonable starting point:**  It leaves space for a middle ground to be found.

This offer will likely lead to a back-and-forth negotiation, but it sets you up in a strong position to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

You're in a strong position.  John is willing to pay your minimum, so you have a safety net. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Counter with a higher price:**  Aim for a price closer to your desired $1,200,000, but be willing to compromise.
* **Gauge Bob's commitment:** By seeing how far he's willing to go, you can better understand if he's genuinely interested in buying the product.

**Note:**  The key is to balance your desire to maximize profit with the potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Increase from Bob's offer:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer of $1,050,000, showing that you're willing to negotiate but not accepting his low price.
* **Closer to your desired price:**  $1,100,000 is closer to your minimum desired price of $1,200,000, making this offer more attractive to you than Bob's previous offer.
* **Still leaves room for negotiation:** This leaves some room for compromise, as you are still $100,000 away from your minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, but also sends a clear message that you are not desperate to sell. By steadily raising the price, you are putting pressure on Bob to increase his offer or risk losing the deal. You are also keeping John as a backup option, which strengthens your negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's a slight improvement over his previous offer, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for you. 

**Strategy:**

* **Keep pushing for a higher price:** By rejecting his offer, you show that you're not willing to settle for a low price. This puts pressure on Bob to increase his offer. 
* **John is your safety net:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John, who will pay your minimum. This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob.
* **Potential for a counteroffer close to your minimum:** By continuing to negotiate, you might be able to get Bob to raise his offer closer to your desired price of $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your minimum. You could try something like $1,150,000, but be prepared to adjust depending on Bob's response."
