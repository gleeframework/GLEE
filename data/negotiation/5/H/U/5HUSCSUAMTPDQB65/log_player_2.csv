"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and I'm hopeful Alice will be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still above my target.  I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price and see if I can get closer to my goal.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still below Alice's current price. I'm hoping to meet her halfway and find a price we can both agree on.  If Alice is willing to negotiate, I'm confident we can reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, and her latest offer is still significantly higher than my target. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like we're at an impasse. To avoid further back-and-forth, I'm going to go with the sure thing and buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While I might have been able to get a slightly better deal with Alice if I continued negotiating, I'm not confident that it would be worth the time and effort. Buying from John is the safest and most efficient option."
