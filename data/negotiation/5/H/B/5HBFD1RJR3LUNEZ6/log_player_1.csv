{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also mindful of my minimum value of $15,000 and my ability to sell to John for that price if negotiations fail. This offer allows me to potentially make a profit while also keeping the door open to a possible counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would like to reach an agreement with Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $11,000?  This is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still below my acceptable range.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll offer $10,250. Can we meet in the middle this time? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close enough to my desired range that I'm willing to accept it. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob. However, continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, and I'm happy with this price."
