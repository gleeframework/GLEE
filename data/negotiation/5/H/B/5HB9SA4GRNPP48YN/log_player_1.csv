Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $1,400,000. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to further discussion, but let's aim to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
