"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's also quite high considering her value of the product is only $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** Alice's offer of $1,400,000 was well above your budget and your ideal purchase price. 
* **Counter-Offer Logic:** You've offered a price that's still profitable for Alice, while also allowing you to save a significant amount.  This leaves room for further negotiation if needed, without pushing her too far. 
* **Communication:**  You've provided a clear and polite message explaining your reasoning."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to further discussion, but let's aim to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, coming down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000. 
* **Value Comparison:** This offer is still within your budget and significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could potentially negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers or become unwilling to negotiate.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking losing the deal."
