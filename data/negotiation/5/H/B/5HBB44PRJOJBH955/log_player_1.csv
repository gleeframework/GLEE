{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. This helps build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. I will consider his counteroffer and aim to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Knowing My Floor:** I'm aware of my minimum price ($150) and the availability of another buyer (John). This gives me the confidence to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is too low, it indicates his willingness to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting My Value:**  Selling to John for $150 is a viable option, but I'm still optimistic about finding a better price through negotiation.  I'm willing to invest a little more time to see if I can improve the outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $60 is far too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($60). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $115, he's getting a good deal.
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $115 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  While I'm open to negotiation, there's a risk that continuing to bargain with Bob will only lead to further concessions from my side and potentially a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures that I meet my minimum price and secure a sale. This is a guaranteed outcome, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower price or a failed sale. 

I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum price requirement."
