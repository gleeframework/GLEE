Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can either counteroffer or accept his counteroffer, depending on his offer and my desire to close the deal quickly. I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell the product to John. 

Bob's offer is getting closer, but the negotiation is taking time and the risk of not closing the deal is increasing.  Selling to John guarantees my desired profit, and I can always explore other opportunities later."
