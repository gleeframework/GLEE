"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,5,
