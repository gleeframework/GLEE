Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very slowly coming down in price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get a deal that's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John."
