Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $1,650,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is the most strategic decision.  Here's why:

* **Exceeding John's Offer:** While we could go to another round of negotiations, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $150,000 over selling to John. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means receiving the money sooner.  The longer the negotiations drag on, the more that money is theoretically devalued by time.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's compromise shows a willingness to make a deal, which can be beneficial for future business interactions."
