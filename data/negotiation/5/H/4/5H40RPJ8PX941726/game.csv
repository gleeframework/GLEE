"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I cannot disclose the specific nature of the product, I can assure you it is worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential. This is a one-time opportunity, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
