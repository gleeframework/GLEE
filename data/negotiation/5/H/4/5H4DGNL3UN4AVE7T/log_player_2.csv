# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to save $1,000 compared to John, you have room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, I'm not quite ready to pay $11,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This price is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  You can save $250 compared to buying from John and you're still within your budget. There is no guarantee that Alice will come down further and it's better to accept this deal and secure the product."
