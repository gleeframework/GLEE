Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, but I understand it might be more than you're willing to pay. If you're interested, I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with my desired price of $150, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm acknowledging that the price might be high for Bob, but I'm open to negotiating. This shows flexibility and might encourage Bob to counter-offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I haven't explicitly stated the product's value to me, but I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, hinting at its value.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:**  By starting high, I increase the chance of getting closer to my ideal price.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  The open negotiation aspect allows Bob to feel comfortable exploring options, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  My fallback option with John ensures I'm not pressured into selling at a lower price out of desperation."
