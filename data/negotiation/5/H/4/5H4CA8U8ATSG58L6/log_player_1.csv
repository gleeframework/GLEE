Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $18000. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me in the middle at $15500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 17000}

While $14,500 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to go that low yet.  I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll try to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $14,500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low. I'm not confident we can reach a deal that's profitable for me. It's time to move on and sell the product to John."
