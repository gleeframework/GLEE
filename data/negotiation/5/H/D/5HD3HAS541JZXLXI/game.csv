"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're able to move closer to a fair price. I would like to propose $9,500 for the product. This keeps my budget in check while still being a fair offer for you. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This gives you a good price while still allowing me to get closer to my target.  Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. This maintains my budget constraints while still providing a fair deal for you. I hope this proposal works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
