"Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, considering its true value. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
