,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $125?  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then. ",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $140. It's the minimum I need to earn to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to meet me at $137.50? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down a bit, $137.50 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132.50, which is a fair middle ground.  Let me know if you're open to that.",132.5,Bob,6,
