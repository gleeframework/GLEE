"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value I've put into this product. What do you think?

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,050,000.

Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the product without further haggling."
