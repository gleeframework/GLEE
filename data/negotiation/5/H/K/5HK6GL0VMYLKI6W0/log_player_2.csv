"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer of $9,000 and try to get a better price. You have room to negotiate since you can always walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, a counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point. This leaves some room for negotiation, but still provides a significant saving compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price from $9,000 to $9,200.  While this is still better than John's price, it's closer to your maximum price.  There's still room to negotiate down further, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best option to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price has increased slightly, but you're still better off negotiating than buying from John.  This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's current price, leaving room for further negotiation but also showing that you are serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price and it seems like she's not willing to negotiate much further.  You can get the product from John for $10,000, which is only $600 more than Alice's current offer. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that you might not reach an agreement with Alice, and you'll end up buying from John anyway.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John now."
