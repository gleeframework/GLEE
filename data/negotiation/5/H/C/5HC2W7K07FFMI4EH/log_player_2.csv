"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $120 from John, you can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $85, which is still more than the product is worth to her ($80). This gives her a good profit margin while being a significant discount for me compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me.  It's lower than John's offer of $120 and closer to my ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely. It's a good compromise."
