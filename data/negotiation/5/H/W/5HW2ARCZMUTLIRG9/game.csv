"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $180 is already a significant discount on the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? This seems fair considering what you'll gain from it.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be reasonable too.  How about $130? This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",130.0,Alice,5,
