"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.  It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lowball offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. Since I have the option of buying from John for $100, I'm setting the bar at my maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $180 is already a significant discount on the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? This seems fair considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so I have time to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving my offer up to $120, showing some flexibility. It's still below Alice's latest offer, but it's a more reasonable price point. I'm aiming to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be reasonable too.  How about $130? This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $130 is still above my budget.  While there are still rounds remaining, I'm not confident that we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John at $100 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
