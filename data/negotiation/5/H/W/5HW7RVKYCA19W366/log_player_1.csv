Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for the product. Would you consider reducing the price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while still being a reasonable deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. Could we meet closer to my budget?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob is firmly rooted at $8,000 and unlikely to budge. It's not worth my time to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John."
