"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,000,000.  That means there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While the product is certainly appealing,  $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $925,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your desire for a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to negotiate, and we're still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $925,000 is still a bit high for me though. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value and the time and effort I've invested in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is at $900,000 and isn't budging further.  While I could keep negotiating, the risk of going over my budget is increasing, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower than John's price.  It's time to secure the product with John for a guaranteed $800,000."
