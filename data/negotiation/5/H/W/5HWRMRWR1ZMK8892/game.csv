"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While the product is certainly appealing,  $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $925,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your desire for a fair price.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $925,000 is still a bit high for me though. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value and the time and effort I've invested in it.",900000.0,Alice,5,
