,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I can do $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be interested?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not comfortable with $125. I can do $135, and that's my final offer. If you're still interested, let me know!",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  If you're serious about making a deal, I think this is the best we can do.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've already said $135 is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than that. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see what happens next.",135.0,Alice,7,
