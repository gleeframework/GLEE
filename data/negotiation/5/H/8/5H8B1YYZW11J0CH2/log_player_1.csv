"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves me with a potential profit.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, inviting him to engage in a negotiation. 

I'm prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary, but I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not in a rush to sell. 

* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Learning about Bob's budget:** Bob's initial low offer gives me insight into his financial limitations. This information is valuable for future negotiations.

I'm willing to entertain counteroffers, but I'm not going to accept the first offer that meets my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,500,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price, but not by a huge margin. This shows Bob I'm willing to work with him but also that I believe in the value of the product.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the new price is a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a win-win solution to encourage further negotiation.

I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob without sacrificing too much of my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's counteroffer is only $150,000 lower than my last offer and is getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Time constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing out on this deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's always a chance Bob could walk away, and I'd be left with the lower price from John.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale at a price that's still profitable for me."
