Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values it at $15,000, he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it immediately without the risk of losing it to someone else.
* **Backup Option:** I have a safety net with John. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always come down a bit or move on to John knowing I won't be making a loss."
