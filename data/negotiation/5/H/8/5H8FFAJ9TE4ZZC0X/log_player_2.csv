"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a profitable range for her. Starting low leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $82.50 is still too high. I'll try to inch my offer up a bit and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice that I am willing to negotiate upwards, but also sets a firm boundary that is still significantly below her initial asking price and my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to make sure it's worth it. How about $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering the product at her own valuation. This is the best possible price I can get from her, so it makes sense to accept the offer now."
