Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while I have another interested buyer, I'm extending this offer to you first at a price of $14,000.  Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above that.
* **First Offer High:** Starting with a higher offer ($14,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning John (the other buyer) subtly introduces a sense of competition, potentially motivating Bob to act faster.  

**Important:** This is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine the next steps in the negotiation.  If he outright rejects the $14,000, Alice can then decide whether to lower the price or move on to John."
