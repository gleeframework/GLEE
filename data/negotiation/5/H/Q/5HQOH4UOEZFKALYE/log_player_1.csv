Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""time-sensitive""  might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You might need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and any additional information you gather during the negotiation process."
