"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer significantly below my actual budget. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below $80.  Alice might be motivated to avoid losing the sale altogether and accept a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above my ideal price and what John offers. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer but keeping it below both her current offer and my maximum price from John. This shows willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $75. I can offer it to you for $85, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is down to $85, which is only slightly above John's price.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal entirely.  It's a good price, even if it's not the absolute lowest I could theoretically get."
