Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $15,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable price point and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,500 more than my minimum and I don't want to risk another round of negotiation. It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher offer from Bob.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $13,500."
