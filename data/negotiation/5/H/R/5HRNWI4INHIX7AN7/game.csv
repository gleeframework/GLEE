"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000. I can do $1050000, but that's as low as I can go.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit too high for me. I can do $950000, can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I can do $1050000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need you to meet me at $1020000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
