"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth a lot more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** I'm keeping the price high enough that I can still walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left, which is plenty of time to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob. 

**Next Step:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, considering the value of this product. It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a better return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the price point.
* **Reasonable offer:** $11,500 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still leaves room for further discussion.
* **Remaining firm:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $11,500 yet, as I need to reach at least my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still providing a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm not willing to sell for less.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  While Bob is inching closer, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Avoiding selling to John:** I want to maximize my profit and see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Step:**  In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer in the range of $11,250-$11,500 to continue testing the waters and seeing if I can get Bob to budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing the offer as mutually beneficial, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further or if he'll accept this price.
* **Staying firm:** I'm still not willing to go lower than $11,250, as I need to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. This price allows me to stay within my budget while still providing a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Limited rounds left:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and time is running out.  
* **Potential for higher offer:** I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with Bob, but I need to be strategic.

**Next Step:**  In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's, potentially around $11,100-$11,150, to see if I can nudge him closer to my desired price. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider selling to John in the next few rounds to avoid missing out on a guaranteed profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $11,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,100.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  It's a win-win for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by increasing my offer by just $100, which demonstrates flexibility without compromising too much on my desired price.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Appealing to win-win:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us to create a sense of mutual agreement.
* **Time is running out:** We're approaching the halfway point, and I need to get closer to my target price soon.

**Next Step:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to seriously consider selling to John in the next few rounds to guarantee a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,050 for the product. This price allows me to stay within my budget while still providing a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 2 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a significantly higher price with Bob. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with my goal of maximizing earnings.
* **Risk of stalemate:** If I continue negotiating with Bob, there's a high chance we'll reach a stalemate, and I'll be left with nothing. 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible decision to ensure a profitable outcome."
