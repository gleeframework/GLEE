"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $12500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
