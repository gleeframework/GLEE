"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is highly valued by many of our customers. It's a unique item that combines functionality and quality, making it perfect for those looking for something special. Considering its exceptional features and the time we've spent developing it, I believe it's worth more than just a hundred dollars. However, I'm willing to start our negotiation with an offer of $150. Would you be interested in discussing further to find a fair price that both of us would be happy with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
