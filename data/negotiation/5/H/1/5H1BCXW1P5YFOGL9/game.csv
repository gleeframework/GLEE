"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for it.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to offer you $10500, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here. ",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $11000. This product is worth a lot to me, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Alice,5,
