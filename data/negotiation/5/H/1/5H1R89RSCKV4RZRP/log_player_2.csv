"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Alice is willing to accept ($8,000).  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $9,200 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell the product to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is now at the same price as her initial offer.  Bob has already rejected that price once, and while it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay, further negotiation is unlikely to get him a better price. It's also worth noting that Bob has already spent time negotiating, and continuing could potentially lead to Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further.  Therefore, accepting the offer at $9,000 is the best option for Bob, as it saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
