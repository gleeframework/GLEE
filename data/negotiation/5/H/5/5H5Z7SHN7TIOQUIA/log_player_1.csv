"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in exploring a more reasonable price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for proposing a counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial asking price. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm optimistic we can reach an agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is a fair price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,550,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to meet in the middle, which is a good sign he's willing to negotiate. I'm aiming to secure a price above $1,550,000. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to propose a counter-offer closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. I've given this some thought, and to demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm firm on this price. This might encourage Bob to accept, knowing there's little room for further negotiation.  I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,580,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still sticking to his pattern of meeting in the middle, and we are now getting very close. Accepting this offer secures a price significantly higher than my fallback option with John ($1,580,000 vs $1,200,000). It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him altogether."
