"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. I think that's a fair deal considering its value.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $750,000.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'm still a bit above $700,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,5,
