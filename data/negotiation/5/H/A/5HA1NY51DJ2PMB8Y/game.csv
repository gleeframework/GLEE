"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
