"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm looking for $10500.  This still gives you a good deal, and I think it's fair for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
