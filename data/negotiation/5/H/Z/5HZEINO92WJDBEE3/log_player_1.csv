Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,500,000 would be a fair price for the product given my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions.

Explanation:  Bob is firmly fixed at his $1,500,000 maximum offer.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Since John is offering the same amount, it makes the most sense to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
