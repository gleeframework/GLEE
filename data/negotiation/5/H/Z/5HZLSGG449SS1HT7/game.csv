"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000.",8250.0,Alice,5,
