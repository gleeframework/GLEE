"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance I can negotiate a better price, considering the product's worth significantly less to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer:

* **Starts significantly lower:**  This leaves room for negotiation while still being within my acceptable range.
* **Shows genuine interest:**  I don't want to lowball and risk offending Alice, potentially making her less willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still valuing the product closer to my maximum price than her own. I'll reject this offer and see if I can nudge her closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counter-offer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** A smaller increase demonstrates movement on my end. 
* **Aims for a middle ground:** This price is exactly halfway between our previous offers, encouraging a potential agreement. 
* **Still leaves room for negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Alice to counter if needed while staying within my acceptable budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While it's not the $7,500 I hoped for, $8,250 is a reasonable compromise. It saves me $1,750 compared to John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
