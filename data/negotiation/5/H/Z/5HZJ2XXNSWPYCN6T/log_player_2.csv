"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting strong. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price at this stage."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm not quite ready to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's no reason to accept a higher price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,200,000 is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, as it's still below its true value to me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll counteroffer $1,225,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your limit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  Here's why:

* **Alice is close, but not close enough:** While Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is tempting, it's still above Bob's ideal price. 
* **Time is ticking:** Bob only has 5 rounds left. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he risks losing out on the better deal from John. 
* **John is a safe bet:**  John has already offered a price that meets Bob's maximum limit, making him a reliable and secure option. 

It's better to secure the product at the desired price now than risk further negotiation and potentially miss out."
