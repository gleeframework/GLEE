"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? I'm genuinely interested in your product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  However, $90 is still a little too low for me.  Would you consider $92?  That's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.",92.0,Alice,5,
