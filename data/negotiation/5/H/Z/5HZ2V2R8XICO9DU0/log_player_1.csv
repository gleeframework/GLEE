{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals your willingness to negotiate while maintaining a good starting point for your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth trying to get closer to that figure by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? I'm genuinely interested in your product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit lower than you'd like. You can likely negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  However, $90 is still a little too low for me.  Would you consider $92?  That's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 92}
