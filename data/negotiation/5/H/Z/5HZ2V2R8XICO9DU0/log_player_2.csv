"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price. You can try to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer again. You're still able to get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. You can try to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price, but keep in mind that John is always an option if you can't get the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? I'm genuinely interested in your product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  However, $90 is still a little too low for me.  Would you consider $92?  That's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $80. 

Alice has come down slightly, but $92 is still above your target of $80. While you could continue negotiating, you know you can get the product for your desired price from John. There's no point in risking losing the product to someone else or spending more time negotiating when you already have a reliable alternative."
