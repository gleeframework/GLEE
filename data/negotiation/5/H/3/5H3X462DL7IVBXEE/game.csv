"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,100,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about compromise.  How about we go with $1,110,000? It's a small step closer to what I need, and it still represents a great deal for you. Let's get this done!",1110000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,095,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with this soon.",1095000.0,Bob,6,
