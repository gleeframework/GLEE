Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  Mentioning ""open to negotiation"" encourages Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation alive.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** By setting the initial price higher than what John is offering, I ensure that I'm getting a better deal if Bob accepts. 
* **If Bob rejects, I can then make a counteroffer based on his response.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $100.**  Selling to Bob for $90 would be a loss for me.
* **I can still get a better price from John.** John is willing to pay $100, which is more than Bob's offer.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.** I can use this opportunity to push for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a little profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing $95, I'm showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable value of $100. This is a reasonable counteroffer that could be appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting that the price is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not giving in completely to Bob's offer, keeping some leverage to potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $100.** I'm not willing to sell for a loss.
* **John's offer is significantly better than Bob's.**  John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is much closer to my desired value.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.**  Bob has been consistently pushing for a lower price, and it's unlikely he'll come closer to my target.

It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
