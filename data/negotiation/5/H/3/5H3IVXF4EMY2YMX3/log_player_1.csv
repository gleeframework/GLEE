"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?  I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding my position. I'm motivated to sell, so I can go as low as $14,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $14,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $14,500 mark. Accepting his offer now would mean losing out on a potential $1,750 profit.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
