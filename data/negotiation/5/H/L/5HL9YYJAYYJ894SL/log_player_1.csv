{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it!  I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  I also highlight the potential value of the product for him. 

I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider whether to counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to accept and make a quick sale,  I'm not willing to sell for so far below my minimum.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer. I want to see if I can push him closer to my price point.  If he continues to refuse, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $110. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone.  I'm also trying to reinforce the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already made a significant concession, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150. 

To maximize my earnings, I'm going to sell the product to John."
