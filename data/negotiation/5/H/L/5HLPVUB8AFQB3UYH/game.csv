"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to purchase it for $15000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $16500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $16500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $16000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
