{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $120, but it gives him some room to negotiate. It also leaves me some room to potentially lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still remaining above my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe $120 is still a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer of $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired goal. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
