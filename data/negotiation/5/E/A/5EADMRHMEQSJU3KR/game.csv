"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I can do $140, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. Would you consider selling it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I still need to make a profit. Is $135 a price you'd be comfortable with?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $130 and $135.",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can do $133, but that's as close to $135 as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132 and $135, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Is $133 a price you'd be willing to pay?",133.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $130 again? I'm willing to make a final offer and meet you in the middle one more time.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made a compromise at $133, Bob. I'm not willing to go back to $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to get at least $134 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",134.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway one more time, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $130. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",130.0,Bob,10,
