Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $1,300,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential gain of $200,000. This makes it more likely he'll accept.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, starting with a strong offer increases your chances of securing a deal that benefits both of you."
