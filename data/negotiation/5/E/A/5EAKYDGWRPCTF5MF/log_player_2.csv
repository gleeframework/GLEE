"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high considering her product's value to her is much lower. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has moved closer to a more reasonable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $7,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $6,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 6800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,800 is still a bit above your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $7,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close, but Alice saying this is her final offer could be a bluff. I'm willing to risk one more counter-offer to see if I can get the price down a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How does $7,000 sound?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm flattered that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $7,100. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and while I could try to push it down another $100, it's not worth the risk of her walking away. Accepting at $7,100 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000 price."
