"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.** 
* **Alice's offer is $9,500, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay ($10,000 is his maximum).**
* **Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John.** 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy for Bob to save money."
