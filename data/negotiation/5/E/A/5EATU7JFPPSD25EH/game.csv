"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range. Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the unique benefits this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but let's be realistic about the value this product brings. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made so far.  However, the gap between our valuations is still pretty wide.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 is a non-starter for me. I'd be willing to go to $750,000 if that would get us closer to a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible, but we're running out of room to make this work. I'm aware of other interested buyers, and to be frank, $750,000 is simply too far below its worth. My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
