"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $2,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $1,600,000 for it.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you say?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
