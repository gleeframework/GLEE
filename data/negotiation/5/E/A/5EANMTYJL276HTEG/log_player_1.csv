Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $175 is not too far off from my minimum value of $150, allowing for potential counteroffers without losing too much.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and engaging tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob by counteroffering. 
* **John is a backup:** While John is willing to pay $150, I'm not desperate to sell right now, so I can continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $140 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $175 and Bob's offer of $125. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the deal being ""great"" for Bob, focusing on the benefits he'll receive.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, making it a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $130 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $150, I'm not willing to sell for less.
* **John is a reliable option:** John is willing to pay my minimum price and provides a guaranteed sale.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further concessions and a lower price. It's better to secure the deal with John."
