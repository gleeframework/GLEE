"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I'm also aware that the product is worth less to Bob ($800,000), so I'm not starting too high to scare him off immediately.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible, but I'm also willing to walk away if it looks like I won't be able to reach a profitable agreement. I'll be monitoring Bob's reactions closely and adjusting my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), it's still significantly below my target.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob expressed a willingness to find a mutually beneficial price.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'll use the next round to counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm aiming to gradually move closer to a mutually acceptable price point while retaining a positive negotiating position."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset and me to receive a decent return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair"" price and a ""valuable asset"" to appeal to Bob's sense of value. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to find a sweet spot where Bob is likely to accept the offer without going too low on my end. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make further adjustments, but I'll also be considering selling to John as the negotiations continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), it's still slightly below it. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to meet in the middle.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a guaranteed profit, but I believe I can get closer to my target price if I keep negotiating with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll use the next round to counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  My goal is to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on. I'm willing to make concessions to secure a deal, but I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset, while still providing me with a reasonable return. It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer is exactly in the middle between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000).
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise that benefits both parties, hoping to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:** 

I believe this offer is a strong compromise. It's likely Bob will either accept or counter with a slightly higher price. If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options carefully and potentially sell to John. However, I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), but it's still a bit below it.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob has expressed a desire for a mutually beneficial price, he's also stated his maximum offer. It's unlikely he'll budge further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting further offers, potentially leading to a stalemate. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profitable outcome.

**Strategy:**

Considering the limited room for negotiation and the time pressure (only 4 rounds remaining), it's in my best interest to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John. This decision minimizes the risk of further negotiation and ensures a successful outcome."
