Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You earn $150,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to its actual value to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a little room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit even further."
