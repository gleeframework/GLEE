"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum desired price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a potential win for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **First round strategy:** I'm not aiming for a quick close in the first round. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. There's room for negotiation, and it's too early to settle for his initial offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm aware that selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'm willing to explore my options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This is a significant move, but still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $16,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Building towards an agreement:**  This counteroffer is aimed at finding a middle ground and setting the stage for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's still a $1,000 gap, and I'm confident I can convince Bob to go a little higher.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm aware that selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. I have several rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500.  This is a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and pressure:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a price point above my minimum.  This creates pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Emphasize value and urgency:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and expressing a desire to finalize the deal, suggesting this is the last chance for him to get a good price.
* **Final push:** This is a strategic move to try and close the deal within the next few rounds. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll likely move towards John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
* **Risk of a lower price:** If I keep negotiating, there's a chance Bob will continue to lowball me, and I might end up selling for less than $15,000.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and with the limited rounds left, it's the safest option to ensure I maximize my profit."
