"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll benefit from it. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer. However, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value meeting in the middle, $10,000 is still significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we agree on $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $12,000, but I need to see a significant drop from your last offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
