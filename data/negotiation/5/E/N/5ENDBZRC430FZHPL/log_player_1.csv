Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll benefit from it. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer. However, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value meeting in the middle, $10,000 is still significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we agree on $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $12,000, but I need to see a significant drop from your last offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
