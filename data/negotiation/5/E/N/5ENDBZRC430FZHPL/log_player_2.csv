"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no chance you'll accept it.  It's time to counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll benefit from it. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $18,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob is still very far away from his target of $8,000. It's crucial to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer. However, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value meeting in the middle, $10,000 is still significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we agree on $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $16,000 is still too high for Bob. He's determined to stay within his budget and knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John. Continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially lead to a better deal, but it's risky.  Bob should continue to counteroffer, but he needs to be prepared to walk away and buy from John if the price doesn't come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $12,000, but I need to see a significant drop from your last offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
