"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I think this is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $1000000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $800000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering its value to me is $1000000.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. I think this is the sweet spot where both of us can walk away happy. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
