Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" aiming to justify a higher price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a safety net."
