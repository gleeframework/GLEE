"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name] at a price of $2000000. This product is worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I understand you may have your own valuation, so please feel free to counteroffer. If we can't reach an agreement, I have another interested party lined up, but I'd prefer to see this go to someone who can truly appreciate its potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
