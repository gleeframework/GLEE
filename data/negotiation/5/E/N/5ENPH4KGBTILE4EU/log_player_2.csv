"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  While Bob could buy from John for $1,500,000, Alice is offering the product for $950,000. This saves Bob $550,000.
* **It's a win-win.** Alice is still getting a profit of $150,000 ($950,000 - $800,000), which is better than getting nothing if Bob buys from John. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
