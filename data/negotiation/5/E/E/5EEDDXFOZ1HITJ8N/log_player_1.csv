"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the product's value for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's still a good price for you, and it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below my ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control and potentially drive the price higher. 
* **John's Option:**  While $15,000 is the best possible outcome, I want to exhaust all options with Bob before resorting to selling to John.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my original offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet halfway. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but emphasize that it's still below my minimum threshold. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Midpoint Strategy:**  The $13,500 price represents a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm still open to further negotiation if necessary. 

This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer while remaining flexible for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That would be a fair compromise, and we could close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Ideal:** $13,000 is very close to my ideal price point of $13,500, representing a good compromise. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether or having to settle for a lower price.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are approaching the halfway point of our rounds, and I want to avoid the potential of running out of time. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good deal while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential lost opportunity."
