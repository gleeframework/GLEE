"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $12500 is a significant investment.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $12500 is just a bit below what I'm looking for at this stage. Would you be willing to consider $13500? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe the value of the product will make it a worthwhile investment for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12750. Can we meet at that price?",12750.0,Bob,4,
