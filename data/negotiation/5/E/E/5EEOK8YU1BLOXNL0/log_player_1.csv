"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is above your minimum value of $10,000. It allows some room for negotiation, but still gives you a strong initial position.
* **""Unique product"" and ""great value"":**  These are vague phrases that pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about the product. This is crucial for the negotiation process.
* **Asking for Bob's thoughts:** This opens the door for Bob to respond and begin the negotiation. 

It's important to remember that you're playing a strategic game here. By starting high, you create room to negotiate down while still maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is a good offer and above your minimum, it's still worth trying to get closer to your initial goal of $15,000. 

* **Rejecting the offer:**  This shows Bob that you're not desperate to sell and are willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:** This gives you a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.  

You've learned that Bob is interested in the product, but he's price-sensitive.  The next round will be crucial to assess his true willingness to pay and guide the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $12,500 is a significant investment.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $12,500 is just a bit below what I'm looking for at this stage. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe the value of the product will make it a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** This shows respect and helps build rapport.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  You're not completely shutting down his offer, but you're still trying to get closer to your desired price.
* **""Fair compromise"":**  Framing your counteroffer as a compromise suggests you're meeting him halfway, even if it's a smaller step than his.
* **Emphasize value:** You're subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits of the product, hoping to make him feel more comfortable with a slightly higher price. 

This counteroffer attempts to find a balance between pushing for a better price while maintaining a collaborative tone. It's a strategic move that keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12750. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to your initial offer of $15,000. We are now at a price that is significantly above your minimum of $10,000.  

* **Accepting the offer:** While you might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, it's a good time to close the deal.  There's a risk that continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.

This decision balances the need to maximize your profit with the potential for losing the deal altogether. It's a calculated risk based on the current state of the negotiation."
