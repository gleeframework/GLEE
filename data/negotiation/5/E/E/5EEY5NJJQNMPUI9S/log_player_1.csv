Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing flexibility:** By mentioning that I'm willing to negotiate for a fair price, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to a deal and that he might be able to get a better price.
* **Leaving room for John:**  This offer allows me to still sell to John for $150 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a better counteroffer:** I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer,  as Bob has shown interest in the product. 
* **John is always a backup:**  Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Closer to my minimum:**  $120 is closer to my minimum price of $150, but still leaves room for a potential deal with Bob.
* **Reiterate interest:**  I reiterate my interest in a deal to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum, but not enough:** Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further price concessions that would be detrimental to me. 
* **John is the safe choice:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a successful transaction."
