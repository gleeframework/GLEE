"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1400000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1700000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Can you consider $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
