"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While $15,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $13,500 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $12,750 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could let it go for $13,000, but that's absolutely as low as I can go.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,000 is your bottom line, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $12,800, which is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",12800.0,Bob,6,
