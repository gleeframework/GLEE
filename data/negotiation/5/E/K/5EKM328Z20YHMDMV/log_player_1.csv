Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford it at $1,300,000. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I can only consider offers within the $800,000 range. Would it be possible for us to meet closer to my maximum offer of $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge from the $850,000 range. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I'm comfortable with, especially knowing I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
