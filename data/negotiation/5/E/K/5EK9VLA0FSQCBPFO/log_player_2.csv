"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. There's no reason to pay $2,000 more than you need to. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with your backup plan and maximize your savings."
