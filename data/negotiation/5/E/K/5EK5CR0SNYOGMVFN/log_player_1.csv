I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still potentially attractive to Bob if he values the product higher. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell it to John for $120, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a higher price."
