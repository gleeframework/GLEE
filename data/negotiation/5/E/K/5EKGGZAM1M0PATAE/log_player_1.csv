"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the product's potential, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To start negotiations, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price considering my needs and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for providing yours. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position but $1,900,000 remains outside of my budget. To demonstrate my seriousness about this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're still below John's offer and significantly below our desired price. It's worth pushing Bob further, but we need to start moving towards a more realistic price point to avoid a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer represents a substantial decrease, signaling to Bob that we're serious about closing a deal. However, it remains significantly above his current offer, leaving room for further negotiation while staying above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  To find common ground, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This demonstrates my strong interest in this product and represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now above John's offer.  While we could try to push for a bit more, the difference is relatively small now and accepting ensures we close the deal without risking further negotiation."
