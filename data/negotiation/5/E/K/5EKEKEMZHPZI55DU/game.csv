"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $825,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",785000.0,Bob,6,
