"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
