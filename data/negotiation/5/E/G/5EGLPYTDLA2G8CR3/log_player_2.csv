"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, you can potentially do better. Since you value the product at $15,000, you have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $12,000 but still higher than her value of $8,000. This gives Alice a good incentive to accept, and it leaves me with a substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is only slightly better than her previous offer of $12,000. It's still within my negotiation range, and I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It's a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a successful agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's risky and could potentially lead to Alice rejecting my offer and leaving me with no option but to buy from John. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
