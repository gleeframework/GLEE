Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $875,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's clear that his upper limit is significantly lower than my own valuation.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price from Bob, but it's unlikely to reach the $1,000,000 John is already offering. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
