"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Buying from Alice for $10,000 saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John for $12,000.
* **Alice gets a good deal:** Even though Alice values the product at $8,000, she still makes a profit of $2,000 by selling it to Bob for $10,000. 

This scenario is a win-win for both Bob and Alice."
