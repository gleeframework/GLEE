"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than the price you'd pay for the product from John ($1,500,000).  This means accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000, even though it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice."
