"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your valuation, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $900,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering our respective valuations.  Let me know if you're open to this.",900000.0,Alice,3,
