Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $100. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a price you'd accept. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, mentions the product's value, and positions the price as fair. 
 
**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You make a $40 profit, which is better than the guaranteed $0 if you went directly to John.
* **Bob negotiates:**  He might counter-offer, opening up a negotiation where you can still potentially settle above your minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** You haven't lost anything and can proceed to sell to John for your guaranteed $150."
