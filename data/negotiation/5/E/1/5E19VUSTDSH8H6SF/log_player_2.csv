"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($10,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also close to Alice's perceived value of the product, increasing the likelihood that she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $11,500 represents a fair price for the value this product offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  Bob can likely get a lower price if he continues to negotiate.  It's also worth noting that Bob has only used one counteroffer so far, and he has plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,750 at this point.  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, demonstrating to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to be reasonable. It's also closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.  It's still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
