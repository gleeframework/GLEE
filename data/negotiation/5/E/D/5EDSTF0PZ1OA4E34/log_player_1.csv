{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,000,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Factor:**  By mentioning it's a ""great deal for both of us"", I'm subtly implying that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being pressured into accepting a price he's not comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on his proposed price and how much I'm willing to lower my price. 
* I'll be keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option, as I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target, but still leaving some room for compromise.
* **John's offer is the safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price somewhere between $850,000 and $1,000,000, aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll assess his next offer and continue to negotiate until I reach a price I'm comfortable with or until I decide it's more profitable to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $950,000 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as ""fair"" to both of us, highlighting that I'm willing to be flexible while still protecting my interests. 
* **Open for Further Discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for more negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion and suggesting that we can find a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he accepts, I've secured a decent deal. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. 
* **Remember John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as my safety net if the negotiation with Bob becomes too time-consuming or if he won't budge on his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my previous offer of $950,000, and it's significantly higher than his previous offer of $850,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further may take additional time and effort, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to secure a significantly better price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While I'd ideally like to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Complete the transaction:** I'll move forward with the sale to Bob at $900,000, as this represents a good deal for me considering the potential time and effort involved in further negotiation. 
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  While I've accepted Bob's offer, I'll remember that John is still a potential buyer for the future if I have similar products to sell."
