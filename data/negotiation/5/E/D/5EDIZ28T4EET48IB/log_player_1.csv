"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I've been quoted by another seller. Can you meet me at that price or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another offer, but this product is unique and I'm confident you'll find it worth more than $80.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I've done some research and found similar products in the market for around $100. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product without further negotiation and avoids the risk of further rejections or a longer negotiation process.  While I could potentially get a higher price with more negotiation, there's no guarantee.  The offer from John is also $100, so there's no additional benefit to selling to him."
