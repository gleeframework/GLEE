Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary. However, I'm also mindful of John's offer, so I don't want to price myself out of the market."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I could sell to John for $8,000, I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. It's now below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I'll take John's offer of $8,000 to ensure I get a price that's at least my minimum."
