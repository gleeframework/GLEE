"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, right? I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. That's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is framed as a ""good deal,"" you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door to getting a better price."
