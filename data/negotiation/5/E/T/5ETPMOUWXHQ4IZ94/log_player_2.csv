Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant benefits this product offers, while also being more within your reach.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.
