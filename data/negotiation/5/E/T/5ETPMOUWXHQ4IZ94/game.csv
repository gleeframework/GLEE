"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my current financial situation and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I am willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant benefits this product offers, while also being more within your reach.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline at $1,050,000. Given my budgetary constraints, I am only able to consider offers closer to $900,000. I am willing to propose $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to move forward in a mutually beneficial way.",950000.0,Bob,4,
