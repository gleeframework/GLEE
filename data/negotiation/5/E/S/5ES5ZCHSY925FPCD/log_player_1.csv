Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm aware this might be too high and could lead to a rejection. I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than what Bob initially offered, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable considering my minimum price. I hope this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, as I'm willing to sell at this price to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further time and effort."
