"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. How about $130? I'm willing to compromise to make this work for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $127? I'm really interested in the product and I think we're close.",127.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but $127 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $128? It's a fair price for both of us.",128.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. Would you be willing to meet me at $126? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",126.0,Bob,6,
