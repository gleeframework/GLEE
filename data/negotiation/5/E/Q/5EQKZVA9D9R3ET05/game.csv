I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?,120.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,115.0
"I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50",112.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,112.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to go below $112. I can do $111.50 for you, though",111.5,Alice,5,,
