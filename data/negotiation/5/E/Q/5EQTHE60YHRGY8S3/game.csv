"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $675,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while respecting its value.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're serious about the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I understand that you're making compromises, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference and settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $700,000, which would be $712,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",712500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I know you said your last offer was final, I'm hoping we can close the gap.  Would you consider $706,000?  I'm very interested in the product and this is my final offer.",706000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $706,000. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $715,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",715000.0,Alice,9,
