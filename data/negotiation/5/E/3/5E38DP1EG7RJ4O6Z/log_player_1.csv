Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Secure a Sale:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $90 is still more profitable than selling to John for $100."
