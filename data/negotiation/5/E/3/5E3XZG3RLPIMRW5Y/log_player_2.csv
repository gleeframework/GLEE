"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While $15,000 is your maximum, you'd prefer to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's $12,000, showing you're serious about getting a good deal. It's still within your budget, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects it, you can adjust your offer in the following rounds.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 9 rounds left, so there's time to see how far you can push the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 8 rounds left, and by rejecting Alice's offer, you show that you are committed to getting a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice for as long as possible, as you could potentially get a better price than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-point compromise:** This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's offer of $13,000. It shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a good deal.
* **Building momentum:**  By progressively increasing your offer, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're not going to be taken advantage of.
* **Time is still on your side:** You have 7 rounds left, so you can continue to refine your offer and see if you can push Alice further."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still a significant amount above your ideal price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have 6 rounds left, and by rejecting Alice's offer, you're showing your commitment to getting a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  You're only halfway through the negotiation process, and there's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price but still pushing for a better deal.
* **Balancing the Pressure:**  Alice has been stubborn, but I'm also not giving up. A slight increase shows I'm serious but also not willing to accept her last offer.
* **Time is running out:**  We're halfway through the negotiations. If I can't get a better price in the next few rounds, buying from John might be the only option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high.** While $14,000 is only $1,000 away from John's price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. 
* **Time is running out, but there's still hope.** I have 3 rounds left, and Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. I can try to push for a lower price in the next round.
* **Buying from John is still the worst-case scenario.** It's better to try and negotiate with Alice for as long as possible, as I could potentially get a better price than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  This is my final offer, and it's a significant increase from my previous offer.  
* **Balancing risk:**  While it's closer to Alice's offer, it's still below her current $14,000 offer, and it's also within my budget.
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiations. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely have to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.** This is the last round before I have to buy from John.
* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's only $500 less than John's price, and there's not enough time to negotiate further.
* **Minimizing losses:** Buying from John is not ideal, but it's the best option at this point to ensure I get the product. 

Even though I could try to make one final counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting it and being left with nothing is too high.  It's more strategic to secure the product from John now, even at a slightly higher price, than to risk being left empty-handed."
