"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product is worth more than $950,000, I'm willing to compromise to ensure a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but also reflects the value I see in this product for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
