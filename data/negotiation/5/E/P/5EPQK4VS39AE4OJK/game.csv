"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $13,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $14,500 is close, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this to make sense. That's already a significant discount from my initial asking price.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
