"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'd need a lower price to make it work for my business. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm pleased to counter your offer with a proposal of $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects a middle ground between our initial prices, aiming to bring us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement while still respecting the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $1,290,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from your last offer, aiming to find a balance that respects the product's value while considering your budget constraints.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still aiming for $1,200,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
