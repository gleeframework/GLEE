"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits for Bob (""great deal"", ""value to you"") to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not aiming for the full $1,500,000 in the first round. This gives Bob a reason to negotiate and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **10 rounds remain:**  I have plenty of time to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to maximize my profit.  Negotiating with Bob could potentially yield a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price still gives you a great deal, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying within the 10-round limit:** I'm keeping the negotiations moving forward, but I'm also being firm with my minimum price.

* **Time is on my side:** I still have 6 rounds left to reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.
