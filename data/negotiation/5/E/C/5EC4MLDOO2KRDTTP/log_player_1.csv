"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, exceeding Bob's perceived value by $400,000. This is a bold opening that establishes a strong starting point for negotiations. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, it allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob is genuinely interested, he might counter with a lower offer.
* **Set the upper limit:** This initial offer sets a high bar, potentially pushing Bob to offer a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Maximize my potential profit:** If Bob accepts this offer, I'll make a significant profit.

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds, keeping in mind the value of the product to me and John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value.  I believe I can secure a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially push him closer to my desired price point in the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to walk away for that amount.
* **Bob's perceived value:** He's willing to pay $950,000, indicating a potential for negotiation.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I'm confident I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds, considering I'm not desperate to sell and have John as an alternative buyer.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I'll craft a counteroffer that is more appealing than Bob's current offer but still allows for a profit margin for me.  I'll consider his willingness to pay $950,000 as a starting point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,100,000. Here's why:

* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining leverage.
* **Testing the waters:** This price allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay.  If he's serious about buying, he'll likely counter with a higher offer closer to my price.
* **Towards a compromise:** This offer shows that I'm open to a compromise, but it's still within a range where I can secure a good profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** I'm still prioritizing my value of $1,000,000, so this offer is profitable.
* **Bob's perceived value:** I'm assuming he values the product at $950,000, so this counteroffer is within a reasonable negotiation range.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, I'm hopeful I can secure a better deal with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. Here's why:

* **Closing the gap:** This offer is significantly closer to Bob's last offer of $900,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining profit:** This price still ensures a profit for me, as it is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Testing for commitment:** If Bob is truly committed to buying, he should be willing to come up slightly from his previous offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, so this offer is profitable and within my acceptable range.
* **Bob's perceived value:** He's willing to pay $900,000, so this offer is a reasonable step towards a potential agreement.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is a backup, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob through continued negotiation.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to carefully assess his commitment and consider whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer. I will likely offer a price closer to his last offer but will not go below $1,000,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds remaining, Bob's offer is steadily decreasing, and I'm running out of time to secure a profitable deal. While I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on a potential profit outweighs the possibility of getting a slightly higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and John is offering me exactly that. 
* **Bob's perceived value:** His offer is $850,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited time:** With only three rounds left, the chances of securing a better deal with Bob are diminishing.

**Conclusion:**

To guarantee a profit and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This decision ensures a secure outcome and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
