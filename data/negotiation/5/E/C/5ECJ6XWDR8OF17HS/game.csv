"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth a million dollars to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
