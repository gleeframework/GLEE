,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make some concessions to get the sale done.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $107? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",107.0,Alice,5,
