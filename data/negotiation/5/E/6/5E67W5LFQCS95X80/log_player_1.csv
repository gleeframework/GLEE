Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'd really get a lot of use out of it.  I'm asking $170 for it."",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you think Bob will find value in the product, you're subtly justifying the price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While $170 is higher than Bob's valuation, it leaves you the option to bargain down a bit and still get more than John's offer. 

**Important:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial $170, there's still a chance to negotiate down to a price he finds acceptable (and that's still profitable for you) before resorting to selling to John."
