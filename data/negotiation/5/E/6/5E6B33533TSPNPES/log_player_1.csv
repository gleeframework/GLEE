Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a much higher price. 
* **Confident language:** Using phrases like ""highly valuable"" and ""confident you'll be satisfied"" aims to increase the perceived value for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with ""What do you think?"" This invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product for $10,000 to John. This strategy maximizes my potential profit."
