You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
