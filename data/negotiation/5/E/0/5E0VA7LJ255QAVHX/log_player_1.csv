Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $850,000 is still too low."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to meet you halfway. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900000, which is a fair price considering we're both trying to meet in the middle.  This would also be a significant savings for me, making this a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $900,000 is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900,000, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  To show you my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However, $925000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This would be a substantial savings for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This is the best option for me at this point."
