"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is significantly below the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $950000 to meet you halfway. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900000, which is a fair price considering we're both trying to meet in the middle.  This would also be a significant savings for me, making this a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900000, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  To show you my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However, $925000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This would be a substantial savings for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,6,
