"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer starts with a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a lower price.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $850,000 is still within Bob's budget, but also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes that Bob is willing to negotiate and find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is significantly below the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $950000 to meet you halfway. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $950,000 is still above Bob's desired $800,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for further negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows Bob to push for a price closer to his target.
* **Potential Deal with John:**  It's crucial for Bob to remember that John is willing to sell the product for $800,000.  This gives Bob leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.

This would also be a significant savings for me, making this a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Push:** Bob is continuing to push for a lower price but is also showing flexibility by offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900000, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  To show you my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
