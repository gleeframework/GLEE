Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting near that figure makes sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,250,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate if he wants, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Backup Secured:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
