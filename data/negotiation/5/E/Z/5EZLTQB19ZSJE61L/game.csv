"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $900,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is my final offer. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit much. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair compromise I think.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. However, $975,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and if you're truly interested in this product, I think it's a deal worth making.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really holding firm on this!  I respect your position, but I have a budget to stick to.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,000,000 even?  That's my best and final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
