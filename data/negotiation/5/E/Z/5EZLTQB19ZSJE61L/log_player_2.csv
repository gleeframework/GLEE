"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is my final offer. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer. However, $975,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and if you're truly interested in this product, I think it's a deal worth making.
