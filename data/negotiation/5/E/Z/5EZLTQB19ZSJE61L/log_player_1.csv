Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $900,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is my final offer. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit much. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair compromise I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob, but if he doesn't budge, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. However, $975,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and if you're truly interested in this product, I think it's a deal worth making."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really holding firm on this!  I respect your position, but I have a budget to stick to.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,000,000 even?  That's my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
