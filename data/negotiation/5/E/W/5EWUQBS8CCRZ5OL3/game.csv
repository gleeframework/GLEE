"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's meet in the middle!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to accept $940,000. This price feels fair for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,
