"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value and desirability of the product, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum price of $120 to give myself room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in negotiations and allows me to be more assertive with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to Bob's price:** This counter-offer moves closer to Bob's price while still being above my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and deal nature of the price, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** By saying ""Let me know if you're interested"" I'm leaving the door open for further negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90. That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it right away.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for improvement:** I can likely get a better price with further negotiation, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to pay higher than his initial offer.
* **John's offer is a good safety net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $120 from John gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $92? That's closer to your offer, and still a fair price for the value of this product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit. 
* **Call to action:** I'm urging Bob to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to pay $88. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While Bob's offers are getting closer, there's still room to negotiate.
* **John's offer provides leverage:** I can be more confident in rejecting Bob's offers, knowing I have a guaranteed $120 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $88 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway, which shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing this price as ""fair"" for both parties, emphasizing the mutual benefit of closing the deal.
* **Call to action:**  I'm again urging Bob to close the deal, making it clear I'm ready to finalize the transaction.

**Important Note:**  While $90 is still below my minimum, I'm starting to run out of rounds. I need to find a balance between getting as much money as possible and ensuring I don't lose the deal altogether.  The offer of $90 is a good compromise, as it's only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price."
