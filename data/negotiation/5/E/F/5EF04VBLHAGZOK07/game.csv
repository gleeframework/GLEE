"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your company.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the significant ROI this product will bring.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
