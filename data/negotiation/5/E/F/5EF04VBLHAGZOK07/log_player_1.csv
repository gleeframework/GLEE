Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to your company. Given your expertise in this field, I'm confident it would be a great asset. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise while still giving me a significant profit.
* **Confidence in Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and his expertise in the field, subtly suggesting it's worth more to him than the price I'm offering.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation with the phrase ""Let me know what you think!"" 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation while still leaving space for negotiation.
* **Maintain Control:**  I'm not immediately revealing my bottom line, leaving room to adjust my position based on Bob's response.
* **Prepare for Counteroffers:**  This approach allows me to potentially counter Bob's offer if it's too low, leading to a more favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price point.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I can control the negotiation process and potentially drive the price higher. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price point, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your company.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the significant ROI this product will bring.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $1,175,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential ROI for his company, subtly pushing him towards a higher price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  The message ends with ""What do you think?""  leaving room for Bob to counter again if needed. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:**  I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward and demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Increase the Price:**  I'm pushing the price closer to my desired range while still being reasonable.
* **Set the Stage for a Final Agreement:**  This counteroffer is likely to either be accepted by Bob or lead to a final counteroffer that I can either accept or reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Further negotiation is likely to result in small price adjustments, not a significant increase.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate would require more effort and might not lead to a significantly better outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a profitable deal without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
