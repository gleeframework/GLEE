"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $900,000. It's a good price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
