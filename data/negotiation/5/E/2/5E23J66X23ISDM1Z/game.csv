"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. $200 might have been a bit high, but $120 is quite low for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly interested in this product, and I want to make a deal. $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150 final offer. This is a great price for the value you're getting.",150.0,Alice,5,
