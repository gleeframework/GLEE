Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, and you value it at $1,500,000 minimum.  A price of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially profit if he finds the product more valuable later, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Strong Initial Offer:**  Starting with a strong offer can anchor the negotiation and potentially lead to a quicker deal."
