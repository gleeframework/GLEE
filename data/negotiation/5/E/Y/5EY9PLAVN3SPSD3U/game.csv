"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
