"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than John's:**  $12,500 is a better price for Bob than John's $15,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500 was rejected. It's unlikely that Alice will go much lower.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with the only option of buying from John at a higher price. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
