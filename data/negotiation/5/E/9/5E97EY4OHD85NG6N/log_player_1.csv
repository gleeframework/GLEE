"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values it at $120, there's likely to be some wiggle room. I'm also using positive language to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $120. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I'm still looking for the best deal, and I'd like to propose $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to $100, $90 is a good price.  I've already rejected two of his offers, and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely.  The remaining rounds are a risk, and $90 is a solid profit for me."
