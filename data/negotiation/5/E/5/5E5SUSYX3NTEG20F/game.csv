"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $725,000. Let me know if that works for you.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
