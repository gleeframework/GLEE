{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value. This allows for negotiation room while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Value-based Argument:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob can help him see the potential benefits of accepting the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've achieved my goal of selling the product for a good price.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter-offer again.
* **If Negotiations Stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $850,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob to potentially earn more.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to compromise.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.

* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for further negotiation, suggesting that I'm flexible and willing to continue discussing. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider whether to counteroffer again or sell to John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $885,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
