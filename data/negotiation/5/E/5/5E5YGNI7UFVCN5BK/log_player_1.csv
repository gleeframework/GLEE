{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who values the product at $150.  It's also a fairly standard opening offer to start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than $80, I'm aiming for a higher price given Bob's initial valuation. I'll try to meet him halfway with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I can't quite go down to $100, I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  How about $110?  This still allows me to make a good profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still looking to stay within $100. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer. Accepting $105 is still a good profit for me, and it's likely Bob won't budge further. It's better to secure the sale than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for a much lower price."
