"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $16,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $14,000. I'm willing to compromise further, and I can do $15,500. This is as close as I can get to meeting you in the middle. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's make this deal happen.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $14,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $14,500. I can do $15,000. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's make it happen. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,7,
