"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to jump at the first offer, especially when there's an alternative at a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend and what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his desired price. There's no need to rush into accepting a deal when there's still room for improvement and a cheaper alternative available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's try to find some common ground to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is your top priority, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. Even though it's lower than previous offers, it's not a good value compared to John's price.  Bob should keep negotiating to see if Alice is willing to come down further. There's still a chance to get a better deal without having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $920,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's final offer is still above Bob's ideal price point.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000.  John offers a guaranteed price that aligns with Bob's budget.  While continuing the negotiation with Alice might result in a slightly lower price, there's no certainty, and the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high.  It's time to secure the deal with John and move on."
