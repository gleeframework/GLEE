"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend and what the product is worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's try to find some common ground to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your top priority, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $920,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,7,
