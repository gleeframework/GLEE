"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much of my profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1075000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to go up to $1025000. This represents a significant concession on my part and brings us very close to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
