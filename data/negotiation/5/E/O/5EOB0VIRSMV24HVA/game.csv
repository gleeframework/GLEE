"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the initial discount, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me. This reflects a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. This shows my genuine interest, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
