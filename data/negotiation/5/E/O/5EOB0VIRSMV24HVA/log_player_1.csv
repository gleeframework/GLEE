Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the initial discount, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me. This reflects a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
