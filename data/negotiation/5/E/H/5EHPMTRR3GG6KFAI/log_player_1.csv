Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $70 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $80. I'll try to counter with a price that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $85, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $77.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $77.50 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $80 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $77.50 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82.50.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $79. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $79 is only $1 less than what John is offering. Since this is close to my minimum acceptable price and we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I'll accept his offer."
