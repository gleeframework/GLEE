"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. Given its value to you, I believe this is a fair and attractive price. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is more than Alice values the product for, it's still less than your $150 maximum and the $150 John would charge. Accepting this offer saves you money."
