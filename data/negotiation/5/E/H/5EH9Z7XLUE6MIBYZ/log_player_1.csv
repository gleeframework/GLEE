""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm offering it at this price before considering other buyers."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than her own valuation but high enough that Bob might consider it a good deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will pay $15,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing Alice to confidently aim high with Bob.
* **Psychological Pricing:** Offering the product just below the $15,000 mark might make Bob perceive it as a significant discount and a better deal than it actually is. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice needs to decide her lowest acceptable price beforehand."
