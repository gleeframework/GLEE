"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for a product like this. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,500, reflecting the value of the product and our potential for a good business relationship.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to continue exploring a deal, $9,250 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with.  To show you I'm serious about finding common ground, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,375.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we keep working together.",9375.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
