Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still allows me to make a profit. This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, and if he rejects, I can still make a decent profit by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $110? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I can still try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $117.50? I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $117.50 is still a bit steep.  How about $115? I'm really keen on this product and think we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $115 is a little lower than I initially hoped for, it's still a good profit for me and a better deal than selling to John.  It's also likely that continuing to negotiate won't get me much more, and I risk Bob walking away completely."
