{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a special price of $14,999. I believe it offers significant value at this price, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, she should aim for a price slightly below that to entice Bob.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $14,999 creates a sense of urgency and appears more appealing than a round $15,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is close to Alice's minimum, there's a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy balances securing a good profit with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
