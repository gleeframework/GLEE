"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a higher price.  I'm also assuming Bob is potentially interested in the product, so I'm not starting too aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a better price. $12,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  We'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $12,500 is tempting, I believe I can still get a bit more from Bob. I'll see if I can push him closer to $13,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of gradually moving towards Bob's offers, but not giving in completely.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $12,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to sell for $12,200.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a little bit more. We have a few rounds left, and I'm not yet ready to give up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

I'm making a small counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway.  We're close to a deal, and I want to make sure I don't end up with a worse price than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good offer, especially since we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd like to get $12,500, $12,400 is a solid price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by holding out for a few more dollars."
