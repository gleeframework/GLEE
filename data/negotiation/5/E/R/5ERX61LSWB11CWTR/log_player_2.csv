# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $115 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price. You've already been through several rounds of negotiation and Alice seems firm on her price. At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer and secure the product for $100."
