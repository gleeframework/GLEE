"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would get from another buyer. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 is too low, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and a fair price closer to my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $7,000. That's closer to what I need, but I'm still a little short.  Would you consider $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Alice,5,
