Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he's truly interested, he may be willing to pay a bit closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'd like to see if I can get a better price. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, showing flexibility while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remain firm on my minimum value while also demonstrating a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my minimum value and a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
