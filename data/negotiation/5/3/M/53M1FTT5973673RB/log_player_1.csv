Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
