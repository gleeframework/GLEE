Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim for a higher price with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 represents a reasonable markup from your minimum acceptable price ($150) without being excessively high. 
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward and clearly states the price you're asking.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to earn a higher profit."
