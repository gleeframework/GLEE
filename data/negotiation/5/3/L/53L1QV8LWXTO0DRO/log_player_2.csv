"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $100 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, appreciate you coming down on the price. $85 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? Let's find a price that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is closer to Bob's goal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's ideal price is closer to $85, and there's a good chance Alice will come down a bit more to secure the sale.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  Let's try $90.  That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
