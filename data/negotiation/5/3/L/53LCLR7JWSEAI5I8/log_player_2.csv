"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject the offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $2,250,000, which is too high. I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
