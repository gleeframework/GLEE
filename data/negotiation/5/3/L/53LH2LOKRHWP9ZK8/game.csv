"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $700000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above your target price. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $722500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",722500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $722500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $710000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",710000.0,Bob,6,
