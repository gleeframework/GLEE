Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above your target price of $800,000. It's better to negotiate further and try to get a lower price. There are 9 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to find a mutually acceptable deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above your target price. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $725000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $722500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $722,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated that $722,500 is her lowest price, but it's still above your target value. With five rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation.  You can continue to counter-offer and try to push for a lower price.  While you risk losing the deal, you can potentially save a significant amount of money by continuing to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $722,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $710,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 710000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $725000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $723000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $723,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $723,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of time and Alice is still very firm on her price.  Although $723,000 is a good price, it's still above your target value.  Buying from John at $800,000, while not ideal, ensures you get the product and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not lead to a better price.  It's important to balance the desire to get a lower price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
