"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely try to get a better price by negotiating.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $10,000 limit.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite and explains that the initial offer doesn't work for us, but we're still interested. This keeps the negotiation going in a positive direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice came down in price, she's still above our $10,000 limit. We have time and should try to meet closer to the middle.
* **John is our Backup:**  We have the safety net of John's offer, so there's no pressure to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That's a significant step up from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, demonstrating willingness to compromise. By suggesting a midpoint between our previous offer and her current one ($9,000 and $10,500), we're aiming for a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Show Commitment:** The message highlights that we've increased our offer significantly, emphasizing our genuine interest in the product and our desire to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a product you value while I get a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to John's Offer:** Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but at $10,250, we're only saving $250 compared to John's offer of $10,000. It's worth seeing if we can get Alice's price down further with a few more rounds.
* **Negotiating Leverage:**  We still have several rounds left and Alice is clearly engaged in the negotiation. This suggests we still have leverage to potentially secure a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $10,000 even?  It's a win-win - I get the product at a price I can afford, and you get a quick sale."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're now matching John's offer. This is our bottom line. 
* **Highlighting Benefits:** The message focuses on the benefits for Alice: a quick sale and a guaranteed price. This can be persuasive in closing the deal.
* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. This offer adds a subtle time pressure for Alice to accept."
