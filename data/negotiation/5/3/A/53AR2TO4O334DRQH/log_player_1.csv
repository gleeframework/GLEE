Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150.  I'm open to counteroffers, but I'll also keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that right away.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. It's a compromise between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement without having to go through too many more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is only $10 less than my last offer.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's still above my minimum and will allow me to move on to other opportunities."
