"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can close the deal now.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This feels like a fair compromise, given we're both trying to find common ground. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $9,900.  This is a very fair offer, considering we are both close to finding common ground.  Let's close this deal!",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. $9,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. My final offer is $9,750.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering how close we are.  Let's close this deal!",9750.0,Bob,8,
