"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a significant opportunity, as I know similar products have sold for much higher. If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I'm confident I can find another buyer who will appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
