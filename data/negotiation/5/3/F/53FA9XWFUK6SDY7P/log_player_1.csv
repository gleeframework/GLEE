"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This ""anchors"" the negotiation high and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to justify the high asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and open to discussion, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering my needs and the potential of the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my valuation, $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer and acknowledges the value you see in it."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about finding an agreement. 
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the price reduction as a strategic move to reach a mutually beneficial deal, not a desperate one.
* **Holding Firm (for now):** I'm still well above Bob's offer and my minimum. I want to see how he responds before making further concessions. I'm keeping John as a backup plan if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs and the product's potential.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer!  Bob is moving steadily upward, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'll make one more strategic concession before considering John's offer more seriously. I need to signal that I'm nearing my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to add pressure and signal I'm serious about my limit. 
* **Mentioning John:** I'm subtly introducing the alternative buyer (John) to create a sense of urgency and competition, without revealing the full details of John's offer.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding slightly above my absolute minimum ($1,000,000) to leave a small margin, but the tone remains collaborative and emphasizes fairness. 

This is a pivotal point in the negotiation. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering our respective needs and the product's potential. Let's close this deal.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob is unlikely to reach my $1,000,000 minimum. His latest offer of $950,000 confirms this.  
* **John is the Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. There's no point in risking a lower price with Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further with little chance of a significant increase from Bob is not worth the potential loss of time. 

It's been a good negotiation, but sometimes a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I'll proceed with selling the product to John."
