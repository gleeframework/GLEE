Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've put into this product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it but would need to bring the price down to $10,000 to make it work for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum budget of $10,000.  He's being polite but firm in his counteroffer. This is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10000 is significantly below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13000?  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his budget but also shows a willingness to compromise. He's aiming for a price that is still within his acceptable range, while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but how about $12500?  I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and your budget. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's a good sign that Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, but this time, he's emphasizing that this is his absolute highest offer.  He's trying to create a sense of urgency and get Alice to accept his offer. The price of $11,000 is still within his acceptable range, but it's getting close to his maximum budget."
