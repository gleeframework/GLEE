"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value and potential. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've put into this product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it but would need to bring the price down to $10000 to make it work for me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10000 is significantly below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13000?  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but how about $12500?  I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and your budget. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.",11000.0,Bob,6,
