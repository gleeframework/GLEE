Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll aim to get a good profit margin. I'll offer the product to Bob at a price of $15,000.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $12,000. Since this is the minimum value the product has to him, I'll decide to sell the product to Bob for $12,000. I'll choose option (1) and accept his offer.
