"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's still within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's always wise to start by rejecting the initial offer to see if you can push for a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's still above your maximum value, but leaves room for potential concessions from Alice.  This strategy aims to quickly move the negotiation closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal. It's important to remember that I can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small but meaningful step closer to Alice's offer while still being significantly lower than her last proposal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $1,090,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm confident that I can push for a better price with a counteroffer. I also want to see if Alice is genuinely interested in making a deal or just trying to stall for time. By rejecting her offer and sending a counteroffer, I can gauge her level of interest and potentially negotiate a lower price.  Remember, I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a deal that's not favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,080,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and my desired price. It demonstrates that I am willing to be flexible but also that I am not willing to pay more than $1,080,000. This strategy aims to incentivize Alice to accept the offer, as it's closer to her previous proposal and might be the best outcome she can achieve without risking the deal completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. How about we close the deal at $1,085,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is getting closer, but I'm still determined to try and secure a lower price. I've already rejected her offer at $1,090,000, so there's room for her to come down further. It's important to remember that I can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept this offer. I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can reach a better agreement."

With only a few rounds remaining, this strategy aims to incentivize Alice to accept and close the deal, as the gap between our offers is narrowing."
