"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at no less than $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $2000000.  I believe it holds significant potential for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, you have a clear benchmark for a good deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go that low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point. You have a clear benchmark with John's offer of $1,000,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to your desired range."
