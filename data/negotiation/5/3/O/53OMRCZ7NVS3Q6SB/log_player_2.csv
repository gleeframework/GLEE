"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $12500.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is offering it for $12,500. This is a $2,500 savings compared to buying from John.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** While Alice's offer is good, you can always try to negotiate a lower price. However, since her offer is already good, accepting is a safe option."
