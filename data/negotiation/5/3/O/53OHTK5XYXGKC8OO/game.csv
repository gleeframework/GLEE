"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd find it incredibly valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,750 is still a bit low.  How about $10,250?  That's a reasonable middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. How about we try $9,900? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,900. However, I'm still just a little short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to accept $10,100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider it.",9800.0,Bob,8,
