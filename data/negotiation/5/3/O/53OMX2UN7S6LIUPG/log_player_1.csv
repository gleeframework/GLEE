Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the message in a friendly and encouraging way to make Bob more receptive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiating the price, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I've hinted at the product's value, without explicitly stating it, to pique Bob's interest.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter with a lower price, or walk away and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:**  There's no potential to get a higher price from Bob, as his offer is already at my floor. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves me time and effort in further negotiation, which might not yield a better outcome. 

**Conclusion:**  It's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at my minimum price point."
