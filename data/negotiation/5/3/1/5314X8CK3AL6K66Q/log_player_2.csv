"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000).** This means Alice is still making a profit, and there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.** While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options.** There's a chance Alice might lower her price to secure a deal with Bob, as it's still better for her than selling to John."
