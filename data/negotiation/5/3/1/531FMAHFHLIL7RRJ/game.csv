"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point.

I hope we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

However, given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000.
