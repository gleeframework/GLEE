"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your generosity, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my maximum, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Even though Alice is meeting Bob ""halfway"",  Bob has already made his maximum offer and knows there's a better option.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
