"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $25,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is trying to get a good deal and starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it might be enough to pique Alice's interest and open up negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. There's no point in negotiating further as he can get the product for the same price from John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product without any further risk or delay."
