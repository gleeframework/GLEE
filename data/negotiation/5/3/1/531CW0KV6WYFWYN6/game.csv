"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the price I need to make a profit, but I still want to work with you. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can make a deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
