,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115? ",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $115, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $125? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can close the deal on that.",120.0,Bob,6,
