"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $8500, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. The product is truly unique and has a lot to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I've already offered you $10250 and you're still at $10000. I'm starting to think you're not serious about making a deal.
