"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's much higher than I'm willing to pay. This product is useful to me, but not essential.  I could offer $5,000. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the product is not essential to you, but it's still a valuable item. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway based on your initial offer, I need the price to come down significantly for it to make sense for me. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need the price to come down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10,000. This is my final offer on the lower end, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the value of the product to me, I could go up to $7,500. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go up to $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Alice,7,
