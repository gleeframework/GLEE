"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $9,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little higher than what I'm aiming for. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,
