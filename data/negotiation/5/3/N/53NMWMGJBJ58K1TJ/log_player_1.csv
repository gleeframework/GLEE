Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of significant worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  A price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher once the offer is made.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** While you know Bob's valuation, understanding the broader market for similar products could inform your strategy. 
* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive or passive), you might adjust your approach accordingly."
