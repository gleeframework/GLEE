Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below the value of the product to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price acknowledges the value for you while still being reasonable for me.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another serious offer of $775000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my expectations, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact that we're getting closer. However, $775,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer a final price of $825,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $795000. I believe this is the maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $795,000 is still not high enough for me. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm realizing that John's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly better. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
