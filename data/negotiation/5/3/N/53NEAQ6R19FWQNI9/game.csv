"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you trying to make a deal.  $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $115 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $120. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",120.0,Bob,4,
