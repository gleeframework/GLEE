Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's a good compromise between my minimum ($100) and what I know the product is worth to Bob ($150).  

This strategy allows me to:

* **Start high:** I'm aiming for a good starting price to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  By offering $130, I create space for Bob to make a counteroffer, giving us both room to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $100 gives me confidence to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you trying to make a deal.  $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $115 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $120. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $120 is a good compromise and is still significantly higher than what I could get from John. It's important to be flexible in negotiations and sometimes settle for a price that's a bit less than your ideal to secure a deal."
