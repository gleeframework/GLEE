"Hi Alice, $230 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers [mention a specific feature or benefit that might appeal to Bob] which I believe justifies a higher value. Could you consider something closer to $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $180 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've tried to meet you halfway, but to be completely honest, $120 is below my bottom line.  I could let it go for $145, but that's my absolute best offer. Let me know if that works for you.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $145 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $120.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,6,
