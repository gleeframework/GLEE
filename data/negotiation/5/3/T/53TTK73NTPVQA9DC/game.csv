"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,500, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we land at $10,250? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can do $10,800, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
