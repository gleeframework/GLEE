"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $15,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
