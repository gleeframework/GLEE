"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $15,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair profit. How about we settle at $13,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $15,000. John is a guaranteed sale at that price, and it's within Bob's budget. I'll counter again, hoping to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be worth it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  Would you consider $13,500?  It seems like a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to settle for less than $14,000. It's within his budget and I'm confident I can get that price.  I'll make one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I think we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000.  This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a reasonable price. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $13,750. If you can't agree to that, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for less than my target. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with, so I'm going to sell to him."
