"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of significant value.  I'm offering it to you for $20000.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $16000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $18000?  This would give you a fair price and still allow me to achieve my desired outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $18000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be open to $17000? This would allow us both to make a deal while still staying within our respective budgets.",17000.0,Bob,4,
