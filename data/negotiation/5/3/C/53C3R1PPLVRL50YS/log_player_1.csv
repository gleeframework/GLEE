Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $400,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you a negotiating advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  A price too close to $1,200,000 risks immediate rejection. A price too close to $800,000 leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  This represents significant value considering its potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value to frame Bob's thinking.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,050,000 gives Bob a perceived discount of $150,000, making it more appealing. It also leaves you with a substantial profit above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Tying the price to ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting or walking away to John's offer.
* **Relationship Matters:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. A very aggressive negotiation could damage that, even if you get the higher price."
