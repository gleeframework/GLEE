"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows for a healthy return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure this product for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a substantial margin for profit while allowing me to recoup a significant portion of the value I place on this product. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
