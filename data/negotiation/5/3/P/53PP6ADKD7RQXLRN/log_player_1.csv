Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,750.  How about we compromise at $10,250? It's closer to your price, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000.  However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  Could you go down to $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would make this deal work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It seems Bob and I are stuck at a point where we can't agree on a price. With only a few rounds left, the risk of losing more money by continuing the negotiation is too high. I'm better off selling to John and securing the guaranteed $15,000."
