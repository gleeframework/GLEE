"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000), but it is still within your budget ($1,200,000). However, you have room for negotiation and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-offer process, aiming for a price closer to Alice's potential minimum."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $950,000 is certainly appealing, I'm confident this product will yield even greater returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This recognizes its true worth while acknowledging your initial offer.
