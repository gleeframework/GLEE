"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $9500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. It's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
