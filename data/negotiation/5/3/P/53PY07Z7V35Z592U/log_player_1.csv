Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point considering the product is worth $120 to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm offering $130.  This is a compromise, but I still need to make a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to $120,  $110 is still a reasonable price, and it's better than selling to John for $120."
