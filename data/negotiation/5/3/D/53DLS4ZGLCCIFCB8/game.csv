"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is better, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
