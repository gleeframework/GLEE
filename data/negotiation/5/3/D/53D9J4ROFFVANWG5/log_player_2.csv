"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I understand the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so this offer allows you to make a profit. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice is offering a ""profit"" for Bob, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy from John for a lower price, achieving his goal."
