Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving you some profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, allowing for potential counteroffers and a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is straightforward, focusing on the price and the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to get closer to your initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, you can counteroffer with a slightly higher price, hoping to secure a better deal than selling to John for the same amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to let it go for $12,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to stick to my original price of $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if there's any way we can come to an agreement at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has repeatedly stated he's unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price.  Since John is also willing to pay $12,000, it makes sense to sell to John to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
