"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to let it go for $12,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to stick to my original price of $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if there's any way we can come to an agreement at that price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
