"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $9,500, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. I have 8 rounds remaining, and I can always sell to John for $10,000 if I don't get a more favorable offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though.  How about $11,000?  That would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is only $200 less than what I could get from John.  I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob, and it's worth closing the deal now rather than risking another rejected offer."
