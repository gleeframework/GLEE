{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more from Bob. I'm going to try a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about $90? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $85 is close to my minimum and I'm getting closer to a deal.  I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and having to settle for the lower price from John."
