"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product.  Given its value to you, I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be fair for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a high price, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Appealing to fairness:** Framing the price as ""fair for both of us"" helps establish a collaborative tone and may make Bob more amenable to the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  A $1,000,000 price point leaves enough room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  
* **Staying above my minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $800,000, so this offer keeps me well above that and leaves me in a good position to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum:** While I'd like to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate further.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can signal that I'm willing to stand firm on my price point, potentially putting pressure on him to come up with a better counteroffer.
* **Building leverage:**  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, further demonstrating my control over the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is tempting, I need to consider my own costs and the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise that we can both be happy with. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing concession:** Highlighting ""significant concession"" makes the price seem more attractive and reinforces my commitment to finding a deal.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $950,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Building pressure:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm putting pressure on him to accept or risk losing the deal as we get closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a better price. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $800,000, giving me room to keep negotiating.
* **Building pressure:** By rejecting, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to close the deal and that I'm willing to stand firm on my price.
* **Hoping for a better counteroffer:** There's a chance that Bob, seeing my willingness to hold out, might be willing to increase his offer further.
* **Rounds remaining:**  We still have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $937,500. This is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's seal the deal, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm still showing a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway, keeping the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair for both of us"" to try and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Setting a firm limit:** I'm making it clear that this is ""the lowest I can go"" to signal that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Strategic positioning:** By proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, I'm putting pressure on him to accept or risk losing out.

**Important:** 
* It's crucial to keep track of the rounds remaining.  We're nearing the halfway point, and with each rejection, the risk of needing to sell to John at a lower price increases. 
* The goal is to maximize profits, but also to be aware of the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
