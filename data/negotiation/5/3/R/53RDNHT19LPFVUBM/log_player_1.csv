While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,575,000 is a strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still securing a profit of $375,000 above my minimum. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, rather than risking further negotiation rounds.
* **Uncertainty of Future Offers:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will offer a better price in subsequent rounds, and I risk him walking away."
