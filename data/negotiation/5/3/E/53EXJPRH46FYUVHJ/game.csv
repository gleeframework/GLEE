"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I think $9,500 is a fair price, considering its potential worth. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and it gives us both a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I'm happy to keep negotiating, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  How about we settle at $8,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8750.0,Bob,4,
