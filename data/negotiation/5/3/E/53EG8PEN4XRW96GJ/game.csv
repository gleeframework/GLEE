"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 may be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'll make a counteroffer of $1025000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1025000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'll make a counteroffer of $1000000, which is still a compromise, but I believe it's the minimum I can accept to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle, Alice. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $990000, which is just $10000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've both put into this negotiation. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",990000.0,Alice,9,
