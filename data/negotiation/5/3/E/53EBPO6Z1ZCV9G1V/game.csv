"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really benefit you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is way more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a really great product and well worth that price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still out of my range.  I'm really only able to spend $80 at this point.  Let's see if we can work something out.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're really keen on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $120, my final offer.  It's a steal at this price!",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $120, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $90 right now. Let's try to find some middle ground.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $105?  This is a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  $105 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, and I hope we can find a way to make this work.",95.0,Bob,8,
