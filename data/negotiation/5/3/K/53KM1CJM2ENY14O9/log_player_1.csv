"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to try and counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95.  This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it's still lower than my initial offer.  I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has come down significantly, and $85 is a good amount. It's above my minimum threshold and worth it to close the deal."
