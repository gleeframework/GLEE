"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $150. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to try negotiating a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's initial price, while still leaving room for negotiation.  The friendly tone aims to keep the interaction positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you find $150 a bit high, but $80 is lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, but it's still above your budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do it for $95? I think that would be a fair compromise."",

}
```

This counter-offer attempts to nudge the price closer to your target while maintaining a collaborative tone. By suggesting a specific price and framing it as a compromise, it encourages Alice to consider your perspective."
