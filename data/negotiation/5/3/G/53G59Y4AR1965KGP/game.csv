"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you find $150 a bit high, but $80 is lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do it for $95? I think that would be a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
