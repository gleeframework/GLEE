"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This is important to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to test the waters with this initial offer. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $14000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** $14,000 is higher than my minimum of $10,000, so I'm not desperate to sell right now.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and explore if I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both of us. This helps maintain a good rapport.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll have to reassess my strategy and potentially lower my price further, keeping in mind I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $14000 for your product. This would allow us to stay within my budget while still being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Significant Gain:**  Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, so there's no significant gain in continuing to negotiate. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.
* **Reasonable Price:** $14,000 is a reasonable price, significantly higher than my minimum, and I can still make a good profit. 

**Strategy:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and allows me to avoid the potential risk of losing a deal with either Bob or John. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, it's important to balance potential gains with the risk of a failed negotiation."
