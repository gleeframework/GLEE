Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing Alice closer to her ideal outcome.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offered price is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer, ensuring that Alice is maximizing her potential profit.

This strategy balances ambition with a touch of flexibility, increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob."
