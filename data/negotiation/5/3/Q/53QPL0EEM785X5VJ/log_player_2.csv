"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I was thinking more like $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $105 gets you the product for a decent price, even if it's not the absolute lowest you could potentially negotiate.  Continuing to haggle risks losing the deal entirely."
