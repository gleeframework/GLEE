"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $88, which is closer to my budget and still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $88 is still just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would give you a great deal and would be more in line with what I'm looking for. Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
