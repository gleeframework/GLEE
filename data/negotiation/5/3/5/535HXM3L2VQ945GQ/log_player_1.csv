{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to our desired price. Accepting $1,290,000 provides a significant profit over our minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer.  The further we go, the greater the risk that Bob walks away, leaving us with John's lower offer."
