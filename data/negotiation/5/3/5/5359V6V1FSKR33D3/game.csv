"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and your budgetary needs.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on.  To be frank, $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part while still ensuring I get a fair value for the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
