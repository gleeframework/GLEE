Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer and potentially lower the price to secure a sale. However, I'll keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind and won't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I believe this price is fair and likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
