"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's original price of $12,000, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000, which is still above his maximum of $8,000 but significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $10,000. This is still higher than Bob's ideal price from John ($8,000), but it's closer to Bob's maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob might end up paying more.  Therefore, accepting the offer at $10,000 is a reasonable compromise."
