# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also takes into account your budget concerns. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is offering a price that's a good deal below my maximum.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice, and there's a risk she'll stop negotiating. It's better to accept this reasonable offer."
