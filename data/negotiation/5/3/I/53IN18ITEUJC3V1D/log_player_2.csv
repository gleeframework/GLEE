"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also less than what John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000 compared to John's price."
