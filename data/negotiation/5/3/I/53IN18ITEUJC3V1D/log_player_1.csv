Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:**  There's a potential $200,000 profit margin (Bob's value - your minimum).

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation.
2. **Appear Flexible:**  You don't want to scare Bob off with an unreasonable initial offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,150,000  gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a significant portion of the profit margin.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message invites Bob to counter-offer, fostering a collaborative negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The phrase ""given its potential value"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  The best negotiation strategy depends on factors like your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiation style."
