"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a bit more within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite capture the full potential of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve our goals.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1,275,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll gain from this product while ensuring I can achieve my financial goals.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer to my target. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm eager to close this deal, but $1,225,000 doesn't quite work for me. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.  I'm willing to come down to $1,260,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize the transaction.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
