Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $100, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for a potential $19 profit instead of just $10.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below the $100 mark, potentially making Bob perceive it as a better deal than it is, given his valuation of $80. 
* **Simple and Clear:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the ""special price"" to entice Bob."
