"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make a living, and $10,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a living, and I'm trying to be fair.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
