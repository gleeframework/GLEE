# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's way over his budget.  He's got room to negotiate, and he should see what kind of counter-offer he can get from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still a bit too high. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price.  Remember, he can always buy from John if he doesn't get a good deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make a living, and $10,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject this offer. While Alice is coming down, $11,200 is still a bit too high. He can keep trying to negotiate and potentially get a better price. If the next few rounds don't yield a better offer, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a living, and I'm trying to be fair.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
