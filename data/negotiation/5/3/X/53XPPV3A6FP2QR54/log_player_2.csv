I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while staying well within my budget."

While Alice is coming down, I can still try to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price well below Alice's last offer and my maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a good offer. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and I'm not willing to pay significantly more than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
