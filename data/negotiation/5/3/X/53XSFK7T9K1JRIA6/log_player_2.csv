Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While she's come down some, $900,000 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price again."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's above his ideal price, it's still lower than what John is selling for and it's unlikely Alice will come down further. It's a good deal for Bob, given the negotiation history."
