"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good price, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can't go as low as $1,075,000, but I'm prepared to come down to $1,090,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
