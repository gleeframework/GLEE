"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  I think it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but well below my minimum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win outcome.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message sets the stage for a constructive negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By starting at $115, I allow Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer. This keeps him engaged in the process and potentially leads to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $120 I need to consider it a good deal. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate.  I can counter with a price closer to my target while still leaving some room for compromise.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I have the opportunity to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $110. This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm counteroffering with a clear explanation of why $110 is a fair price, emphasizing the benefits for both of us.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I get a good price for the product. 
* **Maintaining Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive to encourage Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $108 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $108 is still below my minimum of $120.  
* **Time and Potential:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have the time to try and push for a better price.  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price that meets my minimum.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations fall through, I have the option to sell to John for $120, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about we split the difference and go with $109? This would be a fair price for both of us and bring us closer to an agreement.  Let's try to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is the midpoint between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $108.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows good faith.
* **Strong Closing Language:**  I'm using enthusiastic and persuasive language to emphasize the benefits of accepting my offer and encourage Bob to reach a decision.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:**  $109 is still above my minimum of $120, but it's getting closer to my bottom line.  I'm still willing to negotiate but I'm also holding firm on my minimum price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the deal. This counteroffer is a strong attempt to push Bob towards accepting a price that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $106 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $106 is still below my minimum of $120.  
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, time is becoming a factor. I need to start considering John's offer seriously.
* **Close to my bottom line:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I need to weigh the risk of losing Bob and not securing any deal at all.
* **Strategic decision:** I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price. If he rejects it, I'll likely move to John to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I want to make sure we both get a fair deal. I'm willing to go down to $107, but this is my final offer. I'm confident this is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last attempt to get Bob to agree. I'm making it clear this is my final offer to encourage him to accept. 
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm compromising a bit further by dropping to $107, but it's still above my minimum.
* **Urgency and Enthusiasm:** I'm using language like ""final offer"" and ""let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards accepting.
* **Decision Time:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $104 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is critical:** We are down to the last 3 rounds, and it's clear that Bob is not going to budge on his price. 
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  John is willing to pay my minimum of $120, guaranteeing a successful sale. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of ending the round without a sale, leaving me with nothing. 

With John's offer as a safety net, it makes more sense to accept his offer and ensure a profitable transaction.  Further negotiation with Bob is too risky at this point."
