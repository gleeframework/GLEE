{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a lot to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

While Alice's offer is closer, it's still above my maximum. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a good deal.  While I value your business, $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This price is fair to both of us and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would give you the full value you've stated for the product. Let's close this deal at this fair price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
