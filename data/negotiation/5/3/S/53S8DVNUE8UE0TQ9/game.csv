"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $650,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll receive. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $725,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. How about we split the difference and settle on $787,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to close the deal quickly.",787500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, that figure is just a bit outside my budget. I can do $750,000, and I think that's a very fair offer. It allows me to get the product and stay within my spending limit. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm committed to making this deal happen. However, $750,000 is still not enough for me to move forward.  I'm willing to come down to $775,000, which is a very reasonable compromise. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Alice,7,
