"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're open to this.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
