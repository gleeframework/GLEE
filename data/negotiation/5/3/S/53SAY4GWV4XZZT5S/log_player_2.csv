"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between Bob's maximum budget and Alice's initial offer.  By offering $10,500, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his price range.  This strategy aims to encourage Alice to consider a lower price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's not guaranteed.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the best possible price and avoids further negotiation that may or may not lead to a successful outcome."
