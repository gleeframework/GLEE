Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price. It allows for negotiation room while still giving you a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
