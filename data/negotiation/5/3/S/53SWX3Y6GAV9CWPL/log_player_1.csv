Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $1,500,000, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I need to be realistic about his willingness to pay.
* **Negotiation room:**  By starting at $1,750,000, I leave room for negotiation, but I'm still well above my minimum.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a starting point. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate. However, I have the option of accepting John's offer at any time, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I still value the product at $1,500,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.
* **Negotiation room:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer closer to my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell.  I have the option of selling to John at any time for a higher price, which keeps me in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I value the product at $1,500,000, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Bob's offer:**  Bob offered $1,400,000, which is closer to my minimum but still not acceptable.
* **Negotiation room:**  This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but gives me some space to negotiate further if needed.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $1,600,000, I'm showing flexibility while still ensuring I don't sell below my minimum.  This should encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a price closer to my desired outcome. I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net and leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I still value the product at $1,500,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer is now below my minimum.
* **Negotiation room:**  I've already made concessions, and further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.

**Strategy:**

Since Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, it's more beneficial to sell to John. I'm guaranteed a price that meets my valuation, and I can avoid the potential of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to an even lower price."
