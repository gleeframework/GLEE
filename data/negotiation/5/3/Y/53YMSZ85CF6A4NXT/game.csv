"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a one-time price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range. To be honest, $9,000 is the highest I can go.  If that doesn't work for you, I might have to check out some other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
