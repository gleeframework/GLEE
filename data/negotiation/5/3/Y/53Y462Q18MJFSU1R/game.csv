"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000? This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
