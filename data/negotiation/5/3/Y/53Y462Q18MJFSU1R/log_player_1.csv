"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly stating why I've chosen this particular price. This keeps the reasoning open-ended for Bob to respond to.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts my initial high offer, I'll earn significantly more than my minimum.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how interested he is in the product and how high he's willing to go.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By setting the initial price high, I'm taking control of the negotiation's direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own stated value of the product ($800,000). This suggests he has room to move significantly. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about negotiating a price that reflects the product's true value.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob than selling to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and making a concession by dropping the price by $200,000. However, I'm still holding firm well above both his offer and my minimum to demonstrate the product's value.
* **Justify the Price:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's market value to justify the high price and counter Bob's lowball offer.
* **Encourage a Counteroffer:**  By stating this is my price ""to move forward,"" I'm implying I'm open to further negotiation but need Bob to meet me closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground. Your last offer is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still far below my minimum and suggests he's not yet serious about meeting a price that reflects the product's value.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get him closer to my range.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds since I have the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000? This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to my Minimum:**  I'm dropping my price significantly to match my absolute minimum acceptable price.  This is a strategic move to anchor the negotiation around this number, signaling to Bob that this is a serious offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob why this price is justified, even if it's higher than his previous offers.

By moving directly to my minimum, I'm taking a calculated risk.  Bob might walk away, but it also puts the pressure on him to either accept a price closer to my target or significantly improve his offer if he truly wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that's still too high. I can do $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached his stated value for the product. While it's less than I hoped for, it's still a significant profit above my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate risks him walking away, leaving me to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's better to accept a slightly lower price now than risk losing this deal altogether."
