Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  I need to make at least $1,000,000 from this sale to be happy. 
* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000.
* **John's value:** I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay $1,000,000.

**Strategy:** 

By offering $900,000, I'm:

* **Maximizing my potential profit:**  I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's maximum value, but it's still a significant discount from what I could get from John.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob is truly interested, there's a possibility we can negotiate a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Mitigating risk:**  Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have John as a backup, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit."
