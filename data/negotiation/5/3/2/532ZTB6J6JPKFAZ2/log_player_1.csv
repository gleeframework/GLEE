{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) and leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  It's also close to the perceived value of the product for Bob, making it more likely for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $125 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $130. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to the middle ground between our initial offers. I hope this will incentivize Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
