"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is way over his budget. He has rounds to go and can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While that price doesn't work for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we consider $1,150,000? This reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  $1,150,000 is still too high. While he's interested, he needs to keep pushing for a lower price. He's already shown Alice he's serious about buying but has a budget, so she's more likely to budge now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm genuinely trying to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my commitment to making this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already shown he's serious about buying the product at his budget, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer.  While $975,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. How about we try $900,000? This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: $980,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I believe this is fair considering the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already shown his commitment to buying the product, but Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $980,000.  He only has three rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will budge any further.  Buying from John will save him $180,000 and allow him to get the product he wants."
