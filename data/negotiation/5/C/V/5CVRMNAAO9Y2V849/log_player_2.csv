"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is far too high for Bob's budget of $120.  It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal, and starting at his maximum budget is a good strategy. By being upfront and honest about his budget, he hopes to encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $165 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet at $140?  I'm confident we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm with his negotiation strategy. He's incrementally increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but also pushing for a better price. $140 is a reasonable middle ground, and Bob is hoping Alice will see that it's a good deal for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above Bob's budget of $120. While Alice has lowered her price significantly, Bob has a clear alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for $120. At this point, it makes more financial sense for Bob to buy the product from John and save $35.  It's important to remember that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
