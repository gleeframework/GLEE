"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point that aligns better with my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet at $1,300,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
