"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $250 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $180. I think it's a fair price for this unique product, and I'd love to hear what you think.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $180, but it's still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $100 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $100, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $100, which would be $140. I think that's a fair price for this unique product, and I'd love to hear what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can close the deal.  ",120.0,Bob,6,
