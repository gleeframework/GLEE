"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this item for $119. I believe you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $119 is close to your limit, you know John will sell it to you for $120. By rejecting this offer, you give yourself a chance to see if Alice will lower her price, getting you a better deal."
