Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me.  I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects this, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept an offer that is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is still above my minimum price, but it shows my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and will accept it."
