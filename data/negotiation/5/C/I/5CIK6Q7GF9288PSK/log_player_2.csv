"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than what John is asking, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still aiming for a lower amount.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $850,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we settle on $875,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product and our respective positions. "", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $885,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $875,000.  At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, as Alice has already stated this is her final offer.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is significantly lower than what John is offering, achieving Bob's goal of saving money."
