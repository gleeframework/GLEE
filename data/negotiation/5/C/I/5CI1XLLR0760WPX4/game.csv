"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I believe is a fair value considering its worth to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I could buy it from John for less.",8500.0,Bob,4,
