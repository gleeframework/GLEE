{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can't go down to $100, but I'm willing to drop the price to $110. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, I can't go lower than $112. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's settle this, I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 112} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. Can you meet me at $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk wasting more time.  John is already willing to pay my asking price, so it's in my best interest to sell to him now and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
