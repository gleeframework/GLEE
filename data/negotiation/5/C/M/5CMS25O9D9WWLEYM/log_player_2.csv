"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.  He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, it's the highest price. Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to try to get a better deal without risking the $1,500,000. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. This will start a back-and-forth negotiation, giving Bob a chance to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is offering $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $1,400,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer signals Bob's intent to negotiate seriously and find a mutually beneficial price.  
* **Negotiation Range:**  By starting at $1,300,000, Bob sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation where he can potentially secure a price closer to his target.  

**Key Considerations:**

* **Alice's Response:** It's important to pay attention to Alice's response to this counteroffer. If she rejects it, Bob might need to adjust his offer further.  
* **Time Limit:**  It's crucial to keep in mind that Bob can always decide to buy from John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Alice takes too long or becomes unproductive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise.  Here's why Bob should accept:

* **Good Deal:** $1,350,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or the negotiation taking too long. Accepting ensures a deal at a good price.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  Even though Bob is accepting, he can still try to negotiate additional terms or concessions with Alice, such as delivery arrangements or payment schedule. 

**Overall:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision, balancing the desire for a lower price with the risk of a prolonged negotiation or a higher price from John."
