"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $900,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,012,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle again and go with $993,750. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",993750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $993,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you halfway between $1,012,500 and $993,750, which would be $1,003,125. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",1003125.0,Alice,7,
