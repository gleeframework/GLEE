Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially gives you room to negotiate. A price of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still netting you a significant profit over John's offer. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential earnings from Bob while still being aware of your fallback option."
