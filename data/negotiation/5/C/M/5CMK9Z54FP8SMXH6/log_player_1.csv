Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product because John acts as your safety net.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate over. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he got a good deal, potentially making him hesitate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's privileged position as the first to receive an offer.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential surplus value while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 incentive to accept. This price point balances profit maximization with the need to secure a deal. 

**Important Note:** There's always an element of risk in negotiation.  Bob could try to negotiate a lower price, or he might be turned off by what he perceives as too high an initial offer. However, this strategy provides a strong starting point for maximizing your potential profit."
