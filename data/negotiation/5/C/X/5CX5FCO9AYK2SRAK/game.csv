"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $10,000.  This gives you a great deal, and ensures I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
