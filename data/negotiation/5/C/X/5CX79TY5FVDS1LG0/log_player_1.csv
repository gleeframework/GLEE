Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000 if you are open to discussing further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept a price as low as $1,800,000. Could you consider $1,900,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,700,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

While Bob's offer is tempting, it has reached a point where it's no longer financially beneficial to continue negotiating. Accepting a price lower than John's guaranteed offer would be a loss."
