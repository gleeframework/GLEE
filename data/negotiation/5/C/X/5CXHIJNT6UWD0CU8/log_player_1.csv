Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your estimate. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $17,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $14,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away. John's offer guarantees $15,000, but the potential upside of a higher price from Bob is now outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that can be reinvested or utilized elsewhere. 

Therefore, accepting $14,000 secures a strong profit with minimal risk.
