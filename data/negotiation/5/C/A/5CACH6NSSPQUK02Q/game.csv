"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is way below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you can't go as low as $5,000, Alice.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer and settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about we compromise at $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'd still be getting a great deal on a valuable product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
