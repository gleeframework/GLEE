Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth and a potential compromise.
* **John as a backup:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a solid baseline and allows me to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than his own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's initial offer is unreasonable, it indicates he's interested. There's potential to reach a compromise in further negotiations.
* **John as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if I can't secure a better price with Bob. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is way below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still significantly above his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for a price that drastically undervalues my product.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'm not dropping to his initial offer, demonstrating that I won't be easily swayed by lowballing.
* **Leaving room for a compromise:** There's still room for further negotiation, which is beneficial if Bob is truly interested in the product.
* **Keep John in mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer and won't settle for anything less than my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as $5,000, Alice.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer and settle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial proposal, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a considerable financial loss for me.
* **Possibility for further negotiation:**  Bob seems willing to negotiate and is showing a willingness to compromise. There's still room to reach a more agreeable price in the next round.
* **Safety net with John:**  I have the secure option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage in negotiations and allows me to walk away if needed.

I will proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about we compromise at $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'd still be getting a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to a compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's latest proposal, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  $10,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and close to his perceived value, showing I'm not willing to settle for a low price. 
* **Balancing value and negotiation:** I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good price for myself and reaching a deal with Bob. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** This offer still provides a substantial profit compared to selling to John, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
