"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $80, but I'm not willing to go as high as $200. Let's aim for a price that's around $120.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
