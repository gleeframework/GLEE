"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm thinking of a price around $9,500. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is within your budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $8,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. You want to try and get a better price, so rejecting the initial offer is the best strategy to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  You've started by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum value. This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:** You've provided a reason for your counteroffer, making it sound more like a genuine negotiation rather than just a lowball offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** You've ended with a question, inviting Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like.  You're willing to pay a bit more than your initial $8,500 offer, but there's still room for negotiation to get closer to your target price.  It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $8,800.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** You've increased your offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Compromise:**  You've emphasized that this is a ""fair compromise,"" making your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Closing the Deal:** You've expressed your desire to close the deal, putting pressure on Alice to accept your offer."
