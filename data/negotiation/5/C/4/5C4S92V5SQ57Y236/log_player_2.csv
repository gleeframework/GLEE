"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $160 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high.  It's more than double what the product is worth to me.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $160 is way too high for me.  I'm happy to pay up to $80 for this product.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is still too high. I'm not going to go much above my initial counteroffer.  I'll reject and see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $120 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I want to be fair, $90 is still quite low for me. How about we do $110? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still too high.  I've already made several counteroffers, and she hasn't budged much.  It's not worth continuing this negotiation.  I'll go with John's offer, which is the best price I've found so far."
