"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $100, it's a good starting point to reject Alice's offer.  This allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do $80?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
