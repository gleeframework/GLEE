Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, implying I'm open to negotiating. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while giving myself room to adjust the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do $80?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer is the best decision in this scenario.  Since I can sell to John for the same price, there's no benefit to continuing negotiations and risking getting a lower offer or losing time."
