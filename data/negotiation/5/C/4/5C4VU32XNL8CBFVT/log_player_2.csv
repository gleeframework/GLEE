Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised offer is $12,500. I think this is as low as I can go while still making a fair profit. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
