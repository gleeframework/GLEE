"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still more than your desired price point of $8,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target price of $8,000. Continue negotiating with Alice. There's still room for a more favorable deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $9,500?  It's closer to your last offer, and it would allow me to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to go a bit further. How about $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit.  Since you have the option of buying the product from John for $8,000, it's the best choice in this scenario.  You save $2,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
