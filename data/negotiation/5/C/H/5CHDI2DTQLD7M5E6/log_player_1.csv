Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and engaging to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'm tempted by the quick sale to John, I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference - how about $82.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. How about $80 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal.  While selling to John would guarantee the same price, I've successfully negotiated with Bob and reached a mutually agreeable outcome."
