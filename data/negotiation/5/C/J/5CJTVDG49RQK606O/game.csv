"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think this might not be the right deal for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200, but I'm not going to go any lower. If you're serious about buying the product, this is the last offer I'm going to make.  Let me know what you decide.",10200.0,Alice,5,
