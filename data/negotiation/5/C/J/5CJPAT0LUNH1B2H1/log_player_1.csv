Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification for the price:**  While mentioning the product's ""true worth"" is somewhat vague, it plants the seed that the value might be even higher than Bob initially perceives. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""discuss further"" signals that you are willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage rather than walk away immediately.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
