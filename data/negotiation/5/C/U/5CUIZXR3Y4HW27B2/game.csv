"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth over $150 to me. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $200 for it. I believe this is a fair offer given its value.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $120 for the product? This still reflects its value to me while accommodating your financial situation.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $120 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can only go up to $90.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and my budget constraints.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try $100 as the price for the product. It's still above what I initially offered but closer to your proposed price, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $95. This is a good compromise and hopefully, we can finalize the deal. ",95.0,Bob,6,
