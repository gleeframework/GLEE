"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the original price I was willing to accept.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. I propose we meet at $1,012,500. This is the best compromise I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
