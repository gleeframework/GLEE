# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the original price I was willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still get the product for cheaper from John. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. I propose we meet at $1,012,500. This is the best compromise I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,012,500 is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John ensures the lowest possible price.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better deal, and the risk of going over budget outweighs the potential for further savings."
