I will reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still try to get a good deal. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $13,000 is a good deal and it's only one round away from my minimum. I don't want to risk losing this sale to John."
