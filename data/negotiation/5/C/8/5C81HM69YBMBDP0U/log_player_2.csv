Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at a price higher than what John is offering.  While it might be tempting to try and negotiate Alice down further, there's a risk she won't budge, and we'll miss out on getting the product for $100 from John."
