,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I really think $1,050,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go up any higher. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1,050,000. Is there any room for negotiation?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
