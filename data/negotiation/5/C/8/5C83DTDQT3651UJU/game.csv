"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $120 to us. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $150 for it. This offer includes a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, during which you can return the product if you're not completely satisfied. Would you be interested in discussing this further?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality and features of your product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the offer of $100. Our product has exceptional features and quality, and we believe it deserves a price that reflects its true value. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $120, which is closer to our original asking price. This would allow us to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the transaction. I hope you find this proposal more acceptable.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, I still feel that $120 is slightly above my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle, such as $110? I'm hoping for a price that better aligns with my financial constraints while still allowing me to benefit from your product's quality.",110.0,Bob,4,
