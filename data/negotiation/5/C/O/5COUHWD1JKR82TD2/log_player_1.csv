"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000.  This initial high offer serves a few purposes:

* **Establishes a strong starting point:** It shows Bob that I value the product highly and am not afraid to ask for a good price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It allows for some wiggle room in case Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **Tests the waters:** This will give me a sense of Bob's seriousness and his perceived value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a great deal!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable value and the number of rounds remaining. 
* **If the negotiation drags on or stalls:**  I'll always have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out completely."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum value,  I'm not going to settle for that right away.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's immediate offer of $1,000,000 shows he's likely willing to pay more. I can use this to my advantage in future rounds.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 9 rounds left. If I don't get a better offer now, I can always accept Bob's offer later or sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer but still leaving room for negotiation. I'll be mindful of Bob's potential to reject my offer and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations stall."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,250,000 represents a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm not willing to accept his initial price and am still aiming for a better deal.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his next counteroffer carefully.  I may need to make further concessions, but I'll still try to get as close to $1,250,000 as possible.
* **If the negotiations stall:** I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind and may decide to sell to him if the negotiation drags on."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. Here's why:

* **Still room for improvement:**  I'm confident I can get a higher price, especially considering Bob's willingness to increase his offer.
* **Remaining rounds:** I still have 6 rounds left, which gives me time to continue negotiations and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's offer:** While $1,100,000 is better than John's $1,000,000, I'm not in a rush to settle.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again in Round 5, aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000 but still acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate.  I'll keep an eye on the remaining rounds and be prepared to accept a lower offer if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,150,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still below my previous counteroffer, signaling a willingness to compromise.

**Reasons:**

* **Middle Ground:** This offer positions me in the middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. It shows I'm taking his offers seriously while remaining firm on my desired value.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Continuing to counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving and increases the chance of finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While I'm willing to move towards a lower price, I'm not settling for the minimum just yet. With several rounds remaining, there's still potential for a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a good price with some room for negotiation.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or consider selling to John.
* **If the Negotiations Stall:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'll continue to negotiate as long as I believe there's a chance for a better deal."
