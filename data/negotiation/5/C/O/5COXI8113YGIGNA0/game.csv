"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly is worth it, and I'm confident you'd be happy with it.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too much for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get great value out of this product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
