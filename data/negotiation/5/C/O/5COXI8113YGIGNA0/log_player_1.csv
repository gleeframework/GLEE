Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly is worth it, and I'm confident you'd be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too much for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get great value out of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firmly rooted at $13,000 and unlikely to budge. It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
