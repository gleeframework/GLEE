"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly.  Here's why:

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting low shows you're serious about a deal, but $80 is still a significant increase from your absolute limit ($100).
* **Opens Negotiation:**  This gives Alice room to counter-offer, allowing you to gauge her flexibility and potentially meet in the middle.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Remember, you have John as a backup option. This knowledge gives you confidence to walk away if the deal isn't good."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. Let's continue negotiating."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $95? That's a reasonable increase from my initial offer and puts us closer to a price point that works for me."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counter-offer:

* **Moving Up, But Slowly:** Showing willingness to increase your offer demonstrates good faith, but the increment is small to signal you're still budget-conscious.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $95 feels significantly lower than $100 psychologically, potentially making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still a good distance from John's offer ($100), giving you room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $95, which would be $117.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's still acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but we're still above our budget.  We've got one more round in us before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. I can tell we both want to make a deal happen. How about $100? That's my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Clearly stating this is your best and final offer can push Alice to make a decision.
* **Meeting Your Limit:**  You're at the top of your budget, so you're not overspending.
* **Justified Reasoning:**  By emphasizing the value *you* place on the product (which is less than Alice's), you're not insulting her product, but making it clear you won't go higher. 

Now it's up to Alice. If she accepts, you've got a deal! If not, you can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $117.50. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm confident that John is still interested in buying the product for $150, and I'd rather sell it to him at that price than compromise further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away.  Here's why:

* **Alice is Firm:** Her language (""final offer"", ""willing to walk away"") indicates she won't budge further.
* **Over Budget:** $117.50 still exceeds your $100 limit.
* **John's Deal is Better:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. 

While you didn't get the price down as much as you hoped, you stuck to your budget and have a reliable backup plan!"
