Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John as Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale of $100 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $130, you are aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  It's significantly less than his perceived value.
* **Profitable for You:**  It's a $30 profit margin, which is better than your backup offer.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still giving Bob a good deal."
