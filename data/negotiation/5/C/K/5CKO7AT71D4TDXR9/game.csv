"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $14,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $15,500?  This is a fair compromise and gives you a great deal on a truly valuable product.  Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
