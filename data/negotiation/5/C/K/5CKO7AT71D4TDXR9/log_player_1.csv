"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love!  I'm offering it to you for $17,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone can help build rapport and keep Bob engaged. 
* **Room for Compromise:** While $17,000 is above Bob's ideal, it leaves space for him to counter without feeling like he's being pushed too hard. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm aiming for a price that's better than $15,000 while still giving Bob incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There are still 8 rounds remaining. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering.
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not conceding too much.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that $16,000 is still a good price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using a positive tone to keep the conversation going and maintain a sense of possibility.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing John's offer provides me with a strong safety net if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** With 6 rounds remaining, I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 allows me to hold out for a better offer.
* **Negotiation tactic:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $14,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $15,500?  This is a fair compromise and gives you a great deal on a truly valuable product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down further in price.
* **Highlighting the deal:**  I'm reminding Bob that $15,500 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using enthusiastic language to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob's offer ($14,500) is still below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Limited rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, there's not enough time to potentially negotiate a higher price from Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a satisfactory outcome and secure my minimum profit."
