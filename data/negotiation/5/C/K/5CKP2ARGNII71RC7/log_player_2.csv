Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Can we discuss this further?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget of $12,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob is better off buying from John.  John's price is exactly at Bob's budget, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Alice to raise her price again."
