"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to see if he's willing to meet me at a price significantly higher than my minimum. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to avoid selling to John as his offer is lower than my desired price, I'm not willing to accept a price that is so low. I will counteroffer to see if I can reach a price closer to my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but still aiming for a significant profit.  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I am still hoping to negotiate a better price, so I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to compromise and meet him halfway. If he still rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as the risk of getting a lower price from Bob increases with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not at a level that I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try one more counteroffer in the next round to see if I can close the deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

I'm going to take a gamble and offer my minimum price.  I'm running out of rounds, and I'm unsure if Bob is willing to go higher. If he rejects, I'll have to sell to John and accept the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and there are only two rounds left. Bob's offer is close to my minimum but not quite there.  To guarantee I get at least my minimum price, I will sell to John for $800,000."
