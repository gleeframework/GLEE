Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However,  $18000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $15000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $15000. How about we settle on $15500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make a deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
