"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $725000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",725000.0,Alice,3,
