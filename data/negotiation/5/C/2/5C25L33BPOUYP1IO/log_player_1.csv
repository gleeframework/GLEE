"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $115. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $105 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price,  $95 is still a reasonable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
