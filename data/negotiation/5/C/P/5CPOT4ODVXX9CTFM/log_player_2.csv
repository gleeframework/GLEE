"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than Bob's maximum price of $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice is now offering the product for $105, which is still below Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer again, leading to a stalemate or forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Saving:**  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $15 compared to buying from John.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a good deal while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
