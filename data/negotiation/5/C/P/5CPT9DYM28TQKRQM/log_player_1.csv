""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,999 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and a potential ""deal"" feeling for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially allowing me to secure a slightly higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This offer assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or potential alternatives he might have."
