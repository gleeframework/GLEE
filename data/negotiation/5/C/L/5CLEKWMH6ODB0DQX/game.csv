"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it for $925,000. This price reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand the price is a significant factor for you.  In the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the absolute lowest price I can go while still reflecting the product's value.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can meet at this price.",850000.0,Bob,6,
