"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure a deal, accepting such a low offer would result in a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it for $925,000. This price reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $825,000 is still a significant loss compared to John's offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand the price is a significant factor for you.  In the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the absolute lowest price I can go while still reflecting the product's value."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $850,000. Continuing the negotiation poses the risk of a lower final offer, increasing time commitment, and potentially losing John's offer. Accepting John's $1,000,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome."
