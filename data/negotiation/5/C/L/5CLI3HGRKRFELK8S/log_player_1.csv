"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can come to a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a price of $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine, but it's still below my minimum. I'll try to steer him closer to my range.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is quite high in the current market, and $12,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Could you do $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered the situation carefully and am willing to offer $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky one! Bob met my minimum acceptable price. 

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Even though I could hold out and hope to get more from Bob, there's a risk he'll lower his offer. Taking the sure $15,000 now is the safest and most logical choice."
