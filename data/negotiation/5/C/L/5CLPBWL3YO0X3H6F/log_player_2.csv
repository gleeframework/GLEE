"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, giving you a significant advantage. This is a one-time offer, so please consider it carefully. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $1,100,000, while John wants $1,200,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, while Alice only values it at $1,000,000. This means there is a potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $100,000 compared to buying from John."
