{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product has for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Starts high:**  Gives you more room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appeals to Bob's needs:** By highlighting the product's value to him, it increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** If Bob counters, you can still lower your price while still earning more than your minimum goal.
* **Provides a backup plan:** The mention of selling to John serves as a reminder that you have options and are not desperate for Bob's agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too low for me to accept at this point. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $12,500 is a compromise that meets Bob halfway between his initial offer and my minimum desired price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $12,500 is closer, but still a little steep for me.  Could you do $11,000?
