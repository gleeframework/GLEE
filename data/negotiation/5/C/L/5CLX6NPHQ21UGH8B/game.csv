"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  $950,000 doesn't cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
