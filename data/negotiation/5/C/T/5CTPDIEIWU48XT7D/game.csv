"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,250,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident in the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's close this deal.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
