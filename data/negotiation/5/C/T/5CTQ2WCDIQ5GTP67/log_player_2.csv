Round 3

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a tough pill to swallow; this product is top-of-the-line!  To be fair to both of us, I'll come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

However, I'm starting to think that Alice is getting close to her bottom line, and I might not be able to get a better deal. I'll try to make a slightly lower offer, but I'm not sure if Alice will accept it.
