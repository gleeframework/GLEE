Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this offer represents a significant value for you, considering its potential worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below your guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to frame the price in a positive light, even though it's above Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still highly profitable for you (and potentially more palatable for him than a lower starting point).
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you are secure knowing you can sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
