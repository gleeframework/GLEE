"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product is really high-quality and valuable. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here.  While $9,000 is better, I'm still taking a significant hit.  Could you do $10,500? That's the lowest I can go.",10500.0,Alice,5,
