Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I propose a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it aligns with the value it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify a price higher than Bob's perceived worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,500,000, there's room for Bob to negotiate down. This strategy allows you to potentially secure a price higher than $1,000,000 even if Bob counters your initial offer.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"":**  Creating a sense of scarcity and desirability can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price."
