"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to $800,000.  I believe this price is still fair considering the value it brings to my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
