"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9500. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's price of $10,000, Bob can still do better. 

Since Bob values the product at $10,000, he has room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her offer opens the door for potential counter-offers or further negotiation."
