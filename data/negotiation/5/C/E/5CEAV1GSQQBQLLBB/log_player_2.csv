# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1200000, which is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though you value the product at $1,500,000, Alice's offer of $1,200,000 saves you $300,000. 
* **It's a fair compromise.** While Alice values the product at $800,000, she's willing to sell for $1,200,000. This indicates she's willing to negotiate, and you're getting a good deal."
