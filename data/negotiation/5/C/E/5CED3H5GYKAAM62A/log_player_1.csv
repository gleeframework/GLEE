{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Offering it at $119 maximizes potential profit from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, offering it at $119 leaves room for him to perceive value and potentially accept, even though it's slightly below my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
