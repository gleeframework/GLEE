"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1800000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000 to show my commitment to making this deal work. This price is still fair considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This is a significant jump from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of your product while remaining within my budget. Let's make this deal work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
