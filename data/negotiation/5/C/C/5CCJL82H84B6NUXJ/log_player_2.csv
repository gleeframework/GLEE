# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1800000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,800,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for your product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000 to show my commitment to making this deal work. This price is still fair considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,500,000 is a lot lower than the original price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of your product while remaining within my budget. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
