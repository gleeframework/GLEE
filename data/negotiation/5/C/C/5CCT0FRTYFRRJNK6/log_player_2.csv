"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. I know it's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing you're willing to pay up to $100. There's room to negotiate or see if she'll drop the price closer to her own valuation."
