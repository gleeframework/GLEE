"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's potential to negotiate further and get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore counteroffers and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between Alice's offer and his desired price.  He's offering a significant discount from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $8,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's only $300 above his counteroffer and significantly less than John's price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him a significant amount of money.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting future offers or the deal falling apart isn't worth the potential small savings."
