Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I need to get a return that reflects that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away or the negotiations stalling."
