Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $17,000. This is a bit higher than what it's worth to him, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly less than what I would get from John. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a further round of negotiation with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $16,000. This is still a good deal for him, as it's less than what he's willing to pay, and it's closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be a compromise he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement."
