"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need something closer to $13,500 to make this work. It's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $13,500. I am firm in my commitment to not exceed $12,000 for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
