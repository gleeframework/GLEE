Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should go with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price. I'm not willing to settle for that.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need something closer to $13,500 to make this work. It's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $13,500. I am firm in my commitment to not exceed $12,000 for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been firm at $12,000, and I'm not willing to go that low. It's time to cut my losses and move on.  John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which is much closer to my desired price."
