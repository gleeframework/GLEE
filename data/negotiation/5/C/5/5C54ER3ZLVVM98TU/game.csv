"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
