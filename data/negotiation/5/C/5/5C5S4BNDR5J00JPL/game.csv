"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my initial offer reflects the significant value this product brings.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it represents a fair offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I'm motivated to find a solution.  To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial asking price while still recognizing the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still beyond what I can afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I'm confident this price accurately reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal given the value this product offers.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this offer reflects the value we both see in this deal and is the most I can realistically afford. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
