**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John.  Continuing with Bob at this point carries more risk than potential reward."
