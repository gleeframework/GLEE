Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's important to be confident but open to negotiation. I'm also aware I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I don't have to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by selling to John.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's important to make a decision that maximizes my profit."
