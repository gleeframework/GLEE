"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I can consider $950,000. This still represents a significant investment for you but reflects the product's potential. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still a ways off from that number.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
