"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while still giving me a substantial return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit off on the price.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still working within a specific budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer at this time.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 one last time. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. If you are unable to meet this offer, I will unfortunately have to move forward with another buyer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
