"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However,  $2,300,000 is quite high. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a more reasonable starting point.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a considerable advantage.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,300,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I understand your position, we're still quite a bit apart.  This product offers substantial value, and I need to reflect that in the price.  Would you consider $1,650,000? This is a significant compromise on my end.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
