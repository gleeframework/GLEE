Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value for the product, but still leaves room for profit.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $12,000.  This strategy balances maximizing my profit while still having a good chance of getting Bob to agree."
