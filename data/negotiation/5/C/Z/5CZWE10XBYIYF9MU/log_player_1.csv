Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a bit higher than what Bob values the product at, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point because it's a reasonable price, considering your own valuation. This will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your willingness to sell. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the minimum you're willing to accept.  We'll counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
