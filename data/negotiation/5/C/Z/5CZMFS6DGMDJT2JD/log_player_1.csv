While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $900,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still within my desired profit range.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to keep the negotiation focused on a fair price.  Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit shy of $825,000. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $787,500 is still a bit too low for me.

Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
