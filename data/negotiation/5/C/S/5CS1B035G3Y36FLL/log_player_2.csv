{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, there's potential to get an even better price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  He's hoping to leverage Alice's desire to sell the product and make a profit, while also keeping the price below his maximum budget.  If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer in the next round based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he might be able to get a slightly lower price, the risk of continuing the negotiation and ending up buying from John for $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid potential delays and uncertainty."
