Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to Bob. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $1,400,000}

This is a 7% discount from the product's value to Bob, which I hope will be attractive enough for him to consider accepting. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Considering the product's value to Bob, I think I can do better than $1,300,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": $1,350,000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer I previously decided on:

{""product_price"": $1,350,000}

This is a 10% discount from the product's value to Bob, which I hope will be more appealing to him than his initial offer. Let's see how he responds!"
