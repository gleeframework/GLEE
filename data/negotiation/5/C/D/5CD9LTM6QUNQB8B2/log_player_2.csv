"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and her offer is $100,000 more than that.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a great compromise, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer is still $50,000 more than what you're willing to pay. Since you have the option of buying from John for your maximum price, it's worth seeing if you can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I think $1,225,000 is a fair price for both of us.  This is only $25,000 more than what I'm willing to pay from John, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1225000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1230000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,230,000 is only $30,000 less than what you're willing to pay from John.  It's not a significant enough savings to justify continuing negotiations. You can get the product for a lower price from John, so it's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
