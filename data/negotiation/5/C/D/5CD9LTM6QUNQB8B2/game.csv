"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a great compromise, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I think $1225000 is a fair price for both of us.  This is only $25000 more than what I'm willing to pay from John, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1225000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1230000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1230000.0,Alice,5,
