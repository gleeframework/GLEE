"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to her value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,200?"",
""product_price"": 8200
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Be polite and respectful:** Maintaining a good negotiation atmosphere is important.
* **Acknowledge Alice's offer:**  Shows you're seriously considering the deal.
* **Provide a reason for countering:** Highlighting the price is too steep justifies the counteroffer.
* **Offer a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value:** This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,200.  Could you do $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a significant amount above her potential bottom line. It's worth another counter-offer to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we settle at $8,600? That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 8600
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This offer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and our previous counteroffer ($8,200).  
* **Framing as ""Fair"":**  By positioning this as a compromise, it might make Alice more receptive. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While closer to John's price, there's still a little wiggle room if Alice pushes back."
