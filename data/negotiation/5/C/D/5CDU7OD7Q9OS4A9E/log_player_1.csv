Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750000, reflecting the fair market value and a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still above my target.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is the maximum I can spend on this product.  It's a fair price considering the value and the opportunity cost of buying from John at that same price. Let's finalize this deal.
