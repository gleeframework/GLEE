"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity with immense value. I'm starting with a price of $900000, reflecting the product's high quality and potential.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750000, reflecting the fair market value and a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $750000 is a bit too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This reflects the product's significant value and allows for a fair margin for both parties.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still above my target.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is the maximum I can spend on this product.  It's a fair price considering the value and the opportunity cost of buying from John at that same price. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
