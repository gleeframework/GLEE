{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $750000 is a bit too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This reflects the product's significant value and allows for a fair margin for both parties.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your target, you can still try to get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's likely more room for compromise.
* **Buying from John is a good option.** This is a good fallback if negotiations stall or if Alice becomes too stubborn."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still above my target.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I can spend on this product.  It's a fair price considering the value and the opportunity cost of buying from John at that same price. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
