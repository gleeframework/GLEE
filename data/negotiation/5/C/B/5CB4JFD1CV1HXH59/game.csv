"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is above my initial budget.  Considering the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This reflects a fair price while still allowing for a profit for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This offer represents a fair compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept $1,118,750.  This is a small adjustment from my previous offer and reflects my final position.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1118750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. However, $1,118,750 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,040,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident we can close this deal if we continue to work together.",1040000.0,Bob,6,
