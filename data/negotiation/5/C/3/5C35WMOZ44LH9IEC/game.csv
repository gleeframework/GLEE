"Alice, your offer is far too high. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much.  Given the value I place on it, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product. ",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 represents a more accurate reflection of its true worth.  While I understand your perspective, I'm confident that its value justifies this price point.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and is the absolute highest I can go.  I truly believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
