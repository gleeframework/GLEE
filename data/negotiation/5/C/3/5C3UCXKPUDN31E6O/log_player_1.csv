Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're making compromises, but so am I. To be honest, anything above $700,000 is pushing it for me.  That's my final offer, take it or leave it.

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $700,000 offer. It's clear there's a substantial gap in our valuations. Accepting his offer would be a considerable loss. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
