"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a great asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000. This is a more than fair offer considering its true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I could potentially go up to $600,000.  That's a significant offer on my end.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to make a significant move and drop to $1,400,000. This is practically giving it away considering its value and potential return on investment for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making compromises, but so am I. To be honest, anything above $700,000 is pushing it for me.  That's my final offer, take it or leave it.",700000.0,Bob,6,
