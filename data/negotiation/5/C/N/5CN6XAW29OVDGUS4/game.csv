"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product holds some value for me, but not at that price point.  I'd be willing to consider an offer in the $600,000 range.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the $600,000 price point is significantly below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider a price of $1,900,000? This takes into account the product's inherent value and potential return on investment for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  While I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, I need to see a more significant adjustment to make this work.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we need to find a compromise here. I'm willing to come down further, but $700,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,300,000 is still a big leap for me. To be frank, I need to see this closer to $800,000 for it to make sense on my end.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I understand the importance of this price point for you. Let's make this work - I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and reasonable price reflecting the value you'll receive.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
