Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product holds some value for me, but not at that price point.  I'd be willing to consider an offer in the $600,000 range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
