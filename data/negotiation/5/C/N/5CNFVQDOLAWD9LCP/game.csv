"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $850,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us very close to a deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
