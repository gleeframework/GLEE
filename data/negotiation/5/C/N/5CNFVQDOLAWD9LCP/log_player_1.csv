Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $850,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us very close to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and while we're getting closer, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.  With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I'll be able to secure a price I'm happy with.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
