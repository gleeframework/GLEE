"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels like a fairer starting point.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. That said, $1,000,000 is still a significant jump from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
