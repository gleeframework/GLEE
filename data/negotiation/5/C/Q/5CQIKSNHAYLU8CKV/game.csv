"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects both our needs.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
