"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer of $1,000,000. While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price. It's important to remember that Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, so he can afford to keep negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product and what you're willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's within Bob's budget and significantly lower than the initial asking price. While there's still some room for negotiation, it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and might risk losing the deal entirely. 

Bob should accept this offer to secure the product at a good price, as continuing to negotiate might push the price closer to John's asking price of $1,500,000."
