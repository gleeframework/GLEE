"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $95. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $100 to John, which is your maximum limit.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and potentially negotiate with her further or buy from John at your maximum price."
