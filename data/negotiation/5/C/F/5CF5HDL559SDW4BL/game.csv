"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
