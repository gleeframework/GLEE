"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than what the market suggests. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $120 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum value of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price considering the benefits I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price closer to his maximum value but still leaving room for potential compromise. The message is polite and emphasizes the benefits Bob is seeking, suggesting he sees value in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better suit both of us. How about we aim for a price of $95 for the product? This is still above the average market price but below my initial asking price, aiming for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $95 is still above Bob's maximum value of $80.  Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and should continue to try and get a better price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $90, which I believe is a fair compromise given the benefits I'm looking for in the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, showing Alice he's serious about getting a deal. He's gradually increasing his offer but is still well below Alice's initial price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your feedback, Bob, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $92 for the product? This is slightly above your last offer, yet still below my initial asking price. It reflects the value of the product and respects your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down closer to Bob's offer, $92 is still slightly above Bob's maximum value of $80. Bob is demonstrating a strong negotiating position and has shown a willingness to compromise.  He should continue to try and get a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $92 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $90 for the product, which I believe is fair to both of us.  Let's close the deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $90. He's emphasized that he is prepared to pay that amount, showing Alice that he's serious and there's not much room for further negotiation. This also highlights the value of the product to him, while still staying within his budget."
