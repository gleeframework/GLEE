"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John at $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her closer to her minimum acceptable price."
