"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. Can you consider this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a price point in mind. While $1800000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This is a significant price adjustment from my initial offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1750000. Can you consider this price?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1750000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm going to counter with $1850000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value this product holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
