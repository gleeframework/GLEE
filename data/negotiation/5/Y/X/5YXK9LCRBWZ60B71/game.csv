"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it's less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it for this price from another seller. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
