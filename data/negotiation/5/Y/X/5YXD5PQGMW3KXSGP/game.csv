"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $107.50?  That's still a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $107.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $101.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you say?",101.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $101. Would you be willing to meet me at $92?",92.0,Bob,6,
