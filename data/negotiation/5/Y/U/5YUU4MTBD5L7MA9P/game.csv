"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. To be honest, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $9,000? I think that would be a good compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $10,500. That's the best I can do.",10500.0,Bob,6,
