Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. "", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) as possible.
* **Beat Bob's Valuation:** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value ($12,000) is unlikely to work. He might try to negotiate further down.
* **Urgency and Alternative:** By setting a high price and implying I have another buyer (John), I create a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might encourage Bob to accept before losing the opportunity. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, it's worth trying to get the higher price from Bob first."
