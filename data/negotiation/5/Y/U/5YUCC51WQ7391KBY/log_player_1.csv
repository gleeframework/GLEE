{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  He sees value in the product, making him more likely to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate upwards if necessary.
* **It leaves room for a counteroffer:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my asking price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your proposed price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000?  This would still be a great deal for both of us, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob a reason to consider my counteroffer and potentially come up in price.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room if Bob wants to push even higher, allowing for another round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above your proposed price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not near what the product is worth to me.  I'm at a point where I'm confident that I can secure a significantly better deal with John.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and I don't want to risk losing that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
