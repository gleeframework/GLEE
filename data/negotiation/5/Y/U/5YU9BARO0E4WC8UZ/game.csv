"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the product's value, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000? This reflects the worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $750,000.  That's a significant offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, we need to bridge the gap. Let's settle this at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a fair price considering its value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to close this gap.  While I appreciate your final offer, I'm only comfortable going up to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
