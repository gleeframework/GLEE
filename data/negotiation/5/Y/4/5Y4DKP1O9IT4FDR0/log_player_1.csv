{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, this price point ensures a profit well above my minimum ($800,000).

By aiming high but leaving room for discussion, I increase the likelihood of securing a deal that is highly profitable for me while still being attractive to Bob."
