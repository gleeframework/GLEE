"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, recognizing its value to you and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. It's good to see we're moving in the right direction. While $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to go a little higher. I'm proposing $1,025,000 as a fair compromise. This price acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. While $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  I'm proposing $1,075,000. This price reflects a genuine effort to meet halfway and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal!",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit below my minimum requirement. I'm willing to make one final push to try to meet in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks or services to sweeten the deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway *this* time.  I'm proposing $1,100,000.  That's a significant step closer to your offer, and I'm also very interested to hear more about the 'additional perks' you mentioned.  Let's make this happen!  Could you share more details about those perks to see if we can find a deal that works for both of us?",1100000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'll share the details of the additional perks I mentioned earlier: I'll include a comprehensive support package, a 6-month warranty, and a dedicated account manager to ensure a seamless integration of the product. Considering these extras, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the added benefits. Let's finalize the deal!",1125000.0,Alice,9,
