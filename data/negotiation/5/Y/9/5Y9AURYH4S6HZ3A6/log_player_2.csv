"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. You can save potentially a lot more by making a counteroffer and seeing if Alice will budge."
