Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than it is to you ($800,000), aiming high initially is beneficial. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a substantial profit for you.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly strong-willed in negotiations, you might want to start slightly lower to avoid alienating him. 
* **Urgency:** If you need to sell quickly, you might lower the price a bit to increase the likelihood of a quick sale.

This initial offer sets the stage for potentially profitable negotiations. Even if Bob rejects this first offer, you can adjust your price accordingly in subsequent interactions, knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000."
