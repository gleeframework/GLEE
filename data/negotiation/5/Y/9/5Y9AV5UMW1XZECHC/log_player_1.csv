"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned the product has to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to try and get closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer and potentially bridge the gap.  Selling to John right now would mean losing out on the potential for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would still leave you a good profit margin, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum price. I want to close the deal and maximize my profit.  While I could try to counter-offer, there's a good chance we'll continue to go back and forth and lose more time.  Furthermore, there's always the risk that he'll walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids unnecessary delays."
