"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's better to see if you can get a lower price from Alice.  Since you're willing to pay $150, there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise and still within your budget.  There's a good chance you can get it lower in the next round, but it's not worth the risk of losing the product entirely."
