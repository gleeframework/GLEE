Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's becoming clear that Alice is not going to budge significantly on her price. She's gone up to $13,000, indicating a reluctance to meet near our target.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 rather than risk the negotiations failing and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
