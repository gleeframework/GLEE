"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll agree this is a good value for a product that's worth so much to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
