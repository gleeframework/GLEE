"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we set the product price at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I think $12,500 is still quite high for me. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us considering the product's value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",12000.0,Alice,5,
