Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. It's also more than halfway towards Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it more attractive to him. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value the product offers to Bob. It leaves the door open for negotiation and doesn't come across as too aggressive. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high offer, I'm attempting to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm also mindful of the fact that Bob could reject the offer. If he does, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as a fallback option."
