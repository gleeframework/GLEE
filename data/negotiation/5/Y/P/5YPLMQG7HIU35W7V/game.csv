"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1500000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe the value it will bring to you far outweighs the cost.  Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can't refuse given the potential this product holds. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is a fair price that balances my needs with the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
