"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is above my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to my initial offer, hopefully encouraging Bob to come up a bit more."
