"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly appealing, the value of this product is significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of offering $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
