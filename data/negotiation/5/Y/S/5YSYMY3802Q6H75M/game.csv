"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me right now.  How about we start at $600,000 and see where we go from there?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This still gives you a good opportunity to profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the potential profit I'm looking at.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. Let's try $900,000. It's a good middle ground,  and I'm confident it will allow you to make a strong profit.  Let's get this deal done!",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle at $750,000? This allows me a decent margin while still being a good deal for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $850,000? This would give you a good return on your investment, and it's closer to my desired price.  It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's seal the deal!",850000.0,Alice,7,
