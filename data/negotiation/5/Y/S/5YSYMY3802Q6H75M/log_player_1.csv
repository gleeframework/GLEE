{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me right now.  How about we start at $600,000 and see where we go from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as it is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This still gives you a good opportunity to profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the potential profit I'm looking at. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a compromise closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. Let's try $900,000. It's a good middle ground,  and I'm confident it will allow you to make a strong profit.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle at $750,000? This allows me a decent margin while still being a good deal for you.
