"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This still gives you a good opportunity to profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $850,000? This would give you a good return on your investment, and it's closer to my desired price.  It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's seal the deal!

It's time to cut the negotiations with Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much further:**  She's consistently aiming for a price above $800,000.  
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** You know you can get the product for $800,000, which is your upper limit.
* **Saving time and potential hassle:**  Continuing with Alice might lead to a slightly better deal, but it's not guaranteed. Going with John secures the product now."
