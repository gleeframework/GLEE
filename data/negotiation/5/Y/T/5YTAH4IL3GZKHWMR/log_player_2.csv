"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's also below your maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You're better off continuing to negotiate and pushing for a lower price.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's time to try and find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to demonstrate your willingness to negotiate while remaining within your budget.  It's a smaller increase from your previous offer, suggesting you're getting closer to your limit."
