"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
