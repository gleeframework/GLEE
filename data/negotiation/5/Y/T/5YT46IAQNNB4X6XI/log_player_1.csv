Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum value of $800,000.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to negotiate further from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum value, and I'm confident that I can't get a better price in subsequent rounds.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the sale."
