Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $1,500,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity!"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, you can start with a significantly higher offer to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,500,000 offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $1,200,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, given your fallback option with John, this strategy aims for the highest potential gain."
