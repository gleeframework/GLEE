# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $135 for it. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you is $120, and it allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.
