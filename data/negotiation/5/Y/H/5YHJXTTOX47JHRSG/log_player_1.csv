Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John allows me to be more firm in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm Price:**  $11,000 is still above Bob's offer, but closer to a point where we might find common ground. It's also a good compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Finding a Solution:** I use language like ""middle ground"" to suggest a collaborative approach.  

**Important Note:** While John's offer is great, I'm not ready to close the deal yet. Bob might be willing to go slightly higher, and I want to explore that possibility before committing to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and offer $10,000.  I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While it's closer to my initial price, I'm not willing to compromise further. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There's a risk that continued negotiations with Bob will lead to a stalemate, and I might lose valuable time and potentially miss out on a better offer.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John. This is a much safer and more lucrative option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

I'm confident that John's offer will lead to a more favorable outcome."
