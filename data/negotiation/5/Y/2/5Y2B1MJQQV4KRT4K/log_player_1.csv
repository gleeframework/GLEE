"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but $100 is not acceptable at this time.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $102.5 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll try to get a little closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $102.50 just isn't enough for me. Let's meet in the middle again.  How about $105? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to suggest $103.75 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm getting closer to my target price with Bob's offer, but it's still not enough. I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  I want to see if I can get him up a little more before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $104.25. That's a great deal for you, and it's just a small step away from my target price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 104.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose $104 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is only $1 away from my counteroffer, I've already spent 7 rounds negotiating.  While it is possible that we could come to an agreement in the next round or two, I don't want to risk losing any more time. John is offering a guaranteed $120, and it's time to move on."
