Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John. This is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, which is what John is offering. I will counteroffer and see if I can find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is still higher than what Bob offered but closer to what I'd accept. This shows flexibility while still remaining profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price to $105, hoping that this will finally be acceptable to Bob. It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but still above my minimum."
