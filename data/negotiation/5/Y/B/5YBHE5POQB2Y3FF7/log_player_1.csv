Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Create Urgency:** Offering a ""special price"" implies scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, you can slightly reduce the price, still making a profit above your minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
