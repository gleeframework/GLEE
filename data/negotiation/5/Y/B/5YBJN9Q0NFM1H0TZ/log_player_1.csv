"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I signal that I'm open to negotiation, fostering a positive atmosphere for continued discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John at $800,000 ensures I don't lose money, but I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's continue this negotiation and find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $900,000 to $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still hold firm on getting a price close to my minimum.
* **Reinforce value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Focus on finding common ground:** I emphasize finding a mutually beneficial solution, keeping the negotiation positive and encouraging further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $825,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to close this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $825,000 is just $25,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Time is of the essence:** I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's important to close the deal before my 10 rounds are up.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer $850,000, there's always a chance for future negotiation or a better offer down the line.

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
