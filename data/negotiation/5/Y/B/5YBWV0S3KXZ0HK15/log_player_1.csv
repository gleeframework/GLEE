Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $15,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds it too high. This increases the chances of closing a deal above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value justification:**  The message hints at the product's value, which might make Bob more receptive to a higher price. 

It's important to note that this is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you know about Bob's potential interest, you could adjust the initial offer."
