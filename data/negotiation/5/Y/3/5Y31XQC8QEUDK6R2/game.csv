"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $115? That's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we try $125? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $125 is close, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $118?  That's really the most I can do.",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $118 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $118, which would be $121.50. That's the best I can do.",121.5,Alice,7,
