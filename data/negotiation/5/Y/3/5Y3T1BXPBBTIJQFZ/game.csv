"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a minimum of $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. My initial offer is $1250000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1250000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your stated minimum value, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I need to ensure I receive a fair return. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a compromise that still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1100000.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1050000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
