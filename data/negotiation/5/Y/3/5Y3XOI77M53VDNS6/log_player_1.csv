Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there's a good chance he'll be willing to negotiate. 

By starting with a higher price, I set a strong initial position and maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired price point. I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob, so I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a price I'm comfortable with.  It's also likely to be appealing to Bob, as it's closer to his desired price point. By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while also trying to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired price point.  Since I'm only a few hundred dollars away from my minimum, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. It's better to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $10,000.  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob in the next round, and time is a factor."
