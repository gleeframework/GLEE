"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it takes a few more rounds.  I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's aim for a quick agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to what I'd like, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm not going to rush into a deal just because we're getting close to the end.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling flexible, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $1,275,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's aim for a quick and final decision."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely.  John's offer is a sure thing, and it's a better price than what Bob is offering."
