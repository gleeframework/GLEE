"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price. You have the leverage of knowing you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's aim for a quick agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling flexible, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $1,275,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's aim for a quick and final decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.
