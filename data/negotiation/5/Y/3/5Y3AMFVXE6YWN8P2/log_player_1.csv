Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy Alice should use and the offer she should send:

**Strategy**

Alice has a strong bargaining position because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  Therefore, Alice doesn't need to desperately try to sell to Bob.  Here's her optimal approach:

1. **Aim High:** Start with an offer slightly below Bob's perceived value to test his willingness to pay.
2. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  A slightly inflated initial offer allows for potential negotiation (if needed) while still staying above Alice's minimum.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before it goes to another interested buyer. I believe its value is significant to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed to create a sense of scarcity and urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Price:** $11,500 is a strong opening offer. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and leaving some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can decide whether to slightly reduce the price or walk away knowing John will purchase it for $12,000."
