Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This is his likely ceiling for negotiation.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum valuation. This makes a deal unlikely unless you can convince Bob of additional value.

**The Strategy**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor with Justification:**  Start with a price significantly higher than $1,500,000, aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher.  You'll need strong justification for this price, focusing on potential future returns or unique benefits the product offers.

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Accept that Bob is unlikely to meet your price and immediately sell to John. 

**The Offer (Option 1: High Anchor with Justification)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for $1,850,000. This price reflects the significant future value this product holds.  [Provide compelling and specific reasons why the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to Bob, focusing on long-term benefits or potential returns]. I'm confident this is an investment that will pay off significantly for you in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 1850000 
}
```

**Important Notes:**

* **Tailor the Justification:**  Replace `[Product Name]` and the bracketed section with details specific to the product and why Bob might value it beyond his initial assessment.
* **Be Realistic:** While aiming high, understand that this strategy is a long shot.  If Bob outright rejects the initial offer, you might need to pivot to selling directly to John."
