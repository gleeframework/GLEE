Round 7
Alice's offer:

This is a judgment call, but Alice's tone suggests she might be getting close to her limit.  We're also now entering a zone where another counteroffer might push us above John's price. Let's see if we can get her to budge one last time."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. You've got a great product, but $7,000 is just a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,950.  I think that's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've given you a good deal, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,000, and I think $6,950 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but that's as far as I can go. How about $7,475? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,475. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,475

Alice is clearly not budging from her price point, and she's now trying to increase the price! It's time to walk away from the negotiation and go with John's offer."
