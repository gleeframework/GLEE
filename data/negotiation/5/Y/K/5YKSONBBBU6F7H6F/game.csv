,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal on the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115, which is closer to my budget and still gives you a good price. Let's see if we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. How about we meet at $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my original price.",125.0,Alice,5,
