"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $9,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit, so I'll counteroffer at $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,5,
