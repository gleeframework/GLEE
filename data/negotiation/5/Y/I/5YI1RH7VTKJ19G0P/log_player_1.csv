"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" without revealing specifics, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While the price is high, I'm framing it as a ""fair price for both of us"" to maintain a positive tone and encourage negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, I secure a much higher profit than selling to John.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob increased his offer, $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Bob's message suggests he has some flexibility in his budget. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I can try to negotiate a price closer to my target. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which acts as a safety net. I'm not ready to settle for that price yet, as I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer carefully, and I believe there's still a gap between our valuations. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of this product and its potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Above Minimum, But Reasonable:**  The new price of $1,900,000 remains significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) but is closer to Bob's counteroffer. This leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits for Bob's business, subtly anchoring the price to its worth rather than just numbers.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Signal Seriousness:**  By making a significant move, I'm showing Bob I'm serious about finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
2. **Test Bob's Limit:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how much further Bob is willing to go. His response will determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Upside:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer. Pushing him too hard might make him walk away from the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now rather than prolonging negotiations means I can receive the payment and potentially reinvest it sooner.

While accepting Bob's offer means missing out on a potential $100,000, it's a relatively small amount compared to the overall price and the risks of continuing the negotiation. It's a strategically sound decision to secure a substantial profit now."
