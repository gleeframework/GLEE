"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,500, but I'm still a little over budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get the product within my price range.",13000.0,Bob,4,
