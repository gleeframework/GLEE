Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's valuation:** This ensures Bob will be motivated to negotiate.
* **Is below your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to your minimum. 
* **Is a clear and concise message:**  This keeps the negotiation focused.

This offer strategy allows for potential negotiation, but also gives you the option to go with John's offer if Bob isn't willing to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired earnings.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, as Bob is already willing to pay more than his initial valuation.
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting,  further negotiation with Bob might yield a better outcome, especially if I can get closer to my $14,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still looking to get the best deal possible.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. It's closer to your asking price and still a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offers.
* **Close to my goal:** While I wanted $13,500,  $13,000 is still within my acceptable range and a significant improvement over his initial offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but the time and effort required might not be worth the potential gain. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $15,000.

Considering all factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best decision in this scenario."
