Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits of the product for Bob and highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's value, I'm likely to get a counteroffer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides a solid backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below the value Bob perceives the product to have ($80). 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John is the fallback:** If negotiations with Bob continue to be unsuccessful, selling to John guarantees my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $60 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $85 is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly closer to his perceived value and my minimum price. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" and ""value"" aspects to keep Bob engaged.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not going below $85 at this point, knowing John is a fallback option if needed."
