You can still do better than $130. You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice only values the product at $80.  Let's try one more counteroffer."

At this point, Alice is offering $140, which is close to your maximum. You can either accept and pay $140 or go with John for $150. It's a small difference, and while you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much further. It's best to avoid the risk of further negotiation and simply buy from John."
