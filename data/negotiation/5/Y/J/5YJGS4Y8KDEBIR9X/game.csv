"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $132.50?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $125, so how about we settle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about $135?  That's only a small step up from your offer, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I've got a limit of $128. Can we meet at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
