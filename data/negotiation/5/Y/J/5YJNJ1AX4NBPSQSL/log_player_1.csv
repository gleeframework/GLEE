**Reasoning:**

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 is still a significant profit ($225,000) over our guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000. 

Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer as the only option."
