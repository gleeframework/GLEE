"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly cheaper than John's $1,500,000 offer. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
