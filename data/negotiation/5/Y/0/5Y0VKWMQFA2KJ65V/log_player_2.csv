"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. This is a special deal considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price and is a good deal.  It's better to accept and save the money rather than risk a counteroffer being rejected or a longer negotiation process."
