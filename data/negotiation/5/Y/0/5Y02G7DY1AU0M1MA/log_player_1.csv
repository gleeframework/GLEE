Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000 before I consider other offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **High but Justifiable Price:**  $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but the message emphasizes the product's value and my confidence in it, aiming to influence his perception.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other offers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
