"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You're willing to pay no more than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you an opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $10,500?  It's a good compromise and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise.  This price still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $11,500 is closer to your limit, you're still comfortable with John's offer of $10,000. It's the best deal available and avoids further negotiation."
