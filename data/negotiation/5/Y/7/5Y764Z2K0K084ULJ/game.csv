"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $10,500?  It's a good compromise and allows us both to make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise.  This price still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,3,
