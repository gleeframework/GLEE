"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still feel like I can get a better deal. I have a few rounds left and I'm not in a rush to sell to John, so I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 still isn't quite there for me. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to go down to $11,250. It's a fair compromise and I think we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $11,250 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Even though we're getting closer, $10,750 is still below my minimum price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next few rounds. If things don't improve, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $12,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement, but if not, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I only have a few rounds left. To avoid the risk of ending up with nothing, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's still a good deal and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
