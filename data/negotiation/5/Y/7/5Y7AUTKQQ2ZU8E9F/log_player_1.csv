"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""fair reflection of its worth"") makes the offer seem less arbitrary.
* **Open for Discussion:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm encouraging a dialogue and signaling flexibility. 

My goal is to anchor the negotiation at a high point while remaining open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge this gap. Accepting his offer now would leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that meets Bob halfway between his offer ($900,000) and my previous asking price ($1,100,000). 
* **Highlighting Value:**  By reiterating the product's ""true potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value he sees in it.
* **Direct Proposal:**  I'm phrasing this counteroffer as a direct suggestion (""how about we agree..."") to encourage a quicker resolution. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and securing the deal with Bob before the negotiation stalls or he loses interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I still think $1,000,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob has signaled this is his ""final offer.""  

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away entirely, leaving me with John's guaranteed $800,000.
* **Solid Profit:**  $950,000 is a significant profit margin, even if it's not the absolute maximum.
* **Time Value:**  Securing the deal now saves time and potential complications in further rounds. 

Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk at this stage in the negotiation."
