"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from this product, while allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
