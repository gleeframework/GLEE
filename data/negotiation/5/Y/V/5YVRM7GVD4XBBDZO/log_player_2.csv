"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  While I can't disclose all the details at this time, I can tell you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant price reduction from what it's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is clearly motivated to sell.** Her message focuses heavily on persuading you of the product's value *to you*, suggesting she needs you to believe it's worth much more than her own valuation. 
* **You have a fallback option.** John provides a price ceiling. You'll never pay more than $1,500,000, so there's no risk of losing the product entirely.
* **Room for negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're a serious buyer but also cost-conscious. This gives you leverage to potentially negotiate a better price closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
