Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its actual value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
