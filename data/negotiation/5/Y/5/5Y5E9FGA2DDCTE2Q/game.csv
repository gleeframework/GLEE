"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its actual value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this product. Let's find some common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still not a price I can accept. I'm prepared to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely interested in buying. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a significant move on my end, and it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,100,000 is still not enough for me. I'm firm on my last offer of $1,125,000.  It's a fair price for a valuable product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
