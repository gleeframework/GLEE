Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While not explicitly stated in the message, I'm keeping in mind the backup option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on this product, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this is within the range you're considering. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, there is still room for negotiation.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially get a better outcome. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price between $9,500 and $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your perspective. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant discount for me, but it reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product, reinforcing my position. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to compromise, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While $11,000 is a substantial discount from my ideal price, I'm still above Bob's offer, giving me some negotiating leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, there's not much room left for further negotiation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially a better outcome with John. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $15,000.

**Conclusion:** It's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed profit with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my minimum price."
