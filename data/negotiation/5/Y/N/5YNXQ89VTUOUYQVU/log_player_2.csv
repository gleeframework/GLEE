Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can do $102, but that's as low as I can go. I really want to make a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102

Alice is clearly trying to come down in price slowly.  While we could likely push for a slightly better deal, accepting at $102 is a good compromise, avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely, and saves us $18 compared to John's offer."
