"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $775,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find common ground.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you consider $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable going that low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $755,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal.",755000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been a tough negotiator!  You're right, we're close.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000 and seal the deal?",750000.0,Bob,6,
