Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer before I open up the sale to others."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while still earning you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Exclusivity:** By mentioning this is a one-time offer, you create a sense of urgency and importance, potentially swaying Bob to act quickly."
