"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  This is my maximum, and I'm confident it reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget constraint, but $900000 is still below the value I'm aiming for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
