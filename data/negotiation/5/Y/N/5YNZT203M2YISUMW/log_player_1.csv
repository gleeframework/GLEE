Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit lower than $150 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at exactly $150 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
