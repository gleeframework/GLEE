"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'm prepared to come down to $900,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, but it leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $725,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still significantly below the product's value.  To show my willingness to find a solution, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me to get a fair return.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I need you to meet me a little closer. Would you consider $775,000?  That's my final offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but  $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,7,
