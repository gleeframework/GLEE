# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it at the price of $1,350,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. Bob can still get the product for a better price by either negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
