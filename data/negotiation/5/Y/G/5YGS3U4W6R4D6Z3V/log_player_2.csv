"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and potential impact, I propose a price of $950,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?"",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. It sets a strong anchor for me as the buyer.
* **Respectful Tone:** I want to maintain a positive relationship with Alice and acknowledge the product's value, even while negotiating firmly.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to buy for significantly less than John's $800,000 backup option. This offer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to move towards my price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $850,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John:** Alice's offer is lower, but still above my fallback option of buying from John for $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are several rounds left, and Alice clearly signaled willingness to negotiate with her counteroffer. I believe I can get the price closer to my target. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While there's a risk Alice might not go much lower, I'm willing to take that chance for the potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000?"",
""product_price"": 785000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm increasing my offer but still staying below John's price. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying while keeping the pressure on her.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing suggests fairness and encourages Alice to make a similar-sized move toward my desired range.
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds left, I'm aiming for a price that's agreeable for both of us to avoid a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Difference:**  Alice's offer is only $25,000 above my guaranteed option with John. 
* **Limited Upside:**  With half the rounds remaining, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price significantly. Even if she came down a little, the potential savings are not worth the risk of the deal falling through entirely.
* **Certainty:** Buying from John guarantees I get the product at the best price I'm willing to pay. It eliminates uncertainty and the risk of ending the negotiation without the product."
