"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $155 is still a bit high for me, how about $150? That's the price I could get it for elsewhere, and I'd prefer to do business with you.",150.0,Bob,4,
