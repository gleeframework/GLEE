"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the market value, I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000 for the product.
