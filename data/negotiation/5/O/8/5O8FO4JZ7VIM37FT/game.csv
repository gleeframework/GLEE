"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,950,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate the effort you're making. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I value your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a very fair price considering my budget and the product's value. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
