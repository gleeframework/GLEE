{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my value than Bob's, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for some back-and-forth.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John's offer as a backup allows me to walk away if negotiations with Bob become too unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $850,000 is still significantly less than what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room to negotiate, as Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial valuation.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to reject Bob's offer and potentially secure a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique value of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by reducing my price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential for his business, hoping to encourage him to pay more.
* **Mutually Beneficial Tone:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a lower price than my initial offer, it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I believe this price reflects a good balance between the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $900,000.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John's offer provides a buffer and allows me to hold out for a better price from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $875,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of my target price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price point.
* **Focus on Mutual Solution:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, building a collaborative tone. 
* **Last Stand Before John:**  This is my final counteroffer before potentially selling to John, increasing pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but no more. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Enough:** Bob's offer is just $10,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Further Negotiation Likely Unfruitful:**  Bob seems firm on his price, and further negotiation could drag out the process and ultimately result in a price I'm not happy with.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids further time wasted on potentially fruitless negotiations.

While Bob's offer is close to what I'm aiming for, the potential for a more favorable deal with John outweighs the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
