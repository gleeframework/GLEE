"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify spending more than $500,000. Let me know if that works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, my valuation is significantly higher than your initial offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your valuation is higher, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I can go up to $650,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to be mindful of my investment and I believe this offer represents a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Let's find a middle ground. While your offer is still below my initial assessment, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its potential.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $1,600,000 is still a big gap.  I can offer $750,000 as my final offer.  I believe this is a very fair price, given the market and my own budget constraints. If we can't agree on this, I may need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
