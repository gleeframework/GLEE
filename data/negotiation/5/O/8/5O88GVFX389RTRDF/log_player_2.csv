"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly before even considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify spending more than $500,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
 ""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Signals strong interest:**  Even though the price is low, explicitly stating interest might encourage Alice to engage further. 
* **Establishes a low anchor:** This starting point aims to pull down the overall negotiation range. 
* **Leaves room for movement:**  While $500,000 is the target, there's space to increase the offer during subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, my valuation is significantly higher than your initial offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the true value and potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still far too high, even though she came down in price.  We need to continue negotiating to bring the price closer to a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your valuation is higher, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I can go up to $650,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to be mindful of my investment and I believe this offer represents a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** By increasing the offer, we signal that we're serious about finding common ground.
* **Remains firm on the budget:**  The message clearly states the $650,000 is the maximum, setting a boundary.
* **Justification:**  Giving a reason (budget constraints) adds weight to the offer and makes it harder to dismiss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Let's find a middle ground. While your offer is still below my initial assessment, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still too far from a reasonable point. It's time to increase the pressure a bit and signal that we might walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $1,600,000 is still a big gap.  I can offer $750,000 as my final offer.  I believe this is a very fair price, given the market and my own budget constraints. If we can't agree on this, I may need to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

Strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Final offer:**  By stating this is the ""final offer,"" we introduce a sense of urgency and signal a potential breaking point in the negotiation.
* **Slight increase, but firm:** The offer increases slightly to show we're still trying, but not significantly, keeping us well below our maximum.
* **Mentioning alternatives:**  The subtle reference to ""other options"" reminds Alice of our backup plan (John), adding weight to our position."
