``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Clear communication:** I'm stating my price clearly and providing a rationale behind it. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the uniqueness and potential value of the product to pique Bob's interest.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it would mean no profit for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob or secure a better deal with John.
* **Maintaining my position:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore alternative options.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I will counteroffer with a price that is more favorable to me while still being within a reasonable range for Bob.  
* **Monitor John's availability:** While I focus on negotiating with Bob, I'll also check with John to see if he's still interested in purchasing the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,500,000. This price reflects the product's unique value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer but lower than my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product and highlight the potential benefits for both of us.
* **Open dialogue:** I invite Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging further discussion and a potential agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I will carefully consider Bob's counteroffer or rejection to determine my next steps.
* **Continue monitoring John:** I'll stay in touch with John to assess his continued interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1500000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation progress:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my needs. However, I'm seeing progress in the negotiation.
* **Seeking a better price:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price from Bob or potentially even a better offer from John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer, aiming to close the gap.
* **Keep John updated:**  I will keep John informed about the negotiation progress to gauge his continued interest."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,300,000 just isn't enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,400,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, but allows for some wiggle room.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:**  I acknowledge the negotiation is progressing, but I'm determined to secure a price closer to my minimum or explore alternative options.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob or potentially a better offer from John.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again and offer the product for $1,375,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and represents a fair price for both of us.

* **Open to the possibility of John:** While I'm actively negotiating with Bob, I'm also keeping John in the loop and gauging his interest to create competitive pressure.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next move to determine my next steps. 
* **Maintain open communication with John:** I'll keep John informed about the progress and continue to evaluate his potential offer as a backup option."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1375000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1400000. I think this is the maximum I can go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Bob has increased his offer to $1,400,000, which is only $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant amount of progress in the negotiation.
* **Time constraint:** With only three rounds left, it's important to consider the time factor. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that I might not reach a satisfactory price with Bob, and John might withdraw his offer. 
* **Reasonable profit:** Accepting $1,400,000 would still give me a significant profit and secure a sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **Secure the deal:** I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction to ensure a successful sale.
* **Maintain communication with John:** I will thank John for his interest and inform him that the product has been sold to Bob."
