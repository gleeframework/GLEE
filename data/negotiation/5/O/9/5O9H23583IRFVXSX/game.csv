,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1500000. This price reflects the product's unique value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1500000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $1300000 just isn't enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1400000.  This price still reflects the product's value, but allows for some wiggle room.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1350000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider my offer?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  However, $1350000 is still a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again and offer the product for $1375000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and represents a fair price for both of us.  It's a price that allows us to close this deal and move forward. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1375000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1400000. I think this is the maximum I can go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,8,
