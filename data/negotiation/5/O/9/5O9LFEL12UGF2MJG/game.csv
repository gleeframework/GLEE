"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. Let me know if that works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this product.",16500.0,Alice,5,
