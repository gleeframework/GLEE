"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? It's a fair compromise, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
