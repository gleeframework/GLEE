"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
