Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so you should aim for more than that with Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Keep it simple:** A straightforward offer keeps the communication clear and focuses on the potential deal. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might try to negotiate further down, or he might reject the offer outright. However, this approach maximizes your potential profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider."
