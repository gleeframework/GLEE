"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. Let's start the conversation!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $850,000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This still represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $925,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  How about we settle at $975,000? This offer reflects a significant value for you, and we can finalize the deal quickly.",975000.0,Alice,5,
