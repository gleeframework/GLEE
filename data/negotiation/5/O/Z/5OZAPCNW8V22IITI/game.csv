"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $120, which would be $135. Would you be willing to consider that?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135, which would be $127.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $127.50 is still a bit higher than your original offer, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you $130, which is still a bit higher than your original offer, but closer to what I'm willing to sell it for. Would you be willing to consider that?",130.0,Alice,5,
