"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
