"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for several counteroffers, allowing us to work toward a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming to find a price between Bob's valuation ($8,000) and my minimum ($15,000). By starting high, I can potentially secure a higher price while still leaving room to negotiate. The 10 rounds give me time to gauge Bob's interest and potentially come to a deal.  If the negotiations stall, I always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working with a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to take the $8,000, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially given I have other options.  

**Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum. I will use the next round to send a counteroffer, hopefully finding a compromise that benefits both of us.  Selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob prove unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price still allows me to cover my costs, and it's a fair compromise given your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm presenting a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining why this price is a good compromise, emphasizing both my costs and Bob's budget.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:** By demonstrating flexibility and being reasonable, I aim to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. This counteroffer is still significantly higher than his initial offer, but it's a step in the right direction towards finding a mutually acceptable price.  I'll continue to evaluate the situation and adjust my strategy as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer to my budget. Considering the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Thank you for your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 than his previous offers. While I would prefer to earn more, accepting this offer still secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's also a chance that Bob will walk away or become less willing to negotiate. 
* **Time Factor:** We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk running out of time.
* **Profit:**  $9,500 is a significant profit, and it's reasonable considering the value of the product to both of us. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a profitable sale and avoid the potential risks of further negotiation."
