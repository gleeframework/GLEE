Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer aims to maximize potential profit while still having a fallback option with John. Here's the reasoning:

* **$1,500,000 is a significant markup:** This represents a 50% profit over John's offer, a substantial gain.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward is high.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob counters with a lower offer, you have room to negotiate. 

By setting a high price, you incentivize Bob to seriously consider the product's value to him. If he's truly interested and the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to him, he'll likely accept."
