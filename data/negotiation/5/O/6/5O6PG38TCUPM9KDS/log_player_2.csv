"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $17000. This is a fantastic deal, as I know the market value is significantly higher.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.
