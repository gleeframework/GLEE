"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits for Bob's company.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This initial offer allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before I might have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,400,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I'm still interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below my Floor:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired floor of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I have 8 rounds left.  I can likely still secure a better price by counteroffering.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee the $1,500,000, but I'm aiming for more if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $1,400,000.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This is still a significant discount from my original offer and would be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired floor while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Desired Floor:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** I have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **Opportunity Cost of Selling to John:**  While selling to John is guaranteed, I'm still aiming for the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go below $1,500,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This product is truly unique and will bring significant value to your company. I believe it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to the Floor:**  I'm firming up my stance, stating my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focusing on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and its potential benefits for his company.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By emphasizing the minimum, I'm subtly suggesting that if he doesn't accept, I might move on to other buyers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,425,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time and Lowering Offers:** We are in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. Bob is steadily lowering his offers, indicating he is unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk of Further Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter, there is a significant risk that he will walk away, leaving me with no deal.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price and within the range of my initial expectations. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of further negotiation and potential loss is too high. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed value from John."
