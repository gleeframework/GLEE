Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $115 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your $120 minimum, ensuring you profit. 
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:**  It's not so high that Bob will immediately reject it, but it also shows you're not desperate to sell. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is close to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me the best outcome and avoids any further negotiation with Bob."
