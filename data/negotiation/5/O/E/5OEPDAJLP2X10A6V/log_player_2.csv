"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation.  We'll see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $97 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $97 is still above our target price. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $97 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90. How about it?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're holding firm at $90 for now, but the tone remains amicable to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $92 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $92. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer and within our target range."
