"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product. This still leaves some room for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is still below my minimum. Would you consider $9,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within a reasonable range for your budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,5,
