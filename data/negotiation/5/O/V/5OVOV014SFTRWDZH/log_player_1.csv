Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and secure a deal that is beneficial for both of us. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John and be guaranteed $800,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where it's no longer in my best interest to continue negotiating with Bob.  His offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made my final offer.  Selling to John guarantees me a solid $800,000, which is a better outcome than risking another rejection and potentially ending up with nothing."
