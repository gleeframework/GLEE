"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $17,000.  It's a steal considering its value!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's close enough that I want to see if I can negotiate a better price.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $15,500 is a bit too much for me. I can offer $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price and matches John's offer.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation or potentially losing a sale by going to John.  I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
