"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile.  How about we settle on $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $8,800 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,900? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
