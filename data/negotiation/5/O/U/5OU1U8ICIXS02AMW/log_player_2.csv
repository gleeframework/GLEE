"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to inflate the perceived value, $12,000 is still a better price than the $15,000 John is offering. Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,000."
