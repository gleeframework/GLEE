"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on this product and the potential savings you'll get by selling it to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
