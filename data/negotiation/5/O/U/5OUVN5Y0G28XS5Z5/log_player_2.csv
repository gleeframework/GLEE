"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly improve your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on this product and the potential savings you'll get by selling it to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option.  You can get the product for $1,075,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,200,000. There's a good chance you could negotiate further, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
