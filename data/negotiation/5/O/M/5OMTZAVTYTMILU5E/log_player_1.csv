{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum value for the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

I'm counteroffering at $85, which is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and close the deal."

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $82. I believe this price is still reasonable, considering Bob's previous offers and my minimum value."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $80.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, we only have 4 rounds left and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids any further negotiation."
