"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product and Alice is offering it at that price, it makes no sense to negotiate further. Buying from John at that same price is the most logical choice as there's no potential for saving money."
