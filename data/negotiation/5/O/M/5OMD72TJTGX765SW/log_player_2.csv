This offer takes into account the significant worth this product holds for you and aims to provide a fair deal for both parties. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000. This means there is room for negotiation. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
