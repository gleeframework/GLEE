{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $80. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the value difference to Bob ($80 vs. $120) can make the offer seem more appealing, even if it's still above his ideal price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, signaling flexibility.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Keeping John in mind, I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me is $80, I would like to propose a price of $95. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:**  My minimum acceptable price is $100, and Bob's offer of $95 falls below that.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get closer to my desired price.  
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed alternative buyer (John) who is willing to pay $100, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Considering my own costs, $105 would be a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's price but still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  I'm using language like ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and  make it seem like I'm being flexible.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage further negotiation and see if there's room for another compromise. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still mindful of John's offer of $100, so I'm not willing to go below $105."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm aiming to keep the cost as low as possible. Considering the value of the product to me is $80, I would like to propose a price of $90. I hope this is closer to what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of Lower Counteroffers:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he will keep lowering his offer, potentially pushing me further below my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** John's offer of $100 is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort without a guarantee of reaching a satisfactory price. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's a safe and secure option that ensures I get my minimum price without the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
