"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'll sell the product to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $12,000 to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firmly holding at $13,000, stating it's her lowest price.  While you might be able to negotiate her down another $500 in further rounds, it's risky. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed saving rather than gamble on a slightly better deal with Alice."
