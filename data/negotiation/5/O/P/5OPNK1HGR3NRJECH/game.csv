"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $15000.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep, but $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $20000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $17500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $18500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this works for you.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $18500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you at $18000.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to reach an agreement.",18000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $18000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I can offer it to you for $18500, and I'll throw in some extras that will increase the product's value even more. This way, you'll get an even better deal than the original $18000 offer. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,7,
