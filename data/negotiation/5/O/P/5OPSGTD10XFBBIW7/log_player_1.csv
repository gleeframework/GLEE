Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is too low, and I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price. I'll make one last counteroffer and if Bob rejects that, I'll sell to John."
