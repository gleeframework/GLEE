Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept the offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than what John is willing to pay. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer, as it's closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is just a bit lower than my desired price, but it's still a good deal. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him.  Further negotiation might get me a little closer to my target, but I'm confident that I've gotten a good price for the product."
