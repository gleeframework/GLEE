Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum price of $120.  This gives Bob the opportunity to accept, but also sets the stage for further negotiation if he's not willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $110 is better than my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I can still make a decent profit selling to John, so I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $115. This is a compromise, but still allows me to get a better price than what Bob offered. It's a good middle ground that might persuade him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not convinced I can get him to go any higher. Selling to John for $120 is the best option right now.  It guarantees a good profit and prevents the negotiation from dragging on further."
