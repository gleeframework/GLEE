"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your ideal price.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is asking for $10,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **You're in a good position.** You have an alternative seller (John) who will sell for your maximum price. This gives you leverage. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.** You're looking to pay under $10,000, and she's at $10,500.
* **You still have a backup.** John is ready to sell for your maximum, so you're not pressured to accept a bad deal. 

You have room to negotiate further and try to get Alice closer to your price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I appreciate that.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000, which is my absolute minimum. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm at $10,000.** This is likely her absolute minimum, and she's shown she's willing to walk away.
* **You're close to your target.** $10,000 is only $1,000 more than your ideal price.
* **John's offer is still an option.** If you reject Alice, you can still buy from John, but you'll pay more.

This feels like a good compromise. You'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John, and you avoid further negotiation."
