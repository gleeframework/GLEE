"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $10,000,  I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still can't exceed $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not going to settle for anything less than $12,000 at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price.  This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a very reasonable price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for coming down to $12,000. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is closer to my minimum than before, I'm still not satisfied.  I think there's a good chance I can get him to go a little higher.  I also have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. I'm confident you'll agree this is a fair price for a product of this quality.  I'm open to discussing it further, but I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe we can reach an agreement within my budget. I am willing to pay $11,800 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get Bob to come up to a price I'm happy with.  I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a price that's too low.  John is a guaranteed sale for $15,000, which meets my minimum price."
