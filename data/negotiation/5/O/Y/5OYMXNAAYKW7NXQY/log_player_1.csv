"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the ""unique value,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand.
* **Anchoring:** This high starting point acts as an anchor. Even if Bob intends to negotiate down, his counteroffers might be higher than if we started lower.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the door open for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he expresses interest, accepting $850,000 would be a substantial loss. It's too early to sell to John, as we have room to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.  We'll use our counteroffer in the next round to steer the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial decrease from our initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously. However, we're still keeping the price well above both his offer and your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's high value without explicitly revealing your bottom line, keeping the power dynamic in your favor. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move significantly from his initial offer. It keeps us in the negotiation while still leaving you the option to walk away and sell to John in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value of this product, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer significantly, $1,000,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We're making progress in the negotiation, and it's too early to settle.  Let's continue negotiating and see if we can bridge the gap further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,500,000.  I'm firm on this price, but I believe it's a fair deal considering the value it brings.  Let me know if this works for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Firmness:** We're revealing your bottom line to Bob, emphasizing that this is your absolute lowest price. This conveys seriousness and a desire to close the deal. 
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the price without getting into specifics that might weaken your negotiating position. 
* **Call to Action:** Ending with a clear ""Let me know if this works for you"" prompts Bob for a decision, pushing him towards either accepting or making a significant counter-offer.

At this point, it's strategic to hold firm at your minimum price. Bob has shown strong interest and has significantly increased his offer. This approach either secures a deal at your minimum or leads Bob to walk away, at which point you can still sell to John."
