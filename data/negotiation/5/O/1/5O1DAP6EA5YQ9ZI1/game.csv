"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,050,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident it's worth more to you in the long run. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
