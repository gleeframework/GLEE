"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than the product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save $300,000 by going with John.  There's no strategic advantage to accepting Alice's offer in this scenario."
