"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I can offer you a slight adjustment: I'll sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
