"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has a lot of value, and I'm confident it will be very beneficial for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but I'm still limited to my budget of $8,000.  I'm willing to close the deal right now at that price.  Let's not waste any more time.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some urgency from your side, and I want to be fair. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a very reasonable price for the value you'll receive.",15000.0,Alice,5,
