"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I agree it has value, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and the potential of having to buy from John for a higher price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice. Saving $150,000 is a good outcome."
