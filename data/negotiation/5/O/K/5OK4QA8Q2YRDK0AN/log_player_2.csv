It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a better price from Alice.  You have plenty of rounds left, and $1,000,000 is a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%. This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and forces her to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still too high. I want to see if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. This also puts the pressure back on her to make a decision."
