Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $12500 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to pay $11500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $11,500 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?

Round 8

With only two rounds left, Bob isn't budging on his price. I'm at risk of going below my minimum, so I'll sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
