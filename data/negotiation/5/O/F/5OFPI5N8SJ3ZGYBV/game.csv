"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already done my research and know that this product is worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm. Would you consider $11,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another small adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm counteroffering at $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be honest, $12,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're unable to meet that, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
