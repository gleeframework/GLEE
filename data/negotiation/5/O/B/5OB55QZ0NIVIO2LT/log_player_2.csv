"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get closer to my budget. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's try $10,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows you to get the product at a price that's within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $10,000 is still significantly higher than my target price and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about $6,500? That's a significant move on my end, and puts us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $6,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above John's offer. I'll take one more chance to negotiate before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high.  How about $7,500?  That's my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice finally met my price limit, and it matches what John is offering.  There's no point in further negotiation or going with John, as the price is now the same."
