"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000 for the product?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's try $10,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows you to get the product at a price that's within your budget.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we're both trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about $6,500? That's a significant move on my end, and puts us closer to a deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $6,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high.  How about $7,500?  That's my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I might have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and gets us closer to a deal.",8000.0,Alice,7,
