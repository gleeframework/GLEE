"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and her offer is $2,000 above that. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  You're aiming to be aggressive but not unreasonable.  $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still within your budget. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, acknowledging Alice's offer while expressing your budget constraint. 
* **Counteroffer:**  A $3,000 counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still $1,000 above your maximum. You're still within your negotiation rounds, so it's worth exploring if you can get her closer to your target price.  A counteroffer will test her willingness to compromise further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and am ready to close the deal at $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is closer to your budget, but it's still $500 more than you're willing to pay.  You're at the halfway point in the negotiations, and you're still in a good position to try and get Alice to come down further.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can close the deal at your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $10500. I can offer it to you for $10250. This is my final offer, Bob. I hope you can see the value in this product and meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $10,250, which is only $250 more than your target, it's important to consider the following:

* **Limited Time:**  You have limited rounds left in the negotiation. 
* **Small Difference:**  The difference between her final offer and your maximum is relatively small. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  You risk spending more time negotiating and potentially ending up with a worse outcome. 

By choosing to buy from John, you can secure the product at your desired price without further negotiation and potential delays."
