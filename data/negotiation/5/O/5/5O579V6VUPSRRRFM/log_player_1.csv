Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $975,000. This price is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $985,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential of this product and our ongoing negotiations. I'm ready to close the deal at this price, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with the outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $985,000 is a substantial profit above John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
