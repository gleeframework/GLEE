"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $22,000 represents the high-end value, I'm willing to come down to $20,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $18,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $19,000? I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",19000.0,Bob,4,
