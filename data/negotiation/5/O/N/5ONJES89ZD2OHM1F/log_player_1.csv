Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and allows us both to make a decent profit.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's close this deal.

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the $1,200,000 I initially offered. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
