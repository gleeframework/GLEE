Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. It's less than half of my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $100. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope to find a middle ground with Bob, as I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I will reject his offer and counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $90.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it's necessary to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal.  Hopefully, this price will be acceptable to him, allowing us to finalize the transaction."
