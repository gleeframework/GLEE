Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Anchoring:** By opening with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation. Even if the price goes down, it's likely to remain higher than if you'd started with a lower offer.
* **John as Leverage:**  You have a strong alternative with John ($1,000,000), giving you leverage in the negotiation. Bob doesn't know about John, so you don't want to reveal that information unless necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe I can't meet your asking price. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** While closer to your $1,000,000 minimum, accepting would still leave money on the table.
* **John as a Backstop:**  Having John guarantees you at least $1,000,000, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While we're getting closer, $950,000 is still a significant gap from my initial assessment of the product's value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000."", ""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a substantial concession from $1,300,000 to $1,175,000, signaling willingness to negotiate but also emphasizing the product's value.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  This counteroffer tests how serious Bob is about acquiring the product. If he's genuinely interested and $950,000 was just an opening gambit, he's likely to counter again.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still well above both Bob's valuation and your guaranteed offer from John, preserving your negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe the product is worth less than what you're asking. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Your Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, securing a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you could likely push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time, and closing the deal now provides immediate value."
