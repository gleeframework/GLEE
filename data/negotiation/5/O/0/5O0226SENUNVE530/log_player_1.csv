"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **Ambition:** I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000, so aiming for a higher price is justified.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance Bob will immediately reject this offer, it also positions me for a potentially more profitable deal. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy is based on limited information about Bob. If I knew more about his potential value for the product or his negotiation style, I could adjust my opening offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Value Perception:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm still optimistic about getting a better price, and the fact that Bob countered at all suggests he's interested.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially earn more from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,400,000, showing willingness to compromise. This also keeps the offer above Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintain Value:** $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum value, so it's a worthwhile negotiation.
* **Signal Interest:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm interested in closing the deal, but I'm not desperate to accept his offer.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind the time constraint.  I'm not going to get caught up in a long negotiation and might need to move closer to John's offer if necessary in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Time:**  While I'm still hopeful to get a better price, I'm starting to run out of time. 
* **John as Backstop:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming increasingly attractive as a guaranteed alternative.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I need to bridge the gap quickly but not give away too much.
* I'm actively considering John's offer as a fallback if Bob continues to refuse."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is halfway between Bob's last offer ($1,100,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin. 
* **Urgency:** I'm signaling that I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer if a deal with Bob isn't reached soon. 
* **Last Chance:** This is likely my last chance to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer.  

**Important Note:** I'm closely watching the time remaining. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to make a tough decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is too high. There's no guarantee I can secure a significantly better offer, especially with John's offer as a safety net.
* **Profitable Outcome:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer still results in a profitable sale. 

**Important Note:**  This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing a deal altogether.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid potentially ending up with nothing."
