"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $120.  Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 was a bit high, I admit. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go over $120. Is there any chance we can work something out at that price?",120.0,Bob,4,
