"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is still too low for me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. How about $10,500?  I think this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still higher than what I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a few rounds, but I'm not making much progress. I'm still not comfortable with his offer, and I'm not sure he's willing to go any higher.  To ensure I get a good price for the product, I'm going to sell it to John."
