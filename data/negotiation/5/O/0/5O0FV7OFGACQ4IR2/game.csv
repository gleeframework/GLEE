"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. How about $10,500?  I think this is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still higher than what I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
