It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}

This counteroffer increases your previous offer slightly, showing flexibility.  You're still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's last offer.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above your desired price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

This counteroffer is a small increase from your last offer, showing that you are willing to compromise. It is still a good amount lower than Alice's offer, and it should hopefully make her consider accepting your offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range.  You are close to your target price, and it is risky to continue negotiating.  There's a chance Alice might refuse any further counteroffers, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the purchase."
