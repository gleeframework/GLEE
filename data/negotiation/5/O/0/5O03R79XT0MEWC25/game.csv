"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're eager to close the deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm now offering the product for $1,080,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm ready to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
