"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your original offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
