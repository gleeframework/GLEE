"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in the next round, but I want to see if I can get a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a good starting point, I believe I can get a higher price. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  I have 8 rounds remaining, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also confident in the value of the product.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,300,000, as that would be too close to John's offer and not worth the risk of continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to what I want, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement closer to my ideal value. With 6 rounds remaining, I have some room to maneuver and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,380,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable range. I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal while also trying to push for a slightly higher price. I believe this amount is still attractive to Bob, and it will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,360,000.  We've been going back and forth for a while now, and while I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,400,000, I think this is a fair price considering the remaining rounds and the risk of going back and forth further. 

This deal is significantly better than selling to John for $1,200,000, and it feels like a good compromise after our negotiation."
