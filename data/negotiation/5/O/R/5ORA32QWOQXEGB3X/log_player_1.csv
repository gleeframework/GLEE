Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $150, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100) and John's offer ($100).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the product's value to Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
