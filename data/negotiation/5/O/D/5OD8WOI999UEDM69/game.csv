"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, your proposed price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000. This is my best offer, as it reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I need to see a significant move closer to my previous offer for this to make sense.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000, but that's my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I need us to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering we're both trying to strike a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
