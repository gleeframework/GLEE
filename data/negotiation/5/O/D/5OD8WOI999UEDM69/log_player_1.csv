Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, your proposed price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000. This is my best offer, as it reflects a more reasonable compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I need to see a significant move closer to my previous offer for this to make sense.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000, but that's my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I need us to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering we're both trying to strike a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is moving too slowly.  While he might eventually be willing to go higher, it's unlikely he'll reach our $950,000 in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed $800,000."
