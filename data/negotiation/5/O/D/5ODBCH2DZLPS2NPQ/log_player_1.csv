Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but needs to make the offer attractive enough for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, offering it for slightly less than John's offer ($1,500,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit above her minimum."
