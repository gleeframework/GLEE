"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the price down a bit. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. Considering our initial offer of $950,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a better price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $915,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,5,
