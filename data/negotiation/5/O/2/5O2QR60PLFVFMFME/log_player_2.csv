Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $8,500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
