Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $15,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's still above my minimum and better than selling to John. There's a risk Bob might come down further, but it's not worth risking a lower price or delaying the sale."
