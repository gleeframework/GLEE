"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $175 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $155. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $140, which is still a good deal for you considering you're getting closer to your desired price.  What do you say?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to give up on the price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $145. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",145.0,Alice,5,
