Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm countering with $170. This is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm happy with. John is a guaranteed sale at $150, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
