{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum.** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** Bob knows exactly what you're offering and what you expect.
* **It invites Bob to engage.** The question at the end encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price.  There's a good chance Bob will be willing to go a little higher, especially since he's already shown interest and is willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115, which is closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $100. I think that's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my desired price."
