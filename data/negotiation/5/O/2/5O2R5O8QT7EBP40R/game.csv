"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115, which is closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go above $100. I think that's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100?,100.0,Bob,6,
