"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $750000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value I see in the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $815000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",815000.0,Alice,5,
