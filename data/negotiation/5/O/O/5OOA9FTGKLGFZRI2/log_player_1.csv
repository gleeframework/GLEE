Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
