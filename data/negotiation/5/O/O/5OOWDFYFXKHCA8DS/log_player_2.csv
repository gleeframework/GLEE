"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first.  While $110 is close to my budget, there's still room for negotiation before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show continued interest.** 
* **Establish a starting point for negotiation** that is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Avoid going too low too quickly**, which could offend Alice and make her less willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met me halfway, and $105 is a reasonable price, especially considering it's still under my $100 limit. It's not worth the risk of her retracting the offer or further negotiation."
