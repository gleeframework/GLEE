"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree your product is valuable,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,400,000? ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
