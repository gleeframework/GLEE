Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated this is his ""best and final offer"".  While it's a good price, we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss of $200,000 compared to John's guaranteed purchase. It's in our best interest to secure the guaranteed profit."
