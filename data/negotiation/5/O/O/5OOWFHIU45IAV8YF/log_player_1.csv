I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my valuation."

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider the product's worth. I'll make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John."
