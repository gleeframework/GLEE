,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to negotiating.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I can go.  I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair price given the value to me and is within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to negotiating.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your budget, but $925,000 still doesn't quite cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen.",940000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $930,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $935,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",935000.0,Alice,9,
