"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had budgeted. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
