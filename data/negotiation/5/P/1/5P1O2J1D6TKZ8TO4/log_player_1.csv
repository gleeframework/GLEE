"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After reviewing its value, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects its true potential."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), you establish a strong anchor. This gives you room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Confident Justification:** The message avoids sounding desperate and instead emphasizes the product's value.  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price makes it clear that you're open to negotiation, inviting Bob to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's room to explore if he's willing to go higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is still considerably lower than what I believe the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Counteroffer:**  You acknowledge Bob's offer to show you're taking his input seriously.
* **Reaffirming Value:** You reiterate your belief in the product's higher value without being overly aggressive.
* **Significant Drop, But Still Above Target:** You make a substantial drop from your initial price ($2,000,000 to $1,800,000) to signal flexibility while remaining well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Encouraging Compromise:** The phrasing ""Let's find a middle ground"" promotes a collaborative tone and aims to move the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,700,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum price ($1,500,000) and John's standing offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to ""meet halfway"" indicates he's serious about closing the deal and likely won't budge much higher.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and potentially lead to a stalemate. Accepting now secures the profit and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. 

While there's a chance Bob might have gone slightly higher, the current offer presents a favorable balance of profit and minimized risk."
