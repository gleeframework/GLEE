Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a reasonable price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still allowing me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a profitable price for me, but it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob, especially if he continues to make lower counteroffers."
