"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I know it's a significant investment, but I believe the value it can bring to your business is exceptional.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your continued interest.  While I can't go as low as $950,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's the best I can do at this time. I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
