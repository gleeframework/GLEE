"Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount you've provided. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to come down to $1,375,000. This offer still reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution, and I admire that.  $1,360,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1,365,000.  This is a very fair price considering the potential this product holds for your business. I hope you'll find this acceptable.",1365000.0,Alice,5,
