"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening at $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $200,000 less than its worth to him. 
* **Leaving Room:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, but still allows for a profit substantially higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Building Trust:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the deal as beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to the product's actual value. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price, but leaves room for further negotiation in the next round.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a loss compared to the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer moves me closer to Bob's offer but keeps a considerable profit margin.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  The message frames the offer as a compromise and a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $925,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for further negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the value of the product, I think $900000 would be a fair price. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is now very close to my previous counteroffer of $925,000.
* **Profitable Deal:**  Accepting this offer will secure a substantial profit of $100,000 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or ultimately rejecting any deal, potentially forcing me to sell to John for a lower price. 

At this point, it's more prudent to secure a profitable deal rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
