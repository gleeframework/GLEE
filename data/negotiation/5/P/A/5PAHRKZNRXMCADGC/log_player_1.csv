Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Bob is only offering $700,000.  I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great value for you considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $795,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale. I'll take John's offer of $800,000 to ensure a deal."
