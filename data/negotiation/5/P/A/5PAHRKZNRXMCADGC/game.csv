"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's start the conversation! ",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great value for you considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable product at a fair price, and allowing me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",795000.0,Bob,6,
