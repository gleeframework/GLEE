"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $100 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately.  Rejecting allows you to explore if Alice might be willing to sell for less.  There's always the option to buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a significant discount (20%) is a good strategy to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she's truly motivated to sell, she might accept this offer, but if not, it sets the stage for further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign.  However, it's still within your budget, and you can likely get a better price. By rejecting, you continue the negotiation, potentially getting closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is closer to your desired price, but you can still try to squeeze out a bit more. Increasing your counteroffer slightly to $85 shows that you're willing to negotiate while still remaining within your budget. This keeps the pressure on Alice to make a concession."
