Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $925,000 reflects that value while still being a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting closer to that figure is beneficial.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy balances ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward for a successful high offer makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
