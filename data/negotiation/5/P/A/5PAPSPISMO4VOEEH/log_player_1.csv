Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming high initially makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Strong but Polite Language:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's input.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging his perspective as a buyer."
