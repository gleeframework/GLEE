"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While I value your perspective, $1200000 is significantly below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1750000. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
