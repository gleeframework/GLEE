"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to go up to $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $95? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
