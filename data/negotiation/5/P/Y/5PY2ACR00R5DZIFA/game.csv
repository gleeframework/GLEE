"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 10500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 10800?",10800.0,Alice,5,
