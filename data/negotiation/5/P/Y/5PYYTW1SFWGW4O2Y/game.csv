"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $950,000 is a significant sum, I'm holding firm at $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product and the substantial benefits it will bring to your operations. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1,000,000? This reflects the product's value to me and allows us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
