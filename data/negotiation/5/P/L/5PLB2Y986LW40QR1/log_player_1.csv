I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can do better with a counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,075,000, so I'll reject this offer and counter with a new offer. The time pressure is starting to build, but I don't want to give up on a better deal just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

While $1,087,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can get to a mutually acceptable price. Time is running out, but I'm not ready to settle for that amount just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,087,500 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,100,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product, and I'm willing to add a small premium to meet you halfway on the difference. Can you consider $1,087,250?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time.  Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm getting closer to my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000.  While it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement with Bob."
