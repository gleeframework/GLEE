"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still above his target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $800,000 target.  Offering $850,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, while still showing a willingness to negotiate. This gives Bob a chance to see if Alice is willing to come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is further away from Bob's target price than his initial counteroffer of $850,000.  It's clear Alice is not willing to budge much, and continuing to negotiate could lead to even higher offers from her.  Therefore, the best option for Bob is to secure the product from John for his desired price of $800,000."
