,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm flexible, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
