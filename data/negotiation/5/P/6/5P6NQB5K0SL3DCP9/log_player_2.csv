"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""That's a great starting point, Alice! I appreciate the offer.  However, my budget for this product is a bit tighter. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Would you be open to that? "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is closer to his ideal price point.  $13,000 is still a good deal for Alice, and it offers some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $13,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's a compromise that allows both parties to find common ground.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate further. Accepting the offer guarantees a lower price than buying from John."
