Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob than to you, leaving him a reasonable profit margin.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your potential gain:** A $1,200,000 sale is a very good outcome for you.
* **Encourage negotiation:** Leaving room for Bob to counteroffer keeps the conversation open and potentially allows you to reach an even higher price. 
* **Avoid selling to John:** This offer makes it unlikely that you'll have to settle for the lower price John is offering.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what you'd ideally like to get. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. By rejecting his offer, you maintain the possibility of reaching a higher price, and demonstrate that you're not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to meet him halfway, while still maintaining a substantial profit for yourself.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to negotiate can increase the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Signal your value:** This offer maintains a high price point, indicating that you believe the product is worth more than Bob's last offer.
* **Maximize potential gain:** This price is still much higher than your minimum acceptable price and leaves room for a final agreement that is beneficial to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to what you initially wanted, you can still potentially get a higher price. You've already established a higher price point, and rejecting this offer shows you're not willing to settle for less than the product is worth.  The goal is to reach a price that maximizes your profits while ensuring a deal is reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a further compromise, acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to go higher than $1,100,000. It's a good compromise that allows you to secure a price very close to your ideal selling point.  

By sending this counteroffer, you're hoping to:

* **Reach a final agreement:** This offer shows a strong willingness to close the deal.
* **Maintain a high price:** You are still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  If Bob accepts, this will finalize the deal and avoid further back and forth. 

Let's see if this is the final offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, the negotiations have gone back and forth with no clear sign of a breakthrough. Bob seems determined to stay below $1,100,000, and you've already conceded multiple times. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John. While it's less than your ideal price, it's still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, and it avoids further negotiation and potential stalemate with Bob."
