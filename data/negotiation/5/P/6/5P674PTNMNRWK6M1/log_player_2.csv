Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
