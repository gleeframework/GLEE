"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $850,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",800000.0,Alice,3,
