Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $900,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum desired value ($1,000,000). 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob to consider it. I'm also highlighting the product's value to encourage his interest. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy balances the risk of losing the sale to Bob with the potential for a higher profit. There's a good chance Bob will accept the offer, as he still sees value in the product at that price. If he rejects it, I can confidently move on to John and secure my minimum desired value."
