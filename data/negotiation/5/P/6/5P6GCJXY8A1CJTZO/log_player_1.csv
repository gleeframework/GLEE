"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this valuable product. Considering its unique potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,200,000. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your minimum and John's guaranteed offer. You have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** You're making a significant concession to show flexibility but staying firmly above both Bob's offer and your safety net with John.  This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John. While you could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit."
