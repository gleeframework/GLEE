"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the industry. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Can you consider that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low. I've done some research, and I believe the product's value is closer to $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and potential returns on investment. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $775000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $810000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential returns on investment. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $810000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product. Can you consider that?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering it to you for $820000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $820000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $790000. Can you consider that?",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. I'm offering the product to you for $825000, and this is my final price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",800000.0,Bob,10,
