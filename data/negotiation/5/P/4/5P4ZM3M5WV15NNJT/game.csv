"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, recognizing the value the product holds for you. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and our ongoing discussion. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
