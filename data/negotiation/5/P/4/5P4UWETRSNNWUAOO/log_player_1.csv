Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's close to your minimum:**  You're asking for $140, which is only $40 less than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's higher than your minimum:**  This gives you some wiggle room to potentially earn more than your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It includes a message explaining the offer and the price directly. 

This strategy leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while also allowing you to end the negotiation and sell to John if you feel the negotiation isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the value you're aiming for. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer shows Bob you're willing to stand your ground.  This will hopefully encourage him to come up with a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price of $140. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's not your initial offer, but it's also not Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Is still higher than your minimum:**  $130 is well above your minimum of $100, allowing you to potentially earn more.
* **Provides a clear justification:**  Explaining that $130 is a middle ground between your initial price and Bob's offer gives him a logical reason to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $125? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your desired price:** $125 is only $5 away from your ideal price of $130.  
* **Better than selling to John:**  You'll be earning $25 more than you would by selling to John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if you reject Bob's offer, he might walk away entirely, or you might end up with an even lower price in subsequent rounds.

While it's tempting to keep pushing for a higher price,  $125 represents a solid deal for you and a reasonable price for Bob."
