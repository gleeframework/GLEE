"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference?  $11,000 for the product, and we can close this deal.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 just isn't going to work for me.  How about $10,800?  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,5,
