"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $11,500, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference?  $11,000 for the product, and we can close this deal.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is better than $11,500, Bob can likely still do better by continuing to negotiate. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can potentially get closer to his target price of $10,500.  Buying from John at this point would be a waste of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 just isn't going to work for me.  How about $10,800?  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,500.  While a bit more than ideal, accepting this offer ensures a deal within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of going over budget by buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise, and Bob should accept to secure the purchase."
