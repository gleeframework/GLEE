Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference?  $11,000 for the product, and we can close this deal.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 just isn't going to work for me.  How about $10,800?  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10800}
