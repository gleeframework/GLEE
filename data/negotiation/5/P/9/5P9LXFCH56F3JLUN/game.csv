"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $750,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's close this out and move forward.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",775000.0,Bob,6,
