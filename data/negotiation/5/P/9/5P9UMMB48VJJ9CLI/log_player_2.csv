Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, and starting with a counteroffer of $950,000 is a bold move. This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point that shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's a slight improvement from the previous round.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate aggressively. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice and gives Bob more room to maneuver.  It also leaves open the possibility that Alice might come down further in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's minimum price point.  This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob, as it saves him $200,000 compared to buying from John. It's also a reasonable compromise that shows Bob is willing to meet halfway.  There's a good chance that Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her desired price than the previous rounds."
