{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant profit for you:** You're aiming for $4,000 profit, which is a decent return.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** He still gets the product for $3,000 less than its value to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if needed, but you're starting strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you can still aim for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for this product. That's a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and it still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise.  It's a bit lower than what you originally hoped for, but it's still a $1,500 profit for you, which is a decent return.  Accepting his offer means you can finalize the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
