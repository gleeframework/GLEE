"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached, as Bob can potentially save money compared to buying from John."
