"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting with a price above what the product is worth to Bob, but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down and leaves Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal.
* **Enthusiasm:** My message conveys confidence and excitement about the product. This might influence Bob to feel more positive about the deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm stating my price upfront but also inviting Bob to negotiate, making the process feel more collaborative. 

I'm excited to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. That's my top offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd like to close the deal quickly, accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with him in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still leaves some room for me to make a profit.  This is my best offer. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the low offer:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price, making it clear that I won't settle for anything less.
* **Reasonable compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's a significant drop from my initial price but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth a lot to him, which might encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and collaborative, aiming to build rapport and encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to squeeze out a little more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $14,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both close to agreeing."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm but showing flexibility:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise further. My counteroffer is a small increase from his last one, but still below my initial target.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth a lot to him and that this price is still a good deal.
* **Closing language:** I'm using language that implies urgency and a desire to close the deal, hoping to nudge Bob into accepting my offer.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However,  I'm still only willing to pay $14,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll need to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he won't go above $14,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, I'm better off selling to John for $15,000 to ensure I meet my profit goal."
