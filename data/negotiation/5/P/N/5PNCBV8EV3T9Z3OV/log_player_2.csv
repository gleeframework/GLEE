"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly above his budget, and he has other options. He can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. That's my top offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still leaves some room for me to make a profit.  This is my best offer. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal from Alice, or buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $14,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both close to agreeing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,500 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already indicated his willingness to pay $14,000, and John is offering the product for $12,000, so he has leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However,  I'm still only willing to pay $14,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll need to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
