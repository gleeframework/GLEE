"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. That's my top offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still leaves some room for me to make a profit.  This is my best offer. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $14,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both close to agreeing.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However,  I'm still only willing to pay $14,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll need to look at other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
