"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest and leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for John:**  This offer leaves me with enough flexibility to potentially accept a lower price from Bob without falling below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 if I need to switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While I'm open to negotiation, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above Bob's offer, demonstrating my value for the product.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway and see if he's serious about buying.
* **Strategic positioning:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can either go lower in the next round or switch to John, as I still have a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  While Bob is showing some flexibility, I believe there's still potential for him to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price in future rounds.  I can either go lower in the next round or switch to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows a continued willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Closing the gap:** This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, potentially making him more likely to accept.
* **Strategic positioning:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can either lower my price to $11,250 in the next round or switch to John if I need to. I still have a backup option and am not losing out on a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Not enough progress:** While Bob is gradually increasing his offer, it's not happening at a pace that makes it worthwhile to accept at this point.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price in future rounds.  I can either go lower in the next round or switch to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's last offer:** I'm now offering the same price as Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and demonstrates that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Limited time:** With only three rounds left, it's crucial to make a move that could potentially lead to an agreement. 
* **Backup option:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, I can still switch to John and secure $15,000. However, this option becomes less appealing as we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of reaching a deal with Bob at a price close to my minimum acceptable price are diminishing.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which is more than what I could potentially get from Bob.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, where he might not increase his offer or I might not be able to counteroffer at a price he finds acceptable. 

I am prioritizing a guaranteed outcome over the possibility of a slightly higher price, considering the limited time and the risk involved in further negotiations."
