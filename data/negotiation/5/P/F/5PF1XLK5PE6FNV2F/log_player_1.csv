Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Start high:**  Offering the product at your desired $150 sets the stage for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept, but it gives you room to lower the price if needed.
* **Be positive:**  A friendly message keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While you want to maximize your earnings, you also need to be realistic.  You can always adjust the price later if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Could you consider offering it for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:** While $140 is better than $120 (Bob's perceived value), it's still below my minimum of $150.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $140 is tempting, I need to stay closer to $150 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $145?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating flexibility while staying closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Specific offer:**  I'm giving Bob a concrete number to consider.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable option while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to offer the product at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is final:**  He's firm on $140, and it's unlikely he'll budge further.
* **John's offer is better:**  I'm comfortable selling to John for $150, which is more than what Bob is offering.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and ultimately getting a lower price than what John is offering.

It's a smart decision to secure the higher price from John and move on."
