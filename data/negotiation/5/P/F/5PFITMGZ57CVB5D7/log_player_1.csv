Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum ($100) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not setting a ""take it or leave it"" price, implying that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Important Note:** I'm mindful of John's $100 offer as a backup, but I'm aiming for a higher price if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'm willing to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Even though Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not immediately jumping to sell to John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135. That would be a good price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm keeping the tone positive and reminding Bob that finding a price that works for both of us is the goal.
* **Leaving Room for a Slight Adjustment:** I'm still a little above my minimum of $100, leaving a small amount of wiggle room if Bob needs to come down further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of Losing a Sale:** If I reject this offer and continue to negotiate, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's lower offer.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate might drag out the process, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly higher price.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that's just slightly below my ideal but still a good outcome."
