Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**
    * I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum.
    * I am aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000, so I am not risking losing money. 
    *  By offering $12,000, I'm  hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little extra.

**Note:** I will adjust my price depending on Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I will likely offer him a lower price, but still above $10,000."
