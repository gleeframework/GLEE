"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe $900,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm still willing to make a significant profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
