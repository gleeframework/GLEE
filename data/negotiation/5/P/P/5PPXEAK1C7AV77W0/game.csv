"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'd be willing to buy it for that price, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can offer you a compromise at $155. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",155.0,Alice,5,
