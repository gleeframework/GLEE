"Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.

"Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, your initial offer is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  I'm confident that this price reflects the product's worth while also being fair to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential return on investment. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,150,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the potential of this product.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
