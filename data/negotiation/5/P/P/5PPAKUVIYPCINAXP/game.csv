"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $750,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
