Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This should give you some room to negotiate.  

Here's why this strategy is good:

* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not so high that Bob will immediately reject it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price up or down based on Bob's reaction.
* **It keeps John as a backup:** If Bob doesn't accept, you can still sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $150. It's worth continuing to negotiate, hoping to get a better offer from Bob or sell to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I'm still interested in your product. I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $115 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, it's best to take that option.  Further negotiation with Bob risks losing John as a buyer and ultimately ending up with a lower price."
