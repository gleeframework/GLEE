Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will yield significant returns for you. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer ($2,000,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, ensuring we don't lose out.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of securing the deal with Bob."
