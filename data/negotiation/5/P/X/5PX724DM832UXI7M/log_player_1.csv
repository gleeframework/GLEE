Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential."" This framing helps justify the higher asking price.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $1,200,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob may try to negotiate the price down. Be prepared to counter-offer strategically.
* **Relationship Building:**  While aiming for the best price, consider the long-term implications of the negotiation on your relationship with Bob. A slightly more flexible approach might be beneficial if a strong future relationship is important."
