"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $142.50? That's still a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $125? That's a fair bit closer to your price.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $125 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $135.  I think this is a fair price that benefits us both.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  How about $130 and we call it a deal?",130.0,Bob,6,
