{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset.  My asking price is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. I have 9 rounds left and want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000, which still gives you a significant benefit. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I have 6 rounds left and want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. To make this work, I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique benefits and its potential for your business. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
