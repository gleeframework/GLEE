"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000, which still gives you a significant benefit. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. To make this work, I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique benefits and its potential for your business. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
