Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.

Let's see if we can close this deal.
