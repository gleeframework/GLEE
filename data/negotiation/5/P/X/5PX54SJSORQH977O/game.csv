"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing the details further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a strong valuation, the product's unique aspects and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm still very interested in the product. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Would you consider meeting at $1,350,000?  This would allow me to feel comfortable letting go of the product at this stage.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
