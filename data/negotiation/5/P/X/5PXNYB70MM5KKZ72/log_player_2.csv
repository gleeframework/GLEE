Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is as close as I can get to your target price, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
