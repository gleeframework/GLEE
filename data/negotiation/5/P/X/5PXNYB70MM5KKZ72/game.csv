"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle on $11,000? That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is as close as I can get to your target price, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
