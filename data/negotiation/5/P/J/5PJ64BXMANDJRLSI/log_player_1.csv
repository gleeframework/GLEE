Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $9,000, considering its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,000 creates a win-win situation:
    *  Bob saves $1,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * You earn $1,000 more than selling to your backup buyer, John.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, highlights the product's value to Bob, and invites a response. 

This approach aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while still ensuring a profitable sale."
