"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in making a deal, but I'm only comfortable paying $85.  This would allow us both to benefit and finalize a transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",85.0,Bob,2,
