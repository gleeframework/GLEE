You can potentially get a better price from Alice, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what you're willing to pay. It leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating your serious interest in purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's latest offer is only $50,000 less than what John is selling the product for. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, as there's a chance she might reject your next counteroffer and you'll end up paying more. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price point."
