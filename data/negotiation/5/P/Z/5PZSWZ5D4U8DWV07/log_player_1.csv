"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($12,000), but I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $10,000. By offering $11,500, I leave room for negotiation while still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $10,500 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. Can you consider $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close to my minimum value of $12,000. It's a good compromise and ensures I get a reasonable price while still closing the deal. I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation rounds."
