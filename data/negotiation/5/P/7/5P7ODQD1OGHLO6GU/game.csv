"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $112, which is a good compromise for both of us.  This is still a very fair price for the value you're getting.  What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $109 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $111?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets me move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",111.0,Alice,7,
