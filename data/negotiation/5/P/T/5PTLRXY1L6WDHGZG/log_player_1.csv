Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $2,000,000 is still out of reach for me. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $800,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute limit. While this is more than half his initial offer, it's still significantly less than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even further from our desired profit. 

Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significant jump in Bob's offer. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
