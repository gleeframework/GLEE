"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is much higher than your maximum budget and even her own valuation. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting significantly lower than my budget, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives me plenty of room to increase my offer gradually if Alice completely rejects it.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give me a better understanding of Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the value and potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down a bit, $2,000,000 is still significantly over my budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to adjust the price suggests there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** It's good to keep the option of buying from John open if the negotiations don't move in a favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $2,000,000 is still out of reach for me. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $800,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Going to My Maximum:** I'm offering my absolute maximum budget now. This shows Alice I'm serious but also sets a firm limit.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and making it clear I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm comfortable with this offer because I know I have the option to buy from John at this price if Alice rejects it."
