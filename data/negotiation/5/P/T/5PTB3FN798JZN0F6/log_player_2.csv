Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's still a bit above your target, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

While Alice is getting closer to my price range, it's clear she's unlikely to go below $80.  I can get the product for my target price from John, so there's no need to negotiate further."
