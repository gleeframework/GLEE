Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $15,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price with John.  It makes sense to start with a higher offer to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher elsewhere (""before I list it publicly""). 
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker and avoid missing out.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright, leading Alice back to her $12,000 guarantee with John. 
* **Bob's Perspective:**  Alice doesn't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay above the $12,000 value. This offer assumes there's some wiggle room in Bob's valuation.

**This is just one strategy.**  Alice could adjust her offer based on her risk tolerance and any additional information she might have about Bob's negotiation style."
