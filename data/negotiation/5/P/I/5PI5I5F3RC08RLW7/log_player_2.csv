"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer is already $100,000 higher than your maximum. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice values the product at $800,000, meaning there's a significant gap between her minimum and your maximum. 
* **Rejection allows for a counteroffer.** By rejecting, you can start a negotiation process and try to get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your maximum, aiming to close the gap and find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While the product is extremely valuable, I'm willing to adjust my price to  $1,050,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget.**  She's dropped the price to $1,050,000, which is within your maximum price point of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the effort.**  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the time and energy involved. 
* **Accepting secures the product.**  There's a risk that if you keep rejecting, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, or you might have to pay the full $1,200,000 to John. 

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is the best option in this situation. It allows you to acquire the product while staying within your budget and minimizing the risk of missing out on the deal."
