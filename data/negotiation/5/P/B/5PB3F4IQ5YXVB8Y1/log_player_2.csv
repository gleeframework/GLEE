"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with buying from John if necessary."
