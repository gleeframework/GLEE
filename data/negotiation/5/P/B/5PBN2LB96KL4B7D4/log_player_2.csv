**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to you, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and you should aim to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make this deal work.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than you're comfortable paying.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1087500? I'm confident this price works for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is only $87,500 higher than what you're willing to pay from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing the price even higher, potentially exceeding John's offer.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product while still staying within your budget."
