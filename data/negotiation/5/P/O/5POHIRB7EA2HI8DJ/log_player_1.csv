Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($12,000) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This also leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit to see if we can reach an agreement.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's offer was too low."
