"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe the proposed price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that aligns with my budget and the perceived value.  Would you consider $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you'll get from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This price is closer to my original asking price, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $800,000 makes more financial sense, even if it means a slightly smaller potential gain from the product's true value."
