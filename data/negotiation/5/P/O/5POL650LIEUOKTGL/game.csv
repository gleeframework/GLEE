"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe the proposed price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that aligns with my budget and the perceived value.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you'll get from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my current budget.  Would you be open to considering $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This price is closer to my original asking price, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
