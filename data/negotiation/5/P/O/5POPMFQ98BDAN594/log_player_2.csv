"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good idea to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $20,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sensible choice to go with John."
