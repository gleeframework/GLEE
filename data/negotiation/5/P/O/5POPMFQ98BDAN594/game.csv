"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $20,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
