"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $10,200, which is a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
