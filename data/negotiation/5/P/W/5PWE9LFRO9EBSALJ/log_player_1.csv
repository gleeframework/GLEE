Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" compared to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, I might adjust my approach in subsequent interactions."
