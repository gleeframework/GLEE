,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad you're interested. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $940,000? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I can only go up to $920,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $920,000 is still a bit too low. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $930,000. This is my final offer - let's seal the deal.",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",910000.0,Bob,8,
