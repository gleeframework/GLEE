"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,100,000.  I think that's fair given its value. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering the market and potential alternatives.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
