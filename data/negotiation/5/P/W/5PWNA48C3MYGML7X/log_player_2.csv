**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. It makes more sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and settle on $975000? This way, we can both walk away happy with a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit too high.  You can try to negotiate a bit more, aiming for a price closer to your desired $800,000. If she doesn't budge, you can always go with John's offer."
