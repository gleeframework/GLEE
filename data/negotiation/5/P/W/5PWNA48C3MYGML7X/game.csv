"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and settle on $975000? This way, we can both walk away happy with a fair deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
