{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, or at least secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his $850,000 offer but lower than my initial $1,200,000 offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his $850,000 offer and my previous $1,200,000 offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to both of us, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not offering my minimum price yet, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's Counteroffer:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price that's closer to my goal.
* **Rejecting Bob's Counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide if I'm willing to continue negotiating or if it's better to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite there:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still $50,000 short. 
* **John's offer is still the safer bet:**  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, selling to John guarantees me my minimum.  The potential of losing more time in negotiation for a relatively small gain isn't worth the risk. 
* **Time Factor:** The longer the negotiation goes, the more likely I am to lose John as a buyer or find another opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's, but still higher than his offer, to see if we can bridge the gap.  
* **Selling to John:** If this counteroffer doesn't work, I'm ready to go with John. I've established a baseline with Bob, and I'm not going to waste time negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This way, we can both walk away happy with a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to bridge the gap between our positions. It's only $25,000 away from Bob's offer and $25,000 above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing it as a ""split the difference"" solution, making it seem like a fair and mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Time Pressure:** By suggesting a final compromise, I'm implicitly signaling that I'm nearing my decision point.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** If Bob accepts, I've achieved a satisfactory price that's close to my minimum.
* **Selling to John:** If Bob rejects, I'm ready to sell to John. I've made a final attempt to negotiate with Bob, and it's time to move on to a guaranteed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and my budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Significant Progress:** Bob is sticking to his $950,000 offer, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no indication that he's willing to budge further.
* **John Offers Certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,000,000. This is a risk-free option, whereas continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further delays and potentially a lower price.
* **Time is Money:**  The longer I spend negotiating with Bob, the more opportunity cost I incur. It's not worth risking the possibility of a better deal with another buyer or a missed opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
