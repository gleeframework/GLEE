"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, aiming to leave room for bargaining while staying above Alice's potential selling point of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm afraid $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down slightly, the price is still above your ideal target.  There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. It seems we're getting closer. How about we settle at $11,800?"",
""product_price"": 11800
}
```

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still leaving some room for negotiation and staying under your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the direction we're heading, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $13,250? I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is barely budging from her previous offer. It's time to push a little harder or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  My final offer is $12,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counteroffer:
* **Presents a firm stance:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you signal seriousness and a limit to further concessions. 
* **Offers a price appealing to Alice:**  The $12,000 matches Alice's value for the product, making it likely she'll accept.
* **Introduces an alternative:** Mentioning ""another option"" (John) subtly reminds Alice that you have other choices. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal before resorting to John's higher price."
