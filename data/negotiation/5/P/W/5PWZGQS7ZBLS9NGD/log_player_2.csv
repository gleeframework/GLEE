"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows you to realize significant value while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's a potential for a significant price reduction.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process and try to achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still providing you with a solid return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows you to get a great deal, and it's a fair price point for me. Let's find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $900,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.**  
* **Buying from John for $1,000,000 is no longer the better option.** 
* **While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away or further reducing her offer exists.** 
* **Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is within his budget and saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John.**"
