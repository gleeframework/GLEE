Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that's still above my minimum value and leaves some room for further negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering below my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to risk getting stuck with an offer that doesn't meet my needs.  John is a sure thing at my minimum value, so I'll take his offer and avoid further negotiation."
