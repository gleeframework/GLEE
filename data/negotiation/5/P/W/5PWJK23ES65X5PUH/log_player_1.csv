Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal and would be very beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that the product might be valued even higher. 
* **Potential Profit:**  A price of $150 allows for a potential $30 profit above your minimum. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, there's room to negotiate down towards $120, ensuring you still make a profit compared to selling to John."
