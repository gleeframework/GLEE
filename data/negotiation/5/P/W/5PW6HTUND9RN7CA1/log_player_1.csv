{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 provides leverage. You're not desperate, which allows for a bolder opening offer."
