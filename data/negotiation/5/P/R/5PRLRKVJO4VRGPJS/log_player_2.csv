Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price, especially since he has a fallback option with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  He's already negotiated with Alice for several rounds, and it's unlikely he'll get Alice to go much lower than $13,750.  Since John is selling the product for $10,000, it's a better deal for Bob."
