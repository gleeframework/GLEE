Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not sure that's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $18,000, which is $13,500. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here. However, that price is still a bit too high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $9,500 and $18,000, which is $13,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's within your budget. While she's making concessions, they aren't significant enough. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 and avoiding further potentially fruitless negotiations."
