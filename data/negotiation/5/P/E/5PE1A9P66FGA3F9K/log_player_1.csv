Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A price of $12,000 is a good starting point. It's well above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows for a final price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Stating that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the process.
* **Importance of John:**  While I want to get the best price,  knowing John's offer of $8,000 provides a safety net. This means I won't be pressured into accepting a price too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me the flexibility to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below your perceived value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the fact that $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $15,000. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone maintains a positive negotiation environment.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation, but still puts me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  It's a significant increase from his previous offer and is only $750 away from my target.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle with John at $8,000 is too high.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation process might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most reasonable choice. It's a good deal, minimizes risk, and saves me the potential headaches of further negotiation."
