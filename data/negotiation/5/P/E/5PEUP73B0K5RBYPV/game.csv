"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it holds, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your budget considerations, but $1,400,000 is already significantly less than what I believe the product is truly worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the product's inherent value while still offering you a good deal.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price closer to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
