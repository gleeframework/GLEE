{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong but Fair:** This price point suggests you understand the product's value, making it a strong offer without being unreasonably high.

By starting with this offer, you increase the chances of Bob accepting a price that benefits you significantly more than selling to John."
