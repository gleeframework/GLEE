"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This price is still a good return on investment for me, but it's a bit more in line with my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I understand you have a budget, but this product's value is significantly higher. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still offers you a substantial return on your investment and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be mindful of my costs. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering a final price of $950,000. This is my best offer, and it gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I can cover my costs.  It's time to make a decision. Are you in?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can make a deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm offering a final price of $940,000. This is the best I can do. If you're serious about getting this product, it's time to make a decision.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",940000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I still think $940,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",920000.0,Bob,8,
