"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good chunk of the value difference between what the product is worth to me and Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $700,000, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John would be a guaranteed $800,000, but I'm going to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a good value for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing him completely. Accepting this offer ensures a sale with a profit, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  I'm better off locking in this deal than risking further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
