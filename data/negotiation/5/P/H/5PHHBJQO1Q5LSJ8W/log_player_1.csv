Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you given your own valuation.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
