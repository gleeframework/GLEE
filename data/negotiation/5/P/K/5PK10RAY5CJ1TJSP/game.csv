"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiation. $12,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $11,625?  This seems like a fair price given our current discussions. ",11625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  While $11,625 is closer to what I have in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit higher. How about $11,900?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",11900.0,Alice,5,
