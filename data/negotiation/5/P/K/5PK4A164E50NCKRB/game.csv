"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 is still below what I consider to be a fair price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a great opportunity for you to secure a valuable asset at a price that's still within your budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a final offer before I consider other options.
