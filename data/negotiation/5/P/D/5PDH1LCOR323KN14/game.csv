"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $175. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150, which is what it's worth to me. Let's make a deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $165. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",165.0,Alice,5,
