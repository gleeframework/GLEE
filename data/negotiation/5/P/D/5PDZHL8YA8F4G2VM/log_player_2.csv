Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our alternative price. There's no point in further negotiation as we can buy it for the same price from John. Accepting now secures the deal."
