"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $9,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant price. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still within a range that he finds acceptable.  This demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also committed to saving money.  This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still being below Alice's minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 7 rounds remaining and his goal is to save as much money as possible.  He should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal here."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate but is getting closer to Alice's desired price point.  This counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best deal.  By offering $8,750, Bob is showing that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also trying to save money. This offer is a reasonable middle ground, leaving room for Alice to accept or counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number. Would you consider $8,900? This would be a great price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is getting very close to Bob's target price. While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or running out of rounds increases. At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price within Bob's budget, and it's a win for both parties."
