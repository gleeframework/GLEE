Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing you a profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay above the minimum value. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always propose a lower price, gradually moving towards your minimum acceptable price of $100."
