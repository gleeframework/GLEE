(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product for $120 when you can get it from John for $100.  Let's see if we can negotiate with Alice and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Let's start with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. We can likely get a better price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

Let's increase our offer slightly, but still below John's price.  It's a compromise that might convince Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to our target price, but we can still try to push for a better deal. We're only a couple of dollars away from John's price, so let's see if we can get Alice to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

Let's make one final counteroffer before considering John's deal. A small increase to $98 might be enough to get Alice to accept, especially since we've shown a willingness to negotiate."
