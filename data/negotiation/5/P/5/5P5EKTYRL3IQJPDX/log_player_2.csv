"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he shouldn't pay more than that. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget and what he can get from John.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the most financially advantageous decision."
