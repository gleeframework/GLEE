"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
