Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept given the risk of losing him entirely, it's crucial to remember that I need to earn at least $10,000.  

Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great price for the product, and it's within my acceptable range.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be open to $7,500? I think that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm eager to close the deal, $7,500 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to close the gap between our positions."
