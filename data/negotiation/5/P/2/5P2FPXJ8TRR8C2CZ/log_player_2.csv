"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $800,000? This reflects the product's true value, and it ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.

Alice's offer of $800,000 is your maximum price. You could try to negotiate lower, but you risk losing the deal to John.  Since you want the product, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
