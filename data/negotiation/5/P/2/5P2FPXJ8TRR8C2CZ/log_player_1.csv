{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob. It leaves room for bargaining while also establishing a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the product's minimum value to me ($800,000). I want to see if I can get closer to that by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $800,000? This reflects the product's true value, and it ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
