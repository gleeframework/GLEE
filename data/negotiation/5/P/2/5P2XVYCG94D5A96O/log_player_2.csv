Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $120 is less than what he would pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to him. Bob has the opportunity to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $130 is closer to what he's willing to pay, it's still more than the product is worth to him. Bob has the opportunity to negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $140 is only $10 less than John's price, and Bob has already made several counteroffers. It's likely that Alice won't budge much further. 

At this point, Bob is better off paying John and avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
