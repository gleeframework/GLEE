Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to settle comfortably at your desired profit margin.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $150, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you have the option to come down slightly. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's less risk in aiming slightly higher with Bob."
