"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth exploring further negotiation to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to land closer to his budget. Offering $9,000 is a good starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable margin for profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still $2,000 more than his ideal price.  Bob has multiple rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation to try and get closer to his $8,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to negotiate but not willing to budge too far.  $9,500 is a good compromise, still significantly lower than Alice's last offer and closer to Bob's ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is getting close to Bob's ideal price, there are still multiple rounds left and a good chance to negotiate further. It's worth pushing to see if Alice will come down further, especially since Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but Alice is also showing a willingness to negotiate.  $9,600 is a good middle ground, offering Alice a small increase from Bob's last offer while still being significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal but is not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and only $100 separates Bob from his goal. There's a risk that if Bob rejects, Alice will also reject the next counteroffer, leading to a potential breakdown in negotiation. This would force Bob to either pay more or buy from John. 

At this point, accepting the offer seems like the most sensible option to secure the product while still achieving a reasonable savings."
