"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, just below my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have to lower the price, but I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm going to try to get a better price by counter-offering. I'll see if I can push Bob closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to squeeze out a little bit more by counter-offering again.  I'm hoping Bob is getting closer to accepting a price that's more in line with what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but just slightly to $9,800. I'm hoping that this small difference will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm getting a bit nervous since we only have a few rounds left, but I'm hoping I can push Bob to agree to a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9700}
```

I'm going to try one last time with a counteroffer of $9,700.  I'm really hoping this is enough for Bob to agree. If not, I might have to accept his offer or sell to John. I'm getting close to the wire here."
