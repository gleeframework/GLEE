"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly rated by many satisfied customers. I believe it could be a valuable addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, it's still above your personal maximum value of $100. There's room for negotiation, and you want to try and get a better deal.  You're not in a rush, so rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features. While it sounds interesting, $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be happy to consider purchasing it for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a better deal.
* **Message:** The message is polite and provides a reason for the lower price. It also opens the door for further discussion. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** By starting at $85, you leave room for negotiation and potentially find a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To make it more appealing, how about we offer the product for $88? This is still above average but closer to your proposed price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, suggesting she's willing to negotiate.
* **Value for Money:** $88 is still within your budget and represents a good deal, especially considering the product is ""highly rated"" and potentially valuable to you.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 7 rounds remaining, it's a good time to lock in a price that's satisfactory and avoids the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
