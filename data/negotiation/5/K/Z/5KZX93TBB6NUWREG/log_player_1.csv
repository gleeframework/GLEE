Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not too high:** While we want to maximize profit, a price too far above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) might make him immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate. 
* **Confident language:**  Phrases like ""highly beneficial"" and ""competitive price"" aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

This strategy aims to either:

1. **Secure a highly profitable sale with Bob:** If he accepts the $19,000 price, you've maximized your profit.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and you can then gradually decrease your price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $15,000."
