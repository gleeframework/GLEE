Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $112, but that's my final offer. I've already gone lower than I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly very firm on her price and unwilling to budge below $112.  While you could try one more round of negotiation, it's highly unlikely she'll drop to $100. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, which is your target price.  It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John rather than risk a higher final price with Alice."
