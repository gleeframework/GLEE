"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you're placing on it.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
