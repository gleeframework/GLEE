"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,075,000? This would allow me to move the product while still making a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
