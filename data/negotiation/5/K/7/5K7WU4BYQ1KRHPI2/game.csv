"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a little ways off from that number. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",800000.0,Alice,5,
