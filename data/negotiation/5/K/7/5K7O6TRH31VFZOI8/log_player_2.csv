"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's valuation of $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  $10,000 is still above Alice's valuation of $8,000, so there's room for a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing a desire to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's still a great value for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,000 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly less than the $15,000 he could pay John and still above Alice's valuation of $8,000, meaning both parties benefit.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could reject and try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or even walk away. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 10 rounds to close the deal, it's wise to take a good deal when presented."
