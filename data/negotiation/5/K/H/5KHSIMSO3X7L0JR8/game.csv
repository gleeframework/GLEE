"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's well below what the product is worth to me. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $9,500?  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  Tell you what, let's split the difference. $9,250, and we have a deal.",9250.0,Bob,6,
