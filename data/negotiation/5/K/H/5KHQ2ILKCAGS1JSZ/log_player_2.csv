"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better deal.  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, but you have 9 more rounds to work with.  Buying from John immediately would cost you more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $650,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This will give me a good starting point for negotiation and hopefully incentivize Alice to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target. I'm also emphasizing my budget constraints to make my position clear."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is very close to my target price of $650,000. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely that I'll be able to get a significantly lower price, especially considering the product's value to me. Accepting the offer at $675,000 allows me to secure the product while still achieving a considerable saving.  I have 7 rounds left if I want to continue negotiating, but I'm comfortable with this price and want to avoid the risk of not getting the product."
