Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you halfway at this point. I'll offer the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:  Alice seems firm on a price above $11,000.  At this point, further haggling is unlikely to yield a price significantly better than John's offer of $15,000.  Cutting my losses now is the most rational choice."
