# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget.  What do you think?
