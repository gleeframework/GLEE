It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,200,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation."

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her original offer, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'll reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is close to my ideal price point, and it's likely we won't get a better deal. Accepting this offer saves a significant amount compared to buying from John."
