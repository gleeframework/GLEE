"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While the product might be great, Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This establishes his willingness to negotiate and sets a strong starting point. $14,000 is still within his budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  Since John is offering the product for $15,000, Bob can use that as a benchmark in his negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $15,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing flexibility. He's offering to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and his desired price. This strategy demonstrates his seriousness in buying the product while still working to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $16250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown some flexibility, her latest offer is still above Bob's target price and is only slightly lower than her previous offer.  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a better deal. Since John is offering the product for $15,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's a more financially advantageous decision to buy from John at this point."
