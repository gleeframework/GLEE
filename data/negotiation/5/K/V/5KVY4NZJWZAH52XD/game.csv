"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $15500? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $16250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",16250.0,Alice,5,
