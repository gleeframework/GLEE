"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value and my original asking price. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
