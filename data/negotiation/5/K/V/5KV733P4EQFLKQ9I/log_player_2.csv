"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to bargain before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to move. This tactic leaves room for negotiation while still being a price that would save me a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved a significant amount from her initial offer, indicating flexibility. However, her current offer is still $50,000 more than John's price. It's worth making another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair offer considering the value and my budget."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly below John's offer and closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value and my original asking price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our bottom line. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price matches what we can get from John. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or going with John at this point."
