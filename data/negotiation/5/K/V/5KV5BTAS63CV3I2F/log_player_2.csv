"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. A $100,000 discount is a good start, but there's likely room for more savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit away from meeting my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we try $1,050,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

``` 

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. While you initially aimed for $1,000,000, the extra $50,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John or accepting Alice's first offer."
