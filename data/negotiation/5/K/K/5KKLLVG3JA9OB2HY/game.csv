"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I acknowledge the product's value, $900000 is a bit too far below my desired price point. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1050000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1075000?  This would allow both of us to walk away with a successful deal.  I'm confident that this is a fair price point for both parties.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1075000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1080000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
