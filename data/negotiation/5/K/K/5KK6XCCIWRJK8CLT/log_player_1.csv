Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it would be a valuable asset for you, and this is a very competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything less than that.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Balancing profit and likelihood of sale:** While offering a price closer to $15,000 might net you more profit, it increases the chance of Bob rejecting the offer. $14,000 balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob walking away."
