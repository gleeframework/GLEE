Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80),** giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price ($120),** leaving room for potential concessions. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer,** making it easy for Bob to understand. 

By offering this price, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but it's also important to be reasonable and see if a deal can be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also below the perceived value of the product for him ($80).  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.  

While selling to John for $120 is tempting, it's worth exploring if you can reach a more favorable deal with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer is Above Bob's Value:**  $85 is still above Bob's perceived value of $80, potentially incentivizing him to accept.
* **Counter Offer is Below Your Minimum:** This counteroffer is below your minimum acceptable price of $120, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Reasoning Provided:**  The message clearly explains your reasoning for the counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and fairness.

This counteroffer positions you for a potentially successful negotiation while still ensuring you get a reasonable price."
