"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Is that something you'd consider?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? ",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $115, but I'm still not getting my desired price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $125. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
