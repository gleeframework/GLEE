Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  I'm really interested, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  I think that would make a deal more likely. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $875,000.  This would be a great price for both of us, allowing me to acquire this product and you to still make a good profit.
