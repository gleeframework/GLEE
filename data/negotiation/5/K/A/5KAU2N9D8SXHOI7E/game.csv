"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?,95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
