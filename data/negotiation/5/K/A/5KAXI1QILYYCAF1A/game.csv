"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it can bring to your business. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. While I acknowledge the product's potential value, I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,050,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value to me, and I'm confident it's a reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  We're getting closer to an agreement, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
