"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,250,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a significant benefit, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can we meet in the middle at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum threshold, and I've already made two counteroffers.  It's not clear if we'll be able to reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, so I'll take that option."
