Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's a fair starting point considering the product is worth $150 to both of us.  I'm hoping to get a bit more than my minimum value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $160 is acceptable. It's more than my minimum value of $150 and it avoids further negotiation."
