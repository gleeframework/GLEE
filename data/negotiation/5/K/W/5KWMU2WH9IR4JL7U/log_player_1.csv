Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing our minimum is $12,000 from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($11,000) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob, even though it's above his perceived value. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning another buyer adds pressure for Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, it positions us to potentially get a much higher price than selling directly to John."
