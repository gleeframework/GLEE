"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's intent to negotiate. It's a bold move, but if Alice is motivated to sell, she may consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above Bob's target. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try to drive the price down.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly but surely pushing Alice towards his desired price point. This offer is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway, but still leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is keen on closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point, and he's already made a significant counteroffer.  There are still rounds left, and Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to close the deal at a price closer to his target.  He's already established that he's serious about getting a good price, so it's worthwhile to keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price.  He's showing a willingness to negotiate, and this offer might be enough to tempt Alice into closing the deal. If Alice rejects again, Bob will have to consider if he's willing to risk buying from John for a higher price or risk losing out entirely.  This offer is a calculated risk, but it's a step in the right direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he's still got a few rounds left to try and drive the price down further.  Alice has been willing to negotiate, so there's a chance she might be willing to go lower if Bob persists.  Bob is still ahead of where he'd be buying from John, so he's got some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer.  It shows Bob is willing to be flexible, but still wants to get a good deal. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to seriously consider buying from John, as he's likely to run out of time to negotiate further. This offer is a last push to get a better price before potentially having to settle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round of negotiation with Alice.  While $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not ideal.  Given the limited time and the fact that Alice has repeatedly rejected his counteroffers, there is a strong likelihood that she won't budge further. 

It's better for Bob to purchase the product from John at $1,500,000, rather than risk getting a worse price or no deal at all.  He has a firm price from John, and at this point, the time constraint makes it more advantageous to buy from John and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
