Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum ($150) but it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price higher based on his counteroffer or I can choose to go with John's offer if I feel like the negotiation isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and it's getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum price and guarantees I get a decent profit."
