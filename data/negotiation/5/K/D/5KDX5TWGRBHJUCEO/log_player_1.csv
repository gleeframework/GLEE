Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it's worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting the price at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to a reasonable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll try to push for a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But I can't go lower than $105.  This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
