Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

Since the product is worth $100 to Bob and he is willing to pay that much, offering it to him at $100 ensures I get the maximum possible price while still making a sale. This guarantees I get the best possible outcome, as any price higher than $100 risks losing the sale and forcing me to sell to John for $100."
