Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I can still potentially get a better deal with Bob, or I can sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price for a product worth so much. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate further? I'm suggesting an offer of $8,200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,200 is still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm not desperate, and I'm confident I can either push Bob further or sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,200 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm offering a final compromise of $8,400. This is the lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile deal for me.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 8400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. My budget remains firm at $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your considerations. Thank you for your time and understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he won't budge from his $8,000 offer.  While that's a decent amount, I've already made several compromises and I'm not willing to go lower. With John offering a guaranteed $10,000, it makes more financial sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
