"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price for a product worth so much. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate further? I'm suggesting an offer of $8,200.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,200 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm offering a final compromise of $8,400. This is the lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile deal for me.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",8400.0,Alice,5,
