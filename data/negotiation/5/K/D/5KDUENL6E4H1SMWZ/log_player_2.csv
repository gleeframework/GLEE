Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $8,000 offer.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
