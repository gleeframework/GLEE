"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe is fair.  How does $12,000 sound?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for a better price from John ($10,000). Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer, or you can proceed to purchase from John and maximize your savings."
