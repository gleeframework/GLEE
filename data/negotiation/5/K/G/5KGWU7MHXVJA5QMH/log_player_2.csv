"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. My starting price is $900,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $900,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is lower than my initial ask, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and also gives you a fair price. Let's work together to bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob can try to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm feeling confident about a deal at $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me, and it's within my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
