"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. My starting price is $900,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is lower than my initial ask, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and also gives you a fair price. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm feeling confident about a deal at $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me, and it's within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
