Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The tone remains professional and doesn't undervalue the product or pressure Bob.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
