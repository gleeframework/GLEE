Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth a million dollars in the right hands. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's potential value, we create a reason for the high price, even if the exact value is not explicitly stated.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""I'm willing to offer"" and ""What do you think?"" signals that the price is not final and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, we are not at risk of ending up with nothing."
