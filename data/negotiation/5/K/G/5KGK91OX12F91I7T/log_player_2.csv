Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,000,000. I think the product is worth more to you than that, and I'm willing to go a bit higher to reflect that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $1,050,000.  While I could try to push her further, the difference of $75,000 isn't worth the risk of her walking away or the additional time spent negotiating.  This offer is a good compromise and allows me to stay well within my budget."
