"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $1,000,000.  If you're willing to meet that, I'll sign right now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,000,000. I think the product is worth more to you than that, and I'm willing to go a bit higher to reflect that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
