"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm confident that Bob will at least consider this offer, as it's significantly less than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired profit margin. This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, while also signaling that I won't settle for significantly less."
