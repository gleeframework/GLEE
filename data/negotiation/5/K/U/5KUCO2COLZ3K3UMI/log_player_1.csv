"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a fair starting point considering my minimum value is $120 and I want to maximize profit.  Since Bob values the product at $80, I'm giving him some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves some room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.5 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hesitant to accept. I think I can push for a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $120, as I feel there is still potential to make a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still making a profit and it shows my willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this and finally agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a while, and we seem to be stuck at an impasse.  While I would prefer to make a higher profit, I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price or continuing this back-and-forth.  John's offer provides me with a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
