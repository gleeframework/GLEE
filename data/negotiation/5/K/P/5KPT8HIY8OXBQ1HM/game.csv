"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for this quality of product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is my final offer.  Let's close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
