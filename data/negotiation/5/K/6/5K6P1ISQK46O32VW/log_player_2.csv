"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and also lower than what I'd pay John ($800,000).  I can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 feels a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is still lower than the product's value to me ($800,000), but it's a good compromise. I can save $75,000 compared to buying from John, and I'm not sure I can negotiate a better price with Alice."
