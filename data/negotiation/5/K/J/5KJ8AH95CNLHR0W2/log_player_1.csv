"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth and represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,075,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and moving towards our desired price point. It's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,100,000.  This represents a significant investment from your side, but I believe the product's value will more than justify it in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer.  By framing this as a ""final offer,"" we add weight to the negotiation and signal we're firm on this price. This could encourage Bob to accept or counter with a number very close to our goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now twice offered $1,050,000 and called it his final offer. It's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting this offer secures a $50,000 profit over John's offer, and continuing the negotiation has a high risk of stalling completely."
