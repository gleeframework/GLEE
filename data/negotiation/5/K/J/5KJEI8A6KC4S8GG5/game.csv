"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $70?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $85.  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $95. I've already compromised a lot from my initial offer. I think $95 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
