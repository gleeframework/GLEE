I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
