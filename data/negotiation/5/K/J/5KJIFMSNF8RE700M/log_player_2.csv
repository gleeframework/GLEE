Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $12,750. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

Alice is very consistently working her way down, and we're running out of rounds to get her to budge much further.  It's unlikely she'll go below $12,000 and we know we can get it for $10,000 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
