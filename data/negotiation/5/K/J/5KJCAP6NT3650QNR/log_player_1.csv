"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm aware Bob values the product at $10,000, so this is a significant markup. However, I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails, so I have some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum price of $15,000. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that this is a fair price considering my minimum value and his potential profit.  If he doesn't, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price, and I have the option of selling to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000, hoping to find a compromise.  I'm still above my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm willing to concede a bit to reach a deal.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $12,500 is still too low for me, and we are running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get a good deal by selling to John.  It's important to recognize when to walk away from a negotiation, especially when a guaranteed alternative exists."
