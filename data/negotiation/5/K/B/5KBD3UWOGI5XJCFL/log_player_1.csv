Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a sale that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,500 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. How about we try $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $8,750 is getting closer, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident I can get Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $9,000? I think this would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I've done my research, and I believe that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been persistent in sticking to his $8,500 price point, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's becoming clear that he's not going to budge.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my desired price. Therefore, I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 offer from John and sell the product to him."
