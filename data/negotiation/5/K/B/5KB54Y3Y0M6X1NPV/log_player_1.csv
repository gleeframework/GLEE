"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"",

}
```

This is a classic negotiation tactic where we start high to leave room for negotiation.  We don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous number, but we also want to aim for a price significantly above his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a tempting offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to go higher than his initial perceived value. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows us to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's unique benefits.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're strategically moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above his perceived value. We're highlighting the product's benefits again to justify the higher price and using language that encourages a deal without seeming overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand the product's unique benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $14,000, which is a significant jump from his previous offer. While it's still below our ideal price, it's now a strong offer considering:

* **Time Investment:**  We've already spent four rounds negotiating, and further rounds may not yield significantly better results. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or getting stuck at a lower price point. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely.

While selling to John guarantees $15,000, accepting Bob's offer for $14,000 is a reasonable compromise that provides a good return and avoids further negotiation."
