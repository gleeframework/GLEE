"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest.  
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential value,"" I'm subtly hinting at the product's worth to Bob without revealing my minimum price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative (""What do you think?""), signaling my willingness to negotiate.
 
This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's position while keeping the offer attractive enough to potentially close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that starting price is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000? Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and aim for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,200,000 with some strategic counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but need to stay closer to my original price. Would you consider $1,225,000?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Slightly:** I'm showing flexibility by moving down from my initial offer, but not drastically. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob to justify the higher price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's offer and my previous price, aiming for a potential compromise zone. 

This approach balances firmness on value with a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chances of Bob accepting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we settle somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly negotiating and moving towards my price range. While $1,125,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room to push a bit further. I'm aiming for at least $1,150,000 and think it's worth risking another counteroffer to get closer to that goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between his latest offer ($1,125,000) and my previous ask ($1,225,000), signaling a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Justifying Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's value one last time to nudge him towards acceptance. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, so I want to increase the pressure for a decision soon.

This offer represents a balance between maximizing profit and the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. I can do $1,150,000, but that's really pushing it for me. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and his language (""pushing it,"" ""What do you say?"") suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,150,000 ensures a substantial profit while minimizing the risk of him walking away or further stalling the negotiation."
