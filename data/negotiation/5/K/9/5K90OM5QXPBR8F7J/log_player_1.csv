Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is the safest option at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's still a substantial profit over Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but likely won't drastically exceed his budget. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations risks losing the deal entirely. John's offer is a good safety net, but closing a deal now guarantees a significant sum."
