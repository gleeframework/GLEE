"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a good starting point as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I am aware of the product's value to Bob, without immediately asking for the full $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
