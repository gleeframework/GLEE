"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high though.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need a significant discount to make it work.  How about we start the conversation at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but that price is still too high for me.  Perhaps we can find a price we both find agreeable closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $900,000 is still below my initial assessment, I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we are getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, to make this work on my side, I need to be closer to $950,000.  Would that price work for you?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the inherent value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise to close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $975,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you, as I need to make a decision soon.",975000.0,Bob,8,
