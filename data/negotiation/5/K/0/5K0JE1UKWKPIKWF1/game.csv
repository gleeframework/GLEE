"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $750,000?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to settle at $700,000?  That's the highest I can go.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $750,000. How about we aim for $725,000?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to my limit. I'd be willing to do $710,000, but that's really as high as I can go.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $710,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $720,000?",720000.0,Alice,7,
