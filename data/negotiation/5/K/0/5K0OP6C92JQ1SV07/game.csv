"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,150,000, so I'll offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
