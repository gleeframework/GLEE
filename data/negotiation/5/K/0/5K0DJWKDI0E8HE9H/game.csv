"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,200,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer, I need to be around $700,000 for this to work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere near there?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your budget, but $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  Let's try to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I can tell we both want to make this work.  How about $800,000?  That's my final offer.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
