"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,200,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer, I need to be around $700,000 for this to work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere near there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is closer, it's still significantly less than what I need to get for this product. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have your budget, but $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  Let's try to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I can tell we both want to make this work.  How about $800,000?  That's my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I've already gone through 5 rounds and Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much better deal for me, and it avoids the risk of losing more time and getting a worse outcome with Bob."
