"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [Product Name] at a price that's sure to be attractive. I understand its value to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Please consider my offer carefully, as I'm sure you'll agree it's a chance you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is $1,500,000.**  This is also above your maximum budget, but it's still a better deal than Alice's offer. 
* **Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy.** 

While you won't be able to get the product for your ideal price, you'll still be able to purchase it while staying within your budget."
