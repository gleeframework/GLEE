Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming high to see how much I can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and leaves some room for further negotiation, while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer, I'm happy to accept this price and avoid further negotiation. It's a better outcome than selling to John for $15,000."
