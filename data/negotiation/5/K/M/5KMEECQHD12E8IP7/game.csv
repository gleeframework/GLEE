"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low.  $700,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $750,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000? This is the absolute minimum I can accept, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",775000.0,Bob,6,
