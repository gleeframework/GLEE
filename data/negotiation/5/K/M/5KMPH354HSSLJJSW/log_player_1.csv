Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good offer, I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident Bob is willing to pay more, and I'm not yet ready to settle for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to him."
