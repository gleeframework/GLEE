"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still a significant amount over your desired price point. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.** There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** John's price is your absolute limit, and you'll be spending more than necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** My counteroffer of $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120. This shows I'm serious about buying but am also looking for a good deal.
* **Within My Budget:** $100 is still within my budget of $150, so I'm not risking overspending.
* **Fair Compromise:** This price is a good starting point for further negotiation, offering a potential compromise that could be mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better than John's Price:**  Alice's offer of $110 is significantly better than buying from John for $150.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While still above my desired price, it's a reasonable compromise considering Alice rejected my previous offer.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, but also the risk of Alice walking away or me losing time. Accepting her offer is the safest and most cost-effective choice."
