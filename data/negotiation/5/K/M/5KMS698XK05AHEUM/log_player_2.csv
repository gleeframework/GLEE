"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity given to you based on your interest in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special opportunity. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose we settle on $13,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,000.** This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than John's offer of $15,000. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob losing time and potentially losing the product altogether.**  At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk.

Therefore, accepting the offer at $13,000 is the most strategic decision for Bob to achieve his goal of buying the product while saving money."
