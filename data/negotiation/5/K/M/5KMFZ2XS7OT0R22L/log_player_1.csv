"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping to see if Bob is willing to pay that much.  If he rejects, I can then start negotiating down, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by dropping my price to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for me, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm not going to go below $1,050,000. This is getting closer to Bob's valuation, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make before potentially going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still not a good enough price for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm starting to worry about running out of time, so I need to be careful not to get too greedy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to try to close the deal with Bob at $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's his valuation, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely go to John to secure the $1,200,000."
