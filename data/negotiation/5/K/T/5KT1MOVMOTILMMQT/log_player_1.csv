"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Reasoned Offer:** I'm not starting at an outrageous price.  I'm still within the realm of what Bob might consider, given his perceived value of $80.
* **Open to Discussion:** My message is friendly and inviting, suggesting I'm open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to sell for less than $100. 
* **I have room to negotiate.**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to show I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is still friendly and emphasizes a fair outcome for both parties.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** While Bob is coming down in price, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $100 is still a solid backup, giving me confidence to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down further to $90. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, but showing I'm flexible by making a counteroffer.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $90, which is closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm using persuasive language to suggest we're both making concessions and moving towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum price, so it's a reasonable offer for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $82 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  There's only a little room left for negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will come up significantly.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is guaranteed to buy the product for $100. This is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer, and I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate with Bob. 

It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more profitable deal with John."
