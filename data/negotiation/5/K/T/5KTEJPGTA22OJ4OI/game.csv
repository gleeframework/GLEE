"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product seems interesting, $950000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit high, but I believe the product's value is still substantial. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850000. This is a more reasonable price, considering the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for adjusting your offer.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $750000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $800000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $775000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,6,
