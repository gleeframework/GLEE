{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, there's potential to save more. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This will test her willingness to negotiate.  If she rejects this offer, I'll have room to adjust my counteroffer in the following rounds."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming for a lower cost. I'll continue negotiating and try to push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to settle for a price that's too high.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have more information to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $7,200, which is closer to my target price of $6,800. While I'd prefer to get it even lower,  we're getting close to the middle ground.  Considering the limited number of rounds left, it's safer to accept this offer and secure the product than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's price."
