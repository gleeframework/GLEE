"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. Since you have 10 rounds and the maximum you're willing to spend is $800,000, there's no immediate need to buy from John.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's considerably lower than Alice's initial offer. This aggressive approach aims to establish a strong bargaining position early on, potentially encouraging Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $450,000 is closer to my target, I still have room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further.  Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but still  aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  This gradual increase helps to signal my willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $437,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $437,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $437,500 is very close to my target price and I'm happy with this deal.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm getting close to my budget and the risk of Alice rejecting my offer is increasing. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price with minimal risk."
