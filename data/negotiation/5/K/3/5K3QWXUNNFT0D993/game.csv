,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but $130 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70? That's a pretty big jump from my last offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate.  While $70 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $100 to see if we can close this deal. This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
