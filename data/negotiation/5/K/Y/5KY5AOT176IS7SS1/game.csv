"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $950,000 is significantly below what I need to consider selling.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
