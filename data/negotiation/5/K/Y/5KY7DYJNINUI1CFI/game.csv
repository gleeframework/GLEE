"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price would be fair for both of us, allowing me to move forward with the sale and still keeping you within your budget.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
