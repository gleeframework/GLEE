{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation.  A lower starting point increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation and allows for a greater potential savings for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation. It's likely you can reach a mutually agreeable price, especially since the current offer is closer to your target than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's a reasonable price point that shows a willingness to negotiate while still remaining within your budget. This should encourage Alice to accept, as it's closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her price with each rejection, making it unlikely that a reasonable compromise will be reached.  At this point, the offer from John is the better option as it's still lower than Alice's last offer and guarantees you'll acquire the product.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of a higher price or a stalled deal, making John the more reliable choice."
