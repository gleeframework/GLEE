Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($1,200,000) at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still aiming for a price above Bob's valuation. 
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** The safety net of John's offer at your minimum allows for a bolder approach with Bob.

**The Message:**

The message is crafted to be persuasive without revealing your bottom line. It emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob."
