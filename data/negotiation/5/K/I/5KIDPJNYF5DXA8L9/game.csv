"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] for a price that I believe offers significant value.  While I can't disclose the specifics of the product's worth to me,  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for the right buyer.  I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm initially proposing a figure of $1800000. This price reflects the potential value I see in the product, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
