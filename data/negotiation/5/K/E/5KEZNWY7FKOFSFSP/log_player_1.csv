Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't sell for less.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values it at $10,000, so he won't pay more.
* **Negotiation space:**  We have a $5,000 difference to negotiate.
* **Initial offer:**  I'm offering $13,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum but leaves room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher counter-offer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counter-offer and decide:
    * **Accept:** If his counter-offer is close to my minimum, I'll consider it.
    * **Reject & Counter:** If his counter-offer is too low, I'll make a counter-offer closer to my initial offer.
    * **Walk away:** If the negotiations seem unproductive, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $11,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $13,000 and still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, it's risky. If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee I can negotiate a better deal with him.
* **Continuing negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially getting closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $13,000, leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Evaluate Bob's response:**  Based on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to continue negotiating, accept his counter-offer, or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm willing to lower my price from $13,000 to $12,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This shows Bob that I'm serious about a deal but also maintains a reasonable margin for myself.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $12,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $11,000. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation and encourages Bob to make a higher counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  By not going too low, I leave room for a final counteroffer if necessary, while still considering Bob's possible counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:**  I will analyze Bob's reaction to my counteroffer.
* **Final negotiation:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to decide whether to make a final counteroffer or sell to John. 
* **Accepting a deal:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and very close to Bob's initial offer of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation progress:** The negotiation has stalled. Bob's offer is not improving, and further negotiation might lead to a longer process without a guarantee of a better price.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum desired price and is the most profitable option. This eliminates the risk of further negotiations failing.

**Next steps:**

* **Final decision:** I'll proceed to sell the product to John for $15,000, ending the negotiation with Bob."
