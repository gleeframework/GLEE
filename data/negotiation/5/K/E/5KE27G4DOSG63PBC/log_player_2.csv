**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling for $925,000, while John is selling for $1,000,000. This means accepting Alice's offer saves you $75,000.
* **The product is worth more to you:** Even at $925,000, the product is still worth more to you than it is to Alice ($800,000), making it a good deal."
