"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is only $800 more than Bob's maximum price from John. Given that Bob has already rejected a counteroffer, it's unlikely Alice will go lower. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for a price close to his limit and avoids further negotiation."
