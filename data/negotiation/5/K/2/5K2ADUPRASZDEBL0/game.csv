"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me.

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1000000 just yet. I'm willing to make one final push for a higher price.
