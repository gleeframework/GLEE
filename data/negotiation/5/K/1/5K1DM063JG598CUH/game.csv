"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. Would you consider $108? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",108.0,Bob,4,
