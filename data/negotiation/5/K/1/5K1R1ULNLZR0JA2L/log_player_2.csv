"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and my proposal aims to strike a balance that benefits us equally. I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a price of $950,000. This offer not only allows you to secure an asset that aligns perfectly with your needs and aspirations but also ensures a significant return on investment. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product while providing you with a substantial discount compared to its market value. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of creating a mutually beneficial partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exaggerating the product's worth to you. While it might be worth $1,000,000 to some, you know your upper limit. Her offer of $950,000 is still considerably higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed with buying from John at a lower price."
