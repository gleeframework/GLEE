"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to make one final concession. If you're serious about buying, I'm offering the product for $1300000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1275000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  We've been through several rounds now, and I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1290000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
