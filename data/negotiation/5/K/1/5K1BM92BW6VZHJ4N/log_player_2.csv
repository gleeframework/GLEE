"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $8,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both our interests. Considering the product's quality and exclusivity, I suggest we aim for a price slightly above the cost of production but still reasonable. Would you be interested in discussing this further? I'm open to negotiation and am eager to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
