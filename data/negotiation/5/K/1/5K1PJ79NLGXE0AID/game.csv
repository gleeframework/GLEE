"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price of $9,500. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire a truly unique item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $7,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but $7,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $8,500? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $7,500, which I think is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $8,200? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work.",8200.0,Alice,5,
