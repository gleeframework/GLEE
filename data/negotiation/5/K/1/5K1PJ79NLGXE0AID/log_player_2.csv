Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but $7,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $8,500? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $8,200? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200. While she might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of the price remaining above your $8,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which meets your budget and avoids further negotiation."
