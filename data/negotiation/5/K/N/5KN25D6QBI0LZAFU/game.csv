,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $80? That's the absolute most I'm able to spend right now.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer you the product for 100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but my absolute max is $95. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy it now.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 95. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for 105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",105.0,Alice,7,
