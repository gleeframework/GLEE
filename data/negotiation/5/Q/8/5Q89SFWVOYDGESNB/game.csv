"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's too low for me. Given the product's value and my own investment in it, I can't go lower than $10500.  This is still a great price for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than it's worth to you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
