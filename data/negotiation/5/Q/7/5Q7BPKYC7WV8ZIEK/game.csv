"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $160, which is still a great deal for a product like this. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $160. How about we say $152? I think it's a fair price for a product like this.",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $152 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, so I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",130.0,Bob,6,
