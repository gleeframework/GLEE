"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for a special introductory price of $950,000. This exceptional opportunity is tailored to meet your needs and expectations, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this offer presents an attractive balance between value and cost, ensuring both parties benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. The goal is to save as much money as possible, so simply accepting the first offer wouldn't be the most strategic move.  Buying from John is also not ideal since it's the most expensive option."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to secure the product for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still represents a significant profit for you. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has accepted Bob's counteroffer of $850,000. This is a great deal for Bob, as he is getting the product for $350,000 less than what he would pay John. There is no reason to continue negotiating or go to John at this point."
