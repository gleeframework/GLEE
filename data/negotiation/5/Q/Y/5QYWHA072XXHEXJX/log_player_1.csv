"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate.  It's also not an unreasonable price for a product worth at least $100. I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer of $100, it's still better than selling to John for the same price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. I have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to be a little more patient and see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to get a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to what I want.  Since I have several rounds left, it's not a huge risk to accept this offer.  I'm confident that I can get a better price, but it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether."
