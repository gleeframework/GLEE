"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more from my initial offer. How about $110? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really looking for a deal in the $90 range.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get the product for around $98.  I'm willing to pay $98.50, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",98.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $98.50 is still too low for me.  How about $100? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,7,
