"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent discount from Alice's valuation, it's still above my maximum budget of $80. It's better to reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within my budget. This is a good starting point for negotiations, and I hope to reach a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more from my initial offer. How about $110? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better offer than $130, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll try a counteroffer again to see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really looking for a deal in the $90 range.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise. $95 is still a significant saving for Alice, and it's close to my maximum budget. I'm hoping she will accept this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $102.50 is lower than her previous offers, it's still above my maximum budget of $80.  I'm  confident I can get a better deal, so I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating. I'll try a counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get the product for around $98.  I'm willing to pay $98.50, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 98.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a price very close to my maximum budget, but still offering a decent deal for Alice. I'm showing her that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $98.50 is still too low for me.  How about $100? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I've already negotiated for several rounds and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower. I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing out on a deal with John. I'm better off buying from John for $80 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
