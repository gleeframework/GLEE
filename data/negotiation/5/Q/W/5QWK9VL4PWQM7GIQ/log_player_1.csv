"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum value ($150). This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while still giving me a good profit.
* I'm aiming for a win-win situation, creating a positive and open atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $150 and even lower than my initial offer of $130. 
* I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in subsequent rounds, considering he acknowledged the value of the product by offering a price higher than his initial assessment.
* I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal, and I still have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more from my initial offer. How about $110? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* I'm trying to maintain a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product. 
* By offering $110, I'm leaving room for further negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really looking for a deal in the $90 range.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $95 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can secure a better price through continued negotiation.
* I'm also considering the fact that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer reflects a gradual increase in his perceived value of the product.
* With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample time to push for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $102.50, which is the average of his offer ($95) and my previous offer ($110).
* This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* I'm still above my minimum value of $150, but I'm hoping to close the deal before reaching my ""sell to John"" threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get the product for around $98.  I'm willing to pay $98.50, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $98.5 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to earn.  With 4 rounds remaining, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'm also seeing a pattern of Bob increasing his offer incrementally, so I'm hoping to see that trend continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $98.50 is still too low for me.  How about $100? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm countering Bob's offer by meeting him halfway again, offering $100, the average of his offer ($98.50) and my previous offer ($102.50). 
* This demonstrates a continued willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* With only 3 rounds left, I'm aiming to close the deal at a price that's still above my minimum while not risking going too low."
