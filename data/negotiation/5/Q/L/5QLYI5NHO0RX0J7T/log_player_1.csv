Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and based on my understanding, it could be worth $1,500,000 to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** While we know John offers a fallback, aiming high initially allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal.
* **Strategic Discount:** Offering the product for $1,400,000 presents Bob with a compelling discount of $100,000. This makes the offer psychologically appealing and increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Open Communication:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob and invites his thoughts, fostering a collaborative tone that can lead to a successful negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We're prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or has concerns. The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring the deal goes through."
