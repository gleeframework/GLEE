"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $110?  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Can you consider this offer?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110, but I can't go any lower than that. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be satisfied with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
