"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,250,000.  That's a fair price given the value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,250,000 is a significant sum, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm confident it can generate much more than that for you in the long run.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,325,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  Let's split the difference again and go with $1,300,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
