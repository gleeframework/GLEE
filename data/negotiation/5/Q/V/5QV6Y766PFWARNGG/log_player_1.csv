Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, but not too high to scare Bob off immediately. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing some flexibility while keeping the price above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not confident I can push him higher. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the best choice in this situation."
