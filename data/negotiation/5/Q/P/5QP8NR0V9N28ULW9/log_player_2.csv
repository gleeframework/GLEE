**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very slowly moving towards our desired price point. At this point, the difference between her offer ($10,650) and our ideal price ($10,000) is getting smaller.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively might backfire, and we risk her settling closer to the $11,000 mark.  

It's better to secure a good deal now ($10,650) than to risk ending up with a higher price or having to settle for John's offer of $12,000."
