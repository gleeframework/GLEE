Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting high, I create space for Bob to counteroffer and we can hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Acceptable:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not going to make a counteroffer and risk him walking away completely.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers the same price, I'm not sure if I can be confident he will actually buy the product.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale."
