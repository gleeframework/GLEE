Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? This is still a good value for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
