"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? This is still a good value for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $80.  That's fair for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
