"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. As we've discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This price still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Bob can get a better deal. There is a chance that Alice may be willing to go lower, especially if she's keen to sell the product quickly."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This price is getting closer to my minimum, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's no guarantee that Alice will go any lower.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, as this ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate."
