"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. As we've discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and is a fair starting point for further negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This price still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still slightly beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on it and is a fair compromise, considering your previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This price is getting closer to my minimum, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
