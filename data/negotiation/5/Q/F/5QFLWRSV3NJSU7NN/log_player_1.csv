Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob to encourage him to engage.
* **Not Too Aggressive:** While I want to maximize my profit, I don't want to immediately scare Bob away with an exorbitant price. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to counteroffer if needed. This allows for a more dynamic negotiation.

**Note:**  I'm keeping John in mind as my backup option.  This provides leverage if Bob becomes too hesitant or demanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **John as Leverage:**  The fact that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.  Knowing this, I can be more assertive in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I frame it as a ""good deal for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage a positive response.
* **Maintain Leverage:** While I'm offering a lower price, it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum desired price. I'm also not committing to accepting his offer outright, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

**Note:** I'm still aware of John's offer as a backup. If Bob becomes too stubborn, I can always choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is closer to our previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Limited Upside:** There's not much room for further negotiation.  Even if I were to counter with a price closer to his, he may still reject it, prolonging the process and potentially leading to a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer guarantees me my desired price, eliminating the risk and uncertainty associated with further negotiations with Bob.

**Conclusion:** Given the current situation, selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the potential for a protracted negotiation that may not result in a favorable outcome."
