"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you and a good starting point for our negotiation.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,400,000.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,312,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we may not be able to reach an agreement.  $1,312,500 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,318,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both committed to making this deal happen. What do you say?",1318750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,318,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,314,375? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to make this deal happen.",1314375.0,Bob,8,
