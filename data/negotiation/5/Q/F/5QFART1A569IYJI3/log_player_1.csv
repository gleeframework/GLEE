Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher by mentioning a public listing, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $15,000 allows for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than your minimum of $10,000.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
