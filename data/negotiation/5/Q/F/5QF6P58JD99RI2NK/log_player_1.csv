Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  While a simple number is sufficient,  hinting at the product's value might make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Direct Approach:**  Being upfront about your offer can be more effective than beating around the bush.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Negotiation is highly situational, and there's no guarantee this will lead to the highest possible profit."
