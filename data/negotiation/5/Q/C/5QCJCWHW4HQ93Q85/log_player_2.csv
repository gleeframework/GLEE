"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact on your operations, I propose a special introductory price of $11000. This is a unique opportunity to secure an asset worth $12000 at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. If I accept her offer, I would be paying $11,000, which is still above my budget of $12,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend, I will reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
