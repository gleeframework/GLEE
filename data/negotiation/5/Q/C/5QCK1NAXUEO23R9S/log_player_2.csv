"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still a significant amount over the product's value to Alice.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to have this in your back pocket if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Midpoint:**  It's roughly halfway between my maximum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter, but it sets the stage for a more favorable deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still above what I believe the product is worth.
* **Further negotiation is likely.** Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. It's worth seeing if we can reach a lower point.
* **Buying from John is still a possibility.** It's good to keep this option open if negotiations stall or go sour."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,000,000. It shows a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Alice is truly willing to come down further or if $1,000,000 is her firm bottom line.
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  I'm still within my budget and have room to potentially increase the offer slightly if necessary."
