Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum price. This allows room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of a deal while still leaving me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,000,000, which is still a good profit for me and shows my willingness to compromise. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to meet my minimum requirement of $1,200,000. I've already engaged in two rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems like we're not reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John, ensuring I get the value I need."
