"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is your maximum price. However, you don't know the value of the product to Alice, so it's possible she would be willing to sell it for less. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially get a better deal from another seller or even negotiate a lower price with Alice."
