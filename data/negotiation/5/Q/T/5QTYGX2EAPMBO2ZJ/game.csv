"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a little high for me. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
