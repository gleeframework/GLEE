Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $15,000 is the lowest I can go.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you.

Alice is at her lowest price and it matches the price John is offering.  There's no benefit to further negotiation."
