"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I have to make sure I'm also getting a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting the product at a discount, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $127.50? That gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",127.5,Alice,5,
