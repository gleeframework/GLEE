"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $15,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $13,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000. It's the maximum I can pay, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $12,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
