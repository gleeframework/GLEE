"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $15,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. There's no reason to accept it immediately.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $13,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum $10,000 limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000. It's the maximum I can pay, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $12,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  Although we're getting closer, it's unlikely she'll come down to my price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
