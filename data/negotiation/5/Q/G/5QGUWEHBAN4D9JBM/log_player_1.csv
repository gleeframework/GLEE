Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more than that! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than my minimum but still leaves room for potential counteroffers and a win-win situation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to $130. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $125? Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was really hoping to get it for a bit cheaper. Would you be willing to go down to $122? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $122 is still a good deal for me. It's more than what John is offering, and Bob seems determined to get the product at that price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
