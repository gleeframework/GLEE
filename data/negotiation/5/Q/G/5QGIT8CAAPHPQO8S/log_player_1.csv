"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate.  I'm also leaving some room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm going to try and get closer to my initial price. There are still 8 rounds left and I'd like to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also suggests that I believe the product is worth more.  I'm hoping this price point will be appealing enough for Bob, but not so low that it's not worth continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum value and the price John is willing to pay. I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, but I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $16,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to move closer to Bob's price. However, it's still above my minimum value and leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is below my minimum value and I only have 4 rounds remaining. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal increases with each round. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum value and avoids further risk."
