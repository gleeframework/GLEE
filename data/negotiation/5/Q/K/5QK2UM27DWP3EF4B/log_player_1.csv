"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than John's $120 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired $150 by continuing the negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still above his offer, and closer to my initial asking price. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob's offer is only $10 more than John's offer, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price of $135. This is a compromise from my previous offer and shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  It's also a significant increase from his last offer, and I'm hoping that this will be enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I've already rejected his previous offer and I'm confident I can push him to meet me closer to my asking price. There are still 4 rounds left, and I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 132}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $132. This shows Bob that I'm still willing to negotiate but that I'm not willing to drop too much further. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where the negotiations are not moving forward. I'm concerned that if I reject Bob's offer again, he might not come back with a higher offer in the next round. With only two rounds left, I'm taking the guaranteed $120 from John to avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
