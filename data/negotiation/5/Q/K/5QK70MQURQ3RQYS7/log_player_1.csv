Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $130, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is to incentivize Bob to make a deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $130 offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting with a lower offer, I create an opportunity for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow me to gauge his interest and potentially increase the price.
* **John as a Backup:** I have a fallback option with John who is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer below $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? It's a good offer, and I'm ready to buy right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $80. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $150, so I have no immediate pressure to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While $60 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This still allows me to cover my costs, and hopefully, it's a fair price for you too."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $100 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still a good distance from my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise while also highlighting the value of the product.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Maintaining the Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation increases the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement without resorting to selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me closer, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Further Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price, there is still room for negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have a reliable buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer again, hopefully closer to my desired price point. My goal is to find a compromise that is acceptable for both of us, without sacrificing my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $90, which is closer to Bob's last offer and still above my minimum price. This demonstrates my flexibility without completely conceding.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $90 is a ""fair price"" that allows both of us to be happy. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and creates a sense of win-win.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is likely my final one before resorting to selling to John. I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to compromise further.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable, even though we're getting closer to a potential impasse."
