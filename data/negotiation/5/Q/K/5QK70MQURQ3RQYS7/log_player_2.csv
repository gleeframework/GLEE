Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $90, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John for $80 guarantees the best price."
