"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about $7,000? That's a fair price closer to what I had in mind.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",8000.0,Alice,5,
