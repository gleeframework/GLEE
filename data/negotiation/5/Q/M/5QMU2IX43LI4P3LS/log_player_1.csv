Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides Alice with a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay.  In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about Bob's budget and priorities could lead to an even more tailored and effective offer."
