Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"", you subtly imply that Bob would be getting a good deal even at $15,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal that to Bob. Knowing you have another buyer might make him less likely to negotiate.

**It's important to note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
