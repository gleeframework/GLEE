"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is still a good profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair profit. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a good compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can agree on this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  $887,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!",887500.0,Alice,5,
