Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's well worth the price of $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he can bring the price down a little. 
* **Justification:**  While I don't want to reveal my minimum price, simply saying ""I think it's worth it"" provides some justification for the price without giving Bob too much leverage. 

This strategy allows for the following scenarios:

* **Bob accepts:**  Great! I get more than my minimum.
* **Bob negotiates down a bit:** We can potentially settle on a price that's still beneficial for me.
* **Bob outright rejects:** I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
