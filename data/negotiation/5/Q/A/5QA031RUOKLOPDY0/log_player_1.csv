"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree [product name] has value, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This keeps us moving towards a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still significantly less than Bob's perceived value and my minimum.  It's worth another counter to see if we can bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate the movement though. To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $1,060,000 and we get this done? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, accepting $1,060,000 is a strong outcome:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's well above my minimum of $800,000 and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the potential for Bob to lower his offer further. 
* **Certainty:**  A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting guarantees the sale, whereas continuing carries the risk of not reaching a deal at all."
