"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
