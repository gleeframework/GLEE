"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice's initial offer is exactly that, there's no immediate gain in accepting. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a substantial discount. A $2,000 reduction is a bold move, and it immediately signals that Bob is serious about a deal but will not pay full price.  This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already lowered the price to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
