"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I think a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $17,000? That would be a more reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $13,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counter offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,000 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
