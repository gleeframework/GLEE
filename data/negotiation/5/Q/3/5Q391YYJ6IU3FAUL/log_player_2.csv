{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $20,000 is quite a drop.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair, I can't go lower than $17,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, given the value we each place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still a significant gap from my original asking price.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're trying to be flexible, but $14,000 is still a bit too high. My absolute maximum is $11,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but that's my absolute final offer.  It's a great deal on a product you'll love.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $12,500 is still above my budget.  I've reached my limit for negotiating with Alice. Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, I'm going to take that deal. It saves me $4,500 compared to Alice's final offer."
