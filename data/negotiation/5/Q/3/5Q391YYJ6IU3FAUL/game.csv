"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $20,000 is quite a drop.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair, I can't go lower than $17,000.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, given the value we each place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still a significant gap from my original asking price.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to be flexible, but $14,000 is still a bit too high. My absolute maximum is $11,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering your initial asking price and the value I place on the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but that's my absolute final offer.  It's a great deal on a product you'll love.",12500.0,Alice,7,
