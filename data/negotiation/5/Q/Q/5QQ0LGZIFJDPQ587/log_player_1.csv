"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.  I'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is still a good profit, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $105. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaving me with a good profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
