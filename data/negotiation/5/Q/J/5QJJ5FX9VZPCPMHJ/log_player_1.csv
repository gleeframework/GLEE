"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still higher than your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $80 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the value you want to achieve. You have 8 rounds remaining and can potentially achieve a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and keep the door open for a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $120.  The product is in excellent condition and worth more than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering the price you're looking for and the value it's worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to your desired price point.  While it's still below your initial asking price, it's a good compromise. You have 6 rounds remaining, but there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and you risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit of $25, which is a significant gain considering your minimum selling price."
