"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still a bit too high. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. That's the minimum I can sell it for. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free consultation and a warranty. How about we meet at $14,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he's already gotten Alice down to $14,000. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate, or by going with John. He still has several rounds to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  Let's close this deal. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not making any more concessions after this. It's either $14,000 or we walk away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for him, and she's made it clear that she won't budge further.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and is running out of time. At this point, it's better to secure the product for $10,000 from John rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
