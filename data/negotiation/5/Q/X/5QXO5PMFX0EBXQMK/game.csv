"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident you'll find my starting price of $1,500,000 to be fair. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it will exceed your expectations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering its potential. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 falls short of the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which represents a substantial compromise on my end.  Let's work together to bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000.  However,  that's still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
