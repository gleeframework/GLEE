"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still provides a substantial value for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your desired value. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
