"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. I'd like to propose a price of $120 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a bit more than what I think the product is worth to me, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay more. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Based on our previous discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise given its value to both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $95 as the price for the product, which is slightly higher than your last offer but still below my initial asking price. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,5,
