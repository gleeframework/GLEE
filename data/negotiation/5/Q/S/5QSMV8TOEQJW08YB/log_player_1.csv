"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This should give me a good starting point for negotiation, while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the middle ground.  This should encourage Bob to come up a bit more while keeping me within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  It's a bit risky, but with five rounds left, there's still a chance to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87} 
```

I'm making a small concession to Bob, hoping to push him towards a compromise. This offer is still above my minimum, and with fewer rounds remaining, it's crucial to start showing some flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is now at my minimum, and with only four rounds remaining, I don't have enough time to push for a better price. It's better to guarantee the $80 sale to John than risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement with Bob."
