I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it!,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be interested in buying if you were to drop the price to $85.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little higher than my budget.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I'll compromise and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $105 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm happy to go up to $98, which is a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your spirit, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $98. I'll think about it and come back with a new offer. Let me see... I'll offer it to you for $108. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny.",108.0,Alice,7,
