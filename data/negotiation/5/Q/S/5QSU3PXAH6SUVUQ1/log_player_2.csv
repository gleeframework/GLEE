"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $100 is better than John's $120, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This tests the waters and sees how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still aiming lower. It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle of our last offers, at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're proposing a price directly in between our last two offers. This keeps the negotiation moving and demonstrates willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the idea of meeting in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80. I'm still looking for a bit more profit. How about we try $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely trying to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit high. We'll counter-offer again, inching closer to her price while staying below our $120 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I'm willing to go up a little bit. How about $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

We're acknowledging Alice's negotiating skills while still pushing for a lower price. This offer keeps us in the game and shows Alice we're serious about buying, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $88? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point.  While we could try to haggle a bit more, $88 is a decent price and well below our maximum budget. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation falling apart later."
