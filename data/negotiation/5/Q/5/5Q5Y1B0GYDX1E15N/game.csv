"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. If we can agree on that, we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
