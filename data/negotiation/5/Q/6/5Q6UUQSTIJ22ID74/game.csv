"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to your budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we make it work at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still below what I can reasonably accept.  Let's split the difference: I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this now.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
