Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you know the value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the potential profit for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, as I know he won't accept my initial price. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm ready to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low, as I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob is clearly interested in the product. Rejecting his offer will allow me to counter with a price closer to my target.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I don't need to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to your budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value he'll gain by purchasing the product.
* **Leaving Room for Finality:** While $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, it still allows for potential future negotiation.  
* **Time is Money:**  The longer this negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that I'll decide to sell to John.  I'm trying to reach a compromise quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we make it work at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can push him closer to my price.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  I have John as a backup buyer, and the longer I spend negotiating with Bob, the greater the risk of losing him as a buyer.  I want to make a quick decision to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still below what I can reasonably accept.  Let's split the difference: I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm using this counteroffer as my final offer, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting.  
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm reminding Bob that time is of the essence, and if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll be forced to sell to John.
* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that a deal at $1,000,000 would be a good outcome for both of us."
