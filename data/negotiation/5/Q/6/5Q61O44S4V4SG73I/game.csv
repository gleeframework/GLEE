"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. I'm still hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,400? It's a small step for me, and I think we're very close to a deal. What do you say?",10400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $10,200 is my absolute limit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,300. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's try to find common ground here.",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $10,150 is my absolute limit. I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think this product could be a good fit for me. Can you meet me at $10,150?",10150.0,Bob,8,
