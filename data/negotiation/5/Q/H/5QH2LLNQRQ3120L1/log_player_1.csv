Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is still worth more to Bob than to John, and he has shown interest.  I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're interested in the product.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your original price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I think there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not quite ready to sell yet.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $925,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is my absolute lowest price.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to consider my final offer."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to be flexible, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional services to sweeten the deal. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm a little disappointed to not have gotten closer to my original asking price,  Bob's offer is approaching my minimum acceptable price and the added services could potentially add more value down the line. It's important to close this deal before running out of rounds and risking having to sell to John at a lower price."
