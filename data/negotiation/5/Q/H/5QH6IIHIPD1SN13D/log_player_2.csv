"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise.  It's still within Bob's budget and a better price than what John is offering.  There's not much more room for negotiation at this point, so accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
