"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,112,500?  This gives us both a good deal.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value your continued interest in the product, but $1,075,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This reflects a good balance between our needs and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
