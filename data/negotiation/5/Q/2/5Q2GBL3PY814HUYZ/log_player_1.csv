This is a tough situation.  Bob is proving to be a tough negotiator, and I'm running out of time.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. It's time to take the sure thing."
