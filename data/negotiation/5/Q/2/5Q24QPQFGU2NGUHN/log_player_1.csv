{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 would be fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John provides a safety net at $1,000,000, the goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above the fallback offer. 
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to start a dialogue, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach an even more agreeable price. 
 
This approach balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale, maximizing the chance of a successful outcome for Alice."
