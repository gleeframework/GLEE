"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to say, this is a very competitive offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit high for you, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
