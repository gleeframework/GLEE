"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to say, this is a very competitive offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of pushing her further. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your maximum price."
