"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I believe this is a good starting point for further negotiations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
