{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it's worth far more than its initial valuation.  To kick off our discussion, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. This allows for a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,600,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we bring it down to $900,000?  This offer reflects the true value I see in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value,  $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential for generating returns. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.  Let me know your thoughts."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,175,000?  I believe this is a fair offer that takes both of our positions into account. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we're still not there. We're willing to negotiate further as there's a good chance we can get a better price than John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still holding firm on the value this product brings.  To meet you closer to your proposal, I can come down to $1,325,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it offers you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your valuation, but $1,325,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's more than fair considering your initial asking price.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee we can negotiate a higher price, and we risk him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures we get the best possible outcome at this point."
