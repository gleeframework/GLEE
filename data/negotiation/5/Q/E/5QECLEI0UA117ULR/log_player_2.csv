"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it's worth far more than its initial valuation.  To kick off our discussion, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. This allows for a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,600,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. How about we bring it down to $900,000?  This offer reflects the true value I see in the product. Let me know what you think."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value,  $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential for generating returns. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still holding firm on the value this product brings.
