{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate a price he feels comfortable with.  I believe this approach will increase the likelihood of a successful sale while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I will counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."

Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is close enough to my ideal price point and significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's time to close this deal."
