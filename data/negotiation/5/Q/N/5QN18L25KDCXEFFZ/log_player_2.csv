"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $140 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for cheaper.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $135 for the product. This allows us to find a mutually beneficial solution while respecting the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is only $15 more than her own valuation of the product.  This is a fair deal for both parties, and it's better than the $150 Bob would pay from John. There's no real benefit to continuing to negotiate."
