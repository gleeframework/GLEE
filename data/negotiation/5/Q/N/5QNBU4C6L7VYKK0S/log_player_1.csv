"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the market. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still hoping to get it for closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise considering Bob's budget and the potential for further negotiation. I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000, which gives me some leverage."
