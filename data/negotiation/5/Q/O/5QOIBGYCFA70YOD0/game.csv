"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is still a significant gain for you, as it's more than you value the product at. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
