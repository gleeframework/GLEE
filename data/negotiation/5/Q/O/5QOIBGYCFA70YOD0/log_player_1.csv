Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is still a significant gain for you, as it's more than you value the product at. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

It's clear Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. Accepting his offer would mean losing a significant amount compared to selling to John.  It's time to move on."
