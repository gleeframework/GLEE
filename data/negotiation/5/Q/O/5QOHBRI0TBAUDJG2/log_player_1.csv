Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing we have a guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer must be above $8,000 for Bob to even consider it.
* **Below John's Price:** We stay below $15,000 to ensure Bob's offer is more appealing to us.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**The chosen price of $12,000 aims to strike a balance. It gives Bob a substantial discount while still securing a significant profit for Alice if he accepts.**"
