"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  The value of this product is undeniable, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm offering $1,250,000.  This price still leaves room for negotiation, and I'm eager to find a solution that benefits both our businesses.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal. Would you consider $1,125,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for your business, and I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 reflects that.  I'm willing to offer a final compromise: $1,175,000.  This price would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll agree.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
