"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $130 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $145?  It's still a good price considering the product's worth. Let's make this deal happen!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $145 is still a little high for me, though. I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  $140 is tempting, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $143?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",143.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $143 is still just a tad too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $140.  Let's close this deal!",140.0,Bob,6,
