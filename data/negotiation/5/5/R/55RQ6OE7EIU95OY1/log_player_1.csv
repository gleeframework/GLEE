"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:** This is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and mentions the product's value to Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  By starting with a price slightly higher than your minimum, you create space to potentially negotiate down if necessary while still maximizing your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is below your minimum, there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Option 3 is not ideal:** Selling to John for $80 is a safe option, but you can potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, considering your interest in the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between Bob's offer of $70 and my previous offer of $100. 
* **Message:**  The message is still friendly and acknowledges Bob's interest in the product. It also emphasizes my willingness to compromise and reach a fair deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By making a counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility and demonstrating my willingness to work with Bob to reach an agreement. This increases the likelihood of closing a deal at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  Bob has offered $80, which is your minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price, and you risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Option 3 is equal:** Selling to John for $80 would result in the same earnings. However, accepting Bob's offer allows you to potentially maintain a relationship with Bob for future transactions. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure your minimum acceptable price and ensure a successful deal."
