Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, while still allowing me to make a good profit. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and proceed from there.  I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject his offer and try for a counteroffer closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $120. John has offered me my minimum, so I'm going to accept his offer and sell to him."
