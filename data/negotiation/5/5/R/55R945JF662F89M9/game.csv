"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This offer reflects its worth while still being a good deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I want to make this work, I can't go as low as $11,500. I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. Let's settle at $12,500, my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,500, so how about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
