Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $12,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $8,000. However, it's still a ""deal"" compared to John's guaranteed purchase price. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, we subtly pressure Bob to make a decision without revealing John's guaranteed offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
