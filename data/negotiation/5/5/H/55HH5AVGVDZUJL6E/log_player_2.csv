"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm sure we can find mutually beneficial terms. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $2,000,000.
