Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Value justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly reveal your minimum price, it emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify a higher price.
* **Urgency and scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit with Bob while still securing a sale. If Bob rejects the offer, you can fall back on your guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000."
