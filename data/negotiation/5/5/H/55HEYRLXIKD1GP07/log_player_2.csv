# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know the value is $1,200,000.  If you decline, I'll be selling to another buyer for a higher price, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice is offering a good deal, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is the best price for him."
