Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues my product. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
