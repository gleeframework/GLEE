"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a little closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is the most financially sound choice."
