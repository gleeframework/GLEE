"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go up to $88.  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit above $88.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  I really think this is a great product for you and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $89.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",89.0,Bob,6,
