"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $14,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from the original price, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  To make this quick, how about $12,000 even? That's a fair price and we both win.",12000.0,Bob,6,
