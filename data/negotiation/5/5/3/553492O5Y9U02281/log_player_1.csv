We're getting very close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and Bob is clearly hesitant to meet my price. I'll hold firm one more time to see if I can push him a bit further."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  We're in the final rounds, and while I'd like to get closer to $1,400,000, Bob is unlikely to move much higher.  $1,365,000 is a significant profit, and it's better to take this offer than risk the negotiations falling apart and getting only John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
