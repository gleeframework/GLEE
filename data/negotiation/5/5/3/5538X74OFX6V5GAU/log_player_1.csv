Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and counteroffer accordingly.  I also have the safety net of John's offer, so I'm not pressured to accept anything less than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price through negotiation. I'll counteroffer, but keep in mind I'm not willing to go below $800,000 and have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.  It's also a significant increase from Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge further. While John is a safe option at $800,000, I'm still hopeful of getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer and only $50,000 away from my minimum.  It's a strong indication of my commitment to finding a deal but also a clear signal that I'm not willing to go much lower.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally met my minimum price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a higher price.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
