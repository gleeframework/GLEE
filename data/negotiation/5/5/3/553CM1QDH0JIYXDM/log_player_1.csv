{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, so this offer gives you a profit margin.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he might be willing to pay a premium.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** This lets Bob know you're serious about selling and have a clear price in mind.

It's important to remember that this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum.  While you're open to negotiating, accepting his offer would be a big loss for you.  It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate, his offer is still below your minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John ensures you receive your minimum desired price, which is a safer and more reliable option at this point."
