"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob.  I'm hoping to secure a high price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $880,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $800,000, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to hold out a little longer and see if Bob is willing to go higher.  I have 6 rounds left, so I still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $880,000 is still not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this offer, and come down to $890,000.  This is a small compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous offer, it's still a little too low for me. I have 4 rounds remaining and I'm hoping I can get him to move higher. I'm confident I can secure a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $860,000.  However, I'm still not able to go below $875,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and move forward."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a difficult choice. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I have only 2 rounds left, and it's very possible that Bob won't budge further. Accepting his offer at $850,000 is still significantly more than what John is offering. It's a gamble, but I'm willing to take it."
