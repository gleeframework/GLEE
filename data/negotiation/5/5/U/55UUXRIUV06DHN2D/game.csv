"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $880,000 is still not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this offer, and come down to $890,000.  This is a small compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
