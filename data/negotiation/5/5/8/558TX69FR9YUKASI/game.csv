"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $130 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $115? It's a fair compromise, and hopefully we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
