We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very close to my minimum price, but I'm worried that we might not reach an agreement with Bob. I've already made several concessions, and it's getting risky to continue.  Selling to John is the safest option at this point, as it guarantees me a price that's within my comfort zone."
