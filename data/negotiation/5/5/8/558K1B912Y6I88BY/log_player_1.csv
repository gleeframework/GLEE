Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price that's attractive. Here's why:

* **Knowing the Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be room for Bob to negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his perceived value.
* **Securing a Profit Above John's Offer:** Even if Bob negotiates the price down, the offer ensures you'll earn more than the $10,000 John is willing to pay.

This approach balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
