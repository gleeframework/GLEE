Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  

I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or rejects the offer and I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'll also keep in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $900,000.  While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the gap a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,000,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial offer of $900,000. It's also a significant step closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000, which might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $950,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's also close enough to my initial offer of $1,200,000 that I'm comfortable with the deal.  I think further negotiation might take too long and could potentially lead to a lower price."
