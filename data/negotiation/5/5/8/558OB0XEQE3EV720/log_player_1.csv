Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500, which reflects its worth and the value it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so the offer needs to be worthwhile.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach balances ambition with realism. It positions the product's value to Bob while acknowledging his potential desire for a deal. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still likely to get a price significantly higher than your $8,000 backup offer."
