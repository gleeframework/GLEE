"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can do better with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a significant step closer to what I need. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I'm looking for,  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,250,000 still leaves me quite a bit short.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's close this deal and get you this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I believe I can still push for a bit more. We're now at a point where I might consider selling to John, but I'm going to try one more time to reach a better agreement with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 still isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's a great deal for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $1,300,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's getting very close with Bob, but I've already made a significant number of concessions, and there's a good chance we won't be able to reach an agreement.  I've run out of time to keep negotiating, and John's offer provides me with my minimum."
