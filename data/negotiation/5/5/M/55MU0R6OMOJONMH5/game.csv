"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential value it holds.  I believe this is a win-win for both of us, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase if this price is acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for the product, but $975,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a good enough price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000 again, which would be $1,000,000. I believe this is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
