"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16500 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $16000. This is a very good price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
