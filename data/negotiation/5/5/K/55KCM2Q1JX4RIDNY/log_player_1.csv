Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential for higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice can afford to be a bit bolder in her initial offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly justifies the higher price without revealing her true minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price during further negotiation."
