"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be highly valuable to your company. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price, so let's start the conversation!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good price considering the potential value for your company.  Let's find a middle ground, how about we split the difference at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $900,000, so I'm thinking of $950,000. Can you consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still need to make a decent profit on this deal.  To meet in the middle, I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This reflects the value we've both acknowledged and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a decent profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
