Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still need to make a decent profit on this deal.
