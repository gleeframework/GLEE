"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting at this price because I think it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

It's not worth going back and forth with Alice any longer. She's unlikely to go below $12,500, and you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Time to take the guaranteed saving."
