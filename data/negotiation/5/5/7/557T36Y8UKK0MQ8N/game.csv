"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $16,000 for it.  What do you say?",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
