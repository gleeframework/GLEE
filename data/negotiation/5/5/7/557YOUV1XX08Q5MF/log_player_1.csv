"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so accepting his offer would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob is at his maximum, I still have room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum.
* **John is a backup option:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 provides leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not going below my minimum acceptable range.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob even at the new price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion, making it seem like I'm willing to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept this counteroffer.  However, if he rejects it again, I'll likely need to make a decision about selling to John to avoid losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my target price, $13,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We've made progress, and Bob seems willing to negotiate.  I can likely get a better deal with one more counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a buyer gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without rushing into a sub-optimal deal.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming to secure a price of $14,000.  This will be my final offer before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This price still gives you a fantastic deal, and it's the closest I can come to meet your needs.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob before considering John's offer. 
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum while still showing willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the potential for closing the deal and making it happen.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll be ready to accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed profit."
