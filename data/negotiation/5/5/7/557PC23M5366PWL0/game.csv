"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties in the past who have been willing to pay more for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value it brings. Let's try $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, which is $1000000. I know it's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe the product's value justifies it. Let's see if we can make it work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
