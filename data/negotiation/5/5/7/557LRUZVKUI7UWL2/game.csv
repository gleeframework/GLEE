"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,800.  I'm willing to go to $10,250, which is very close to my budget and a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,5,
