"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $975,000. This offer reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $975,000 is still a bit out of reach.  I can make this work for $725,000. Let me know if that's agreeable.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the price gap is still substantial.  My final offer is $860,000.  This offer balances my need for a fair return on the product's value with your desire to acquire it.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",860000.0,Alice,5,
