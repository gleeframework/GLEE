,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $1,250,000 is slightly out of my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
