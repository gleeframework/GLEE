"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $80 to $100. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $125 offer. I believe I can find similar products within my budget range elsewhere. However, I would like to express my gratitude for considering my financial situation. Best regards, Bob.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a product within your budget range, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but still a good compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts in trying to accommodate my budget. However, I am unable to accept $115 for the product. I am hoping to keep the price closer to my initial proposal of $95. I am open to discussing further if you are willing to meet me at this price point.",95.0,Bob,6,
