"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and what I know the product is worth to him. I'm willing to negotiate, but accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I'll counter in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I've significantly decreased my asking price to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm well above my minimum. This counter-offer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but also keeps us in a price range that is profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $725,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $725,000 is still below my guaranteed sale price with John. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to push him a bit closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $775,000?  This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've reduced my offer again to show Bob I'm flexible and open to closing the deal.  However, I'm maintaining a price above my guaranteed sale to John, as I still believe Bob might be willing to go higher.  This price point also keeps the negotiation moving forward without sacrificing too much potential profit."
