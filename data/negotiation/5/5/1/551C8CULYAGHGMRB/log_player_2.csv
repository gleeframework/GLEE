"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  While $100 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's counteroffer:** $95 is only $5 more than Bob's $90 offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation is progressing, and Bob is getting closer to his desired price. 
* **Risk of going to John:**  While John is an option, buying from him is the most expensive choice.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a price within his budget and avoids the risk of a potential stalemate or having to pay John's higher price."
