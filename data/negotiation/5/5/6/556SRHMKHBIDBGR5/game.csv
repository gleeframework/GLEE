"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $150 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price.",150.0,Bob,4,
