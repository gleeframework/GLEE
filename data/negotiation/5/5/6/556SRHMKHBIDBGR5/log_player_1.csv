"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $140 is too low, but I'll see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $150 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already established that I'm willing to sell to John for that amount.  Since this is a final offer from Bob and we've already reached my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John. This ensures I get my desired amount and saves time in the negotiation process."
