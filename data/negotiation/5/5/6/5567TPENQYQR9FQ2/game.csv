"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise given the value I see in it.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
