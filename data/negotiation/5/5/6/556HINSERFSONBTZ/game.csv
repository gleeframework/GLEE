"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
