Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. I am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's still a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is being stubborn, but I'm not going to give up just yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer. If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for us both.  I can't go any lower than $105.  This is a fantastic product and you'll get a lot of value from it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I still believe $100 is the fair price for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've made my best offer to Bob, and he's not budging.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $105, and it seems like he's not willing to go any higher.  Rather than continue this stalemate, I'll sell the product to John for $120. It's the best outcome for me at this point."
