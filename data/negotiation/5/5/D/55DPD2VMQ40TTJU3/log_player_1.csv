"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the best possible profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my target. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a fair price. I believe this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept while still providing me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer. While I prefer to get closer to my initial price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and accepting his offer ensures a decent profit. There's a risk that he might further lower his offer in the next round, or I might have to sell to John for a lower price.  I'm choosing to secure the deal now."
