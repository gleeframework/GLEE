"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, potentially even exceeding $800000.  I understand its value might be different to you, but I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This price reflects its potential and allows for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for me at $1,000,000, and I can get it from John for $1,500,000. I'd like to see if I can find a better deal.
