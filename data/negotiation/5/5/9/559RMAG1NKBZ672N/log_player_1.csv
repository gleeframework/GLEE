Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however,  $18,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John at $10,000 if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, Bob's final offer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise and still nets a profit above John's offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
