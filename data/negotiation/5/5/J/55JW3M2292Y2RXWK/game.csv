"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal for $90, which is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still a fair price for this high-quality product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $75 yet. I can do $85, which is still a good compromise, but closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet there.",85.0,Alice,5,
