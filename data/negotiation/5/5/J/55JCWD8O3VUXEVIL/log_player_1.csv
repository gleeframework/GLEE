I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good deal without having to go through multiple rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price, given that Bob's counteroffer was way too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I believe I can get a better deal with a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $15,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but still a good price for me. I believe this is the best price I can get from Bob, considering his last offer. If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
