You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can likely get a better deal than $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,250?  This would give you a good deal and still allow me to get a decent price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

You're still closer to your target price of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit lower before resorting to buying from John."
