Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows good faith:** You're not trying to squeeze every dollar out of him. 

If Bob rejects, you can use his counteroffer to guide your next move. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if you feel the negotiation is going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum of $10,000, it's worth trying to push for a higher price. You can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to your initial offer of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $10,000 and close enough to your last counteroffer to make it worthwhile.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and allows you to avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
