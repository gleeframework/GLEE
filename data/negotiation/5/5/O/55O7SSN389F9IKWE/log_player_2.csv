# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.
