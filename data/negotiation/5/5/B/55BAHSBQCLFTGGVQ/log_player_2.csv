"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its high quality and unique features, it's perfect for someone like you who appreciates exceptional value. Considering its worth to you is $100, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $120. This price not only reflects the product's true value but also allows me to maintain a fair profit. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
