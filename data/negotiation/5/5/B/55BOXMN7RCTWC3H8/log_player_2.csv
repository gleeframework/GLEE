"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $13,500. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $13,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While there's always a chance to get a lower price, the likelihood of Alice going lower than $13,000 is uncertain.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets a good deal while minimizing risk."
