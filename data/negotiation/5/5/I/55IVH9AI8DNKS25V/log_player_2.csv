It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a lot of room to go down from $120 to reach your target price of $150 or less."

Alice is still higher than my target price, but I'm not yet at the point where it's better to just buy from John. I'll keep trying to negotiate a lower price."

While $140 is close to my target price, I have a few rounds left, so I can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth taking a chance to see if I can get it for less."

At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. Alice is refusing to go lower than $145, and I only have one round left. Buying from John for $150 is a better deal than accepting Alice's offer."
