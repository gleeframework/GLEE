{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's slightly below my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for potential counteroffers. It also emphasizes the value of the product to me, hinting at a higher potential value for Bob. This approach aims to encourage Bob to counter while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about paying $9,000. How about we meet in the middle of $9,000 and $8,500? I'd be willing to pay $8,750 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $10,000. I believe I can potentially get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,750.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a significant compromise, and it's the final offer I can make."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has clearly reached his limit and is now threatening to buy from John.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential for a better price is slim.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed deal with John."
