Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500,  let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Since Bob values the product at $8,000, there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives you leverage. You don't need to go below that price. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale above Bob's perceived value while staying below your guaranteed price from John."
