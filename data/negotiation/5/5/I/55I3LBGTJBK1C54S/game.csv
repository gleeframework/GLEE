"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity,  $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, to be candid, $1,200,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm confident that this product can generate substantial returns exceeding your initial assessment. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This price reflects the true potential of what we're discussing.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your belief in the product's potential, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
