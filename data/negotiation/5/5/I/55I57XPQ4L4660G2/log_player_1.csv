Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $110 is a reasonable compromise. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures a profit."
