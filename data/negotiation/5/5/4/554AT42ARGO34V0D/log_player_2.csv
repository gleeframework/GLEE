"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a very inflated starting price.  It's nowhere near my budget, and significantly higher than John's offer. A counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it."", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it establishes a baseline within my budget. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This leaves ample room for negotiation if Alice is willing to come down considerably. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We have limited rounds, so getting closer to a reasonable price quickly is essential."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $130 is better than $200, it's still significantly above my budget of $80 and John's offer. 
* **Alice is Negotiable:** Alice reducing her price indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's room to push further. 
* **Time Factor:** We're approaching the halfway point in the rounds, making it important to steer the price closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate that.  $130 is still a bit of a stretch for me though. Could you do $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  Since time is a factor, I'm going straight to my target price.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This will show Alice my firm limit. It lets her decide if she's willing to sell at that price or if we need to find a compromise.
* **John's Offer:** Having John's offer in my back pocket gives me leverage. If Alice refuses, I can walk away without losing the opportunity."
