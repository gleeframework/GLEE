"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $13500.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13500 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about $14250?  It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.  Let's try to come to an agreement this round.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $14250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13875?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal this round.",13875.0,Bob,6,
