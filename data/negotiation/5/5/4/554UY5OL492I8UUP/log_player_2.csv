Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to meet my minimum. How about we meet at $14,500? This is as low as I can go.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,500 is still above his budget. He should try to get a lower price or consider buying from John.  It's starting to get risky, so this counteroffer should be his final attempt to get a better deal from Alice."
