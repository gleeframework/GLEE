"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's value and potential. I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions or suggestions."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still within the realm of potential negotiation.  I believe I can improve on that offer by counter-offering. I'm not ready to settle for $1,100,000 and will try to push for a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would mean leaving $200,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer a price of $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for some flexibility.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a higher price.  Selling to John right now would mean losing $50,000, and I'm confident I can secure a better price.  I'm not going to accept any offers below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not going to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,150,000 still falls short of what the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, my absolute minimum. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.  I believe this is a final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet your minimum price. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer, but it's still below my minimum.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's only a limited number of rounds left.  I'm confident that I can secure the full $1,200,000 from John, so it's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure deal.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price in the final rounds."
