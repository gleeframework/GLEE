"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe it's worth more than what others might offer, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $90 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value you see in it. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let me know if that works for you.",87.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're closing in on a price that suits both of us. I would like to propose $88 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. Please let me know if this works for you.",88.0,Alice,5,
