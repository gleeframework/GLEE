"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe it's worth more than what others might offer, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good deal, but you can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that's acceptable."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $90 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value you see in it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a good deal for you, but you can likely squeeze out a bit more.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're closing in on a price that suits both of us. I would like to propose $88 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $88, which is very close to your counteroffer of $87.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  It's a good deal for you, and you're saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice here."
