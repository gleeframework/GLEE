Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my $10,000 minimum. Accepting his current offer means losing potential profit. It's more strategic to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
