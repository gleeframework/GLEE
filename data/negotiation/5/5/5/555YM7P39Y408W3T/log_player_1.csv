"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While the product is very valuable, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. While $1,700,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still push for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  Let's settle at $1,825,000. This reflects the product's value while recognizing your willingness to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm coming down in smaller increments now to signal I'm nearing my bottom line. Offering a  $1,825,000 keeps the price above Bob's last offer while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly dropped his increment, indicating he's reaching his maximum. I need to hold firm to signal I won't go below a certain threshold, which is still above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. $1,750,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm drawing a firm line with this offer. It's a significant profit margin above my alternative (John) and signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to go lower. By stating it's my final offer, I add weight and urgency for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's now below my safety net ($1,650,000), and continuing the negotiation has a higher risk than reward. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable profit and avoids further time investment with Bob."
