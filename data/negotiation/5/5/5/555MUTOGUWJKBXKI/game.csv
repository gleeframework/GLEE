"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $15,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  I'm hoping to reach a final agreement soon.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that's the best we can do, and I'd hate to lose out on a sale. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, which is a good compromise for both of us. It's getting late, and I want to make a decision soon. Let me know what you think.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to finalize the sale soon. Let's see if we can shake on it!",13250.0,Alice,7,
