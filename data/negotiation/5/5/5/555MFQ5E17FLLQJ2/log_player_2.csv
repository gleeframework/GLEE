Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $11,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my desired price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate. $10,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to make a profit on this. How about $10,900? This would be a great deal for both of us.  Think about it - you still get the product for significantly less than its value to you.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiations.  However,  $10,550 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once again.  How about $10,750?

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. But I also need to make a reasonable profit.  I'm sticking to my last offer of $10,750.
