"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13000? This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. ",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $13000 is a bit too high. How about $11500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11500 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $12500.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit short. How about $12200? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me.",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12200 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $12400? This way, we both get a fair price, and you can secure the product you've been wanting. What do you say?",12400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12400 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,8,
