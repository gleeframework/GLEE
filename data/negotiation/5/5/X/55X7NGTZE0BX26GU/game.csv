"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm open to considering a price closer to $1,150,000.  This would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,125,000? This price is still fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
