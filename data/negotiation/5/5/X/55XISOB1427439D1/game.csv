"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, as I value our potential partnership. This is a fair compromise, considering my original offer and your budget. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and your previous offer. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
