"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to the product's full value, it's still over Bob's budget.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and Bob should aim for something closer to his target of $800,000."
