"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, there's definitely room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.** You can try to lower the price and save money.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  It's good to have that option, but it's not the best deal right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a significant counteroffer:**  This shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and are willing to pay a fair price. 
* **Targeting the midpoint:**  By offering $850,000, you're splitting the difference between Alice's desired price ($800,000) and your initial offer ($950,000). This can encourage a quicker agreement. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** There's still room to go up if Alice rejects this offer, but it's a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above the midpoint we were aiming for. 
* **Continuing negotiation is still worthwhile.**  There's still room to potentially lower the price further.
* **Buying from John is still a backup.** It's good to have that option, but not the best deal right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the offer slightly:** Since Alice is unwilling to go lower than $900,000, we need to adjust our counteroffer. 
* **Staying close to the midpoint:**  $875,000 is still closer to the midpoint ($850,000) than Alice's offer, signaling that we're still seeking a fair price.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This offer still leaves room for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to our desired price.**  While it's higher than our last counteroffer, it's within a reasonable range and getting closer to our target.
* **Further negotiation may be time-consuming.**  We've already gone through a few rounds, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. 
* **Buying from John is still a backup.** We have that option if we can't reach an agreement with Alice.

**At this point, it's a risk-reward calculation. We could try to negotiate further, but we risk Alice walking away or reaching an impasse. Accepting her offer secures the product at a price that's still within our budget and saves us time and potential frustration.**"
