"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. Since you can get the product from John for your budget, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
