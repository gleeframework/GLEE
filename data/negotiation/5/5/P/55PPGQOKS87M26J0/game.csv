"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is way above my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for this product. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $11,000.  This is a much fairer offer considering its worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept $9,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end.",9000.0,Alice,5,
