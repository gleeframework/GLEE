"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so rejecting it and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal you're offering,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range that shows you're serious about buying the product. By starting at a lower price, you're putting pressure on Alice to compromise.  You also include a message to make the interaction feel more personable and open up the potential for further negotiation."
