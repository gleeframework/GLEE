{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to save more. 
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.** This gives Bob a chance to push for a lower price. 
* **It's too early to buy from John.**  Bob should see if he can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Focus on the middle ground:**  Bob aims to find a price that is more beneficial to him while acknowledging that Alice likely won't accept a price close to her value. 
* **Set the stage for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer creates a starting point for bargaining in subsequent rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price:**  While it's a decrease from her initial offer, it's still above what Bob wants to pay.
* **More room for negotiation:**  Bob can likely get the price lower with another counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is still not ideal:**  Bob should keep trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."

Round 4

{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  
* **Increased price:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his interest in closing the deal.
* **Strategic approach:**  By gradually raising his offer, Bob is making Alice feel like he is serious about buying the product while also keeping the price within his budget.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  The increased offer puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she may fear losing the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to counteroffer could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away. 
* **Reasonable price:** While not ideal, $1,125,000 is still a good deal for Bob, especially considering his alternative is $1,500,000.
* **Time constraint:** With only five rounds remaining, it's important to secure the deal before time runs out."
