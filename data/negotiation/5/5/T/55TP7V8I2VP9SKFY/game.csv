"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers and I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can meet you in the middle at $11500. Would you be willing to consider that?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit high at $11500. How about we split the difference and go with $10750? This feels like a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10750. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $11250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  Let's meet in the middle at $11000.  I think this would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we do $11250, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to offer extras, but I'm still stuck at $11000. That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I've been flexible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm starting to think I might have to consider other options. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $11500. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",11500.0,Alice,9,
