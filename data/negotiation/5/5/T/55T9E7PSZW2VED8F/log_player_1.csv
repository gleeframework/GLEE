Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount to you, potentially even more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Consider this offer: [your product price].  If you're interested, we can discuss further details.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I've kept the message concise and focused on the value proposition for Bob. I've also emphasized the ""fairness"" of the price, which might make him more receptive.
* **Product Price:**  I'm offering a price of $1,200,000. This is higher than John's offer, but it's also below the maximum value Bob would be willing to pay.  

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential Gain:** By offering a price higher than John's, I'm increasing my chances of getting a better deal. 
* **Appeal to Bob's Value:**  The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not the absolute maximum, leaving room for negotiation if Bob expresses interest.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. You could adjust the price and message based on factors like:

* **Your relationship with Bob:** If you have a strong relationship, you might be more direct in your offer.
* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a higher price. 
* **Your urgency:** If you need to sell the product quickly, you might be more willing to accept a lower price."
