"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I have to say that $900000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950000 is the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price for this product. I've done some further research and I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000, but I'm also willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is $50000 below my initial offer. This is a generous offer, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price.

"Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I've made a significant concession by offering to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which will provide you with additional value and peace of mind. I believe this is a fair deal, considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, as previously offered.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products, and I'm willing to compromise on the price to get the deal done. I'm willing to forgo the extras you're offering if it means we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",975000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
