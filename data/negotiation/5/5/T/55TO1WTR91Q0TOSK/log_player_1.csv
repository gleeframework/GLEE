I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the value I place on the product. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely and will adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to work with him while still trying to get a fair price for my product."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, $12,500 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum and significantly better than selling to John. 

I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
