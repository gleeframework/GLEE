"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than his maximum price of $120, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good price while keeping negotiations open. Offering $95 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about a deal. It's also above Alice's $80 value, suggesting room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial offer, and $102 is still within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that might lead to a worse deal or running out of rounds."
