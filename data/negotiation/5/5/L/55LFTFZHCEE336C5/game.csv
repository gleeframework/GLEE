,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $125? That's still a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $90.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to go down to $110, which is a good price for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $105.",105.0,Bob,6,
