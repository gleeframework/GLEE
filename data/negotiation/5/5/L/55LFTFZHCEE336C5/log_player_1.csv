{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Higher than Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:** This ensures you are still making a profit.
* **Reasonable:**  This price shows you are willing to negotiate. 

It's important to be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower the price if Bob counter-offers, but also to be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a price you're comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low for me. It is well below my minimum price, and I am confident I can get a better price from him or from John. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $125? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still making a profit.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Fair:** This price is still a good deal for Bob given the value of the product to him.

I'm confident this offer is a good compromise and will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $90 is still too low for me.  I believe I can get a better deal with Bob or John. I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to go down to $110, which is a good price for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** Shows I'm still seeking a better price but am flexible.
* **Lower than my previous offer:** Demonstrates willingness to compromise.
* **Fair:** $110 is a good price for Bob considering the product's value to him. 

I believe this offer is fair and will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price,  $105 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $150, so I'll go ahead and sell it to him."
