Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go down to $10,000. While her final offer of $11,500 isn't unreasonable, it's still more than you need to spend. You have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000.  It makes more sense to take the sure deal and avoid further negotiation."
