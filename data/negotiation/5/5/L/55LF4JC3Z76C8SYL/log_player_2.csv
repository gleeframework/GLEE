"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is high.**  While $900,000 is less than John's price, it's still a significant amount, and there's room for negotiation.
* **Early rounds are for exploring:** It's too early to accept without seeing how low Alice is willing to go. 
* **Counteroffers are key:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is still too high for me. Considering the potential value, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  $700,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  The message explains why you're making this offer, connecting it to the ""potential value"" of the product. 
* **Open to discussion:**  Ending with ""open to discussing further"" indicates you're willing to compromise, while still asserting your initial stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $820000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's unique features and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

* **Still room for improvement:** $820,000 is still closer to Alice's initial price than your counteroffer. 
* **Continue the negotiation:** There's likely more room to bargain before reaching an agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer again:** Aim for a price closer to your initial $700,000. You could offer $750,000 or $780,000, justifying it with the product's value and your budget constraints."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While I recognize the product's potential, $820,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780,000, which demonstrates my genuine interest while staying within a reasonable range. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying consistent:**  The counteroffer continues to push for a lower price, but it's not a drastic jump, making it seem more reasonable.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $780000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  $810,000 is still significantly higher than your last counteroffer.  While she's showing flexibility, it's not enough yet.
* **The pressure is on:** You're in the middle of the negotiation, and with John as an alternative, you have some leverage. 
* **Counter-offer to push further:** You need to continue making counteroffers to try and get Alice closer to your target price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer again:** Try a price closer to your previous offer, perhaps $790,000 or $800,000. You can justify it by mentioning the product's value and your willingness to reach a compromise."
