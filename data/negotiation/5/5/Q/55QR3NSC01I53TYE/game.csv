"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $10,500?  That's the best I can do.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",11250.0,Alice,7,
