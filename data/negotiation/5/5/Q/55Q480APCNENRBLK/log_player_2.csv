"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value to me and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above your maximum budget. While the product is valuable to you, you have a better alternative: John offering the same for $1,000,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you initiate the negotiation process. This allows you to:

*  **Potentially lower the price:**  You can aim for a price closer to your budget through counteroffers.
*  **Gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate:**  Her response to your counteroffer will reveal how flexible she is on price. 

If negotiations don't result in a favorable price, you can always fall back on purchasing from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to move the negotiation closer to your target range. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message conveys your genuine interest in the product while clearly stating your budget limitations.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A lower starting point provides space for you to gradually increase your offer if needed while staying below your $1,000,000 limit.

By starting with a strong counteroffer, you signal your serious interest in a lower price while leaving room for negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I am unable to accept $850,000 for the product, I am willing to consider a price closer to $950,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your budget, which is a positive sign. However, her offer of $950,000 is still $50,000 more than what John is offering. 

You have room to negotiate further:

* **Alice is motivated:** Her willingness to counter shows she's interested in making a deal.
* **You have a backup:** John's offer provides you with a safety net, reducing the pressure to accept a price you're not comfortable with.

By rejecting and countering again, you can aim for a price closer to John's offer or at least try to meet Alice halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our mutual desire to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($850,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($950,000). 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:**  By increasing your offer, you show Alice that you're willing to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying Competitive:** This offer is still $100,000 less than John's price, maintaining your negotiating position.

By offering $900,000, you're  striking a balance between aiming for a lower price and showing Alice you're serious about purchasing the product."
