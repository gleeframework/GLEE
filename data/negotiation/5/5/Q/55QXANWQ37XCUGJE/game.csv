"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
