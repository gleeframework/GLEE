Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing you to potentially earn even more. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), so he's unlikely to accept immediately. This gives you the opportunity to negotiate down slightly if needed, while still staying above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a single round of negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you will automatically sell to John for $150 as per the rules."
