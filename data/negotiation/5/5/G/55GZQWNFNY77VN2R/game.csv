"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $950,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. Let's see if we can shake on it.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're both getting close to a deal we're happy with. Let's split the difference and agree on $950,000.  This would save you some time and effort and allow us to get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $980,000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to go up to $960,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that I believe is beneficial for both of us. Let's see if we can finally finalize this deal.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go up to $960,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $980,000, but I'm not budging from there. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,9,
