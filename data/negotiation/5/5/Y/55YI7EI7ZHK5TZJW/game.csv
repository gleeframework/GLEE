"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $122.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $118 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $119?  That's a fair price for both of us.",119.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable paying $119. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer?,115.0,Bob,6,
