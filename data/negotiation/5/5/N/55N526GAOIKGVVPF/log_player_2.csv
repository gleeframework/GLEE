"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,500 is still above his maximum price of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the value in this product, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to his ideal price but still leaves room for negotiation.  He's aiming to be aggressive but not too aggressive,  giving Alice a reason to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $12,000 from John, so there's still room to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's worth continuing the negotiation process and trying to get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000. How about we split the difference at $10,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price but staying within a realistic range. This counteroffer is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product but wants to get a good deal. By proposing a split of the difference, he's demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase and appreciate you working with me.  While $10,750 is close, I can't go that low. My final offer is $10,900.  This is a great deal for a product you'll get immense value from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and gets him a good deal. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, or that he'll run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it secures the product at a reasonable price."
