"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and presenting it as a good deal.
* **Open-ended question:** This encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I'm showing that I heard his concerns and am willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer closer to my target:** I'm offering $130, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both of us.
* **Encouraging a response:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $115 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **More negotiation room:**  I have four rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  Even though his offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm showing that I've considered his counteroffer and am trying to meet him in the middle. 
* **Counteroffer slightly above my minimum:** I'm offering $117.50, which is still above my minimum of $120, but significantly closer to Bob's offer.
* **Framing as a compromise:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is a ""fair compromise,"" making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Encouraging acceptance:** I'm using language like ""allows us to both come to an agreement"" to make it clear that I'm ready to close the deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $117.50 is still above my budget.  Let's try $110. It's a fair price, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited time:**  We're down to four rounds. There's a risk that we won't reach an agreement. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed $120, which is my minimum. Selling to John ensures I won't lose money.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation is getting lengthy, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price from Bob.

I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid further negotiations and secure my minimum profit."
