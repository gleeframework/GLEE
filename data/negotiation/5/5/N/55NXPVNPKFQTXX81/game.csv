"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $117.50 is still above my budget.  Let's try $110. It's a fair price, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
