"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a significant discount from my original price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $110? I think this price is fair and allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
