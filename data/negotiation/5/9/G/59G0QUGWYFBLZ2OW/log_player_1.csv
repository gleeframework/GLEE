Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. Would you consider $10,500?  This price is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than what it's worth to you. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,250. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and still a good deal for me.  It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
