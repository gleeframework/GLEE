{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is.  I'm hoping to find a good balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I think I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to counteroffer with a price closer to $19,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's reaction and see if we can reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $18,500 is very close to my desired price. I've already gone back and forth with him, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly higher price. It's time to accept the offer and move on."
