{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This initial offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. At the same time, it's lower than the product's worth to Bob, making it attractive to him. This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $900,000?  This would still allow you to get a great deal on a product worth a lot to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000? I think this is a fair price for a product that's worth $800,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than what I could get from John. It's a good compromise that ensures I don't lose out on a potential profit and secures a sale."
