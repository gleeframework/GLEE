"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $10,000.  This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest in the product. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and gauge his true value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $9,000, $8,500 is a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation to go south. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $8,000."
