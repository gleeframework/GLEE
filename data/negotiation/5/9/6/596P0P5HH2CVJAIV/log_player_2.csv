{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
* **Strategy:**  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's no harm in trying to get a better deal, especially since I have 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for potential counteroffers from Alice. 
* **Risk assessment:**  I'm not pushing too hard in this round. I'm willing to lose a few rounds if it means getting a better price in the long run."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Still aiming to save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000 is a better price than her initial offer, but I'm still looking for a better deal.
* **Strategy:**  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice. She's showing willingness to compromise, and I believe there's still room for a lower price. I have enough rounds left to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's compromise:** Alice lowered her offer, showing she wants to make a deal.
* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Maintaining pressure:** I'm still holding firm on my desire for a lower price, but not pushing too hard to avoid a stalemate."
