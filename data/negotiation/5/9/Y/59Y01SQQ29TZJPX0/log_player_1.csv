Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to $200.  
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this high initial offer will give me insight into his level of interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects it, I know I need to come down significantly. If he counters, I can better gauge his price range.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is exactly his perceived value, and well below my minimum. While I could accept his offer and make some profit, there's potential for a better outcome. Rejecting his offer opens up the negotiation and allows me to:

1. **Signal My Value:** By rejecting his initial offer, I communicate that I value the product higher than his first bid. 
2. **Seek a Compromise:** I can now counter with a price lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's, aiming for a price point we both find acceptable. 

I'm willing to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is higher than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly lowered my price from $200 to $170, signaling flexibility but also demonstrating that I'm seeking a fair deal. 
* **Above My Minimum:** This counteroffer is still a significant amount above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move from his initial offer. His response will determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to sell the product at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $140. While this is still below my ideal price, it's now above my absolute minimum of $150.  Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Profitable:**  A $140 sale still nets me a profit, whereas further negotiation risks him lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures the sale.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While John offers $150, the difference of $10 is likely outweighed by the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely if I push further.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out entirely for a slightly higher price."
