"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, designed to test Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation at a favorable point for me.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale quickly, I believe I can still get a better price.  $750,000 is below my minimum value of $800,000, and I have 8 more rounds to try and negotiate a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum value of $800,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rounds leading to a lower price or no deal at all outweighs the potential of getting a slightly higher price. I'm happy to secure this sale and move on."
