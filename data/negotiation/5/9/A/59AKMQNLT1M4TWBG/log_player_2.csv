"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. It's a real steal, and I believe it's worth much more than that to the right person. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  You can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiation fails."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me.  While I'm definitely interested, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

You're still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice. It's only $750 more than your counteroffer, and it's still below your maximum budget of $12,000. You can always buy from John as a last resort."
