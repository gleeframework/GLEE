"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my expectations for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
