"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product.  How about $11000?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
