Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention why the product is worth $20,000, it implies value by using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment."" This approach aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing my hand entirely.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000 gives me leverage. I can afford to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob."
