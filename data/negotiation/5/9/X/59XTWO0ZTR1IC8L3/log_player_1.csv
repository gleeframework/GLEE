Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,200,000 for it. I would like to make a counteroffer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but my budget remains firm at $1,200,000. I am unable to increase my offer. However, I would like to reiterate my interest in purchasing the product. Would you consider meeting me at this price?

Bob is holding firm at his valuation, which is significantly below mine. However, I still have room to negotiate and time before I have to decide on John's offer. I'll try to counter closer to his price to see if he's willing to budge at all."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I really appreciate the reduction, but I must stick to my budget of $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's clear Bob won't budge from $1,200,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option now to maximize profit and avoid further time investment with Bob."
