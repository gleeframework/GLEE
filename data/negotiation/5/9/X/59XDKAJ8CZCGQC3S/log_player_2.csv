"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm confident that you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000. Since John is willing to sell for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer, even if it's the same price."
