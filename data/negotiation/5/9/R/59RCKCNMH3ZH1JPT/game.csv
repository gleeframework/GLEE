"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $950,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is below the value I place on this product. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
