Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $950,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
