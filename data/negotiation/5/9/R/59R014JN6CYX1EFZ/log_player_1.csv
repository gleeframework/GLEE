Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you (as opposed to missing out and potentially having to find something similar elsewhere). You, in turn, maximize your profit compared to selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, the message leaves some subtle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
