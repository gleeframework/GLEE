{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate.  Even if the negotiations fail, you can still purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is still within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $900,000, while still leaving room for potential negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point that demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while also acknowledging the value of the product to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is actually worse than her previous offer, which is a negative sign.  There's a chance she might come down further in price if you continue to negotiate. You can still get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering. Additionally, you can always fall back on John's offer for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased, which might indicate she's less willing to negotiate. However, it's still above your target price.  This counteroffer represents a slight increase from your previous offer but remains within your budget. It's a compromise that demonstrates your willingness to meet halfway, but it's not a significant jump in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing, indicating she's unwilling to budge significantly on her price. At this point, you're closer to John's offer of $1,000,000 than any of Alice's counteroffers.  It's not worth continuing negotiations with Alice, as there's no guarantee you'll achieve a lower price.  Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you further negotiation time."
