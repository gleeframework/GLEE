"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,150,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as an alternative gives you leverage.  
* **First round is for information:** It's good to see Alice's initial stance before making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the potential value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which still reflects a strong profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While she's come down, $1,100,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There's still room to bargain. 
* **John is the backup:** I'm not in a rush. I have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. Let's settle this right now. How about $1,075,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting close:** Her offer is now only $25,000 above my last counteroffer.
* **Final offer:** She's explicitly stated this is her final offer. There's a risk of losing the deal if I reject it.
* **John's price is higher:**  While John offers the product for $1,200,000, buying from Alice saves me $125,000.

This is a good compromise that gets me the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
