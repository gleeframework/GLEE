"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $600000 simply wouldn't cover the value I've put into this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll see the value in acquiring it for your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
