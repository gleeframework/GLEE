Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, the value of this product significantly exceeds that price point. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This is a very competitive offer, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, we are still significantly above John's fallback offer. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can secure a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects my desire to make this deal happen while acknowledging the value this product brings."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer in smaller increments, suggesting he's nearing his maximum price.  While we could push for a bit more, accepting $1,850,000 secures a significant profit over John's guaranteed offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.  It's better to take a strong offer now than risk getting a lower offer later or losing the deal altogether."
