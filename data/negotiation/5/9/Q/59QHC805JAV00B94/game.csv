"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $740000, but I'm not willing to budge any further. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. However, I'm also considering selling the product to another buyer who is willing to pay the full market value. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $750000, and if you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider other options.",750000.0,Alice,9,
