"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said,  $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $1,350,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  While I want to find a deal that works for us both, I can't go as low as $1,350,000.  My final offer is $1,650,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value.  Let me know your decision.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
