"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still within a reasonable negotiation range. It leaves room for further negotiation while expressing strong interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. Could you consider $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $950,000 is still a long way from your ideal price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise. It's still significantly below Alice's last offer but acknowledges her willingness to negotiate by moving closer to her price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. However, $750,000 is still considerably below its true value.  How about we settle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $875,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the difference is now small enough that buying from John for $800,000 makes more financial sense."
