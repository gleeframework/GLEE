Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still allow you to realize a significant return on your investment, and it's a price I can work with.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  Consider the long-term value this product can bring to your business, and let's see if we can reach an agreement.
