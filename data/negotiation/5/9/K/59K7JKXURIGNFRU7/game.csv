"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still allow you to realize a significant return on your investment, and it's a price I can work with.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  Consider the long-term value this product can bring to your business, and let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
