"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $12,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product for me. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. However, $16,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident I can get a good deal from John, but I'd rather buy from you if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair offer that's still below my maximum, and it gives you a good profit margin.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
