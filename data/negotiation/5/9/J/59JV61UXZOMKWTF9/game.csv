"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850000? I believe this would still reflect the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $925000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your financial limitations. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise.

"Thank you for your continued effort to accommodate my budgetary constraints, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a final price of $915000 for the product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope this is a price that you can consider reasonable given the value of the product.",915000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. Unfortunately, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $915000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering a revised price of $918000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider selling it to you.",918000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer. I am unable to agree to a price higher than $915000 due to my budgetary constraints. I will now consider purchasing the product from John for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,8,
