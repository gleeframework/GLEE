"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is close, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you consider $13,500?  I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the price I've been considering all along. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,6,
