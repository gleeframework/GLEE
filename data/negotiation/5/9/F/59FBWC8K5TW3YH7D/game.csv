"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1400000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $1250000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1250000. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1300000 is closer to what I can afford, but I still need to be a little more conservative. Let's split the difference and settle on $1275000. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm eager to move forward.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1275000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1290000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can seal the deal at this price. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product, and I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to go to $1270000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. Let's make this happen.",1270000.0,Bob,6,
