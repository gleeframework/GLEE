Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get close to John's offer.  This is a high-ball offer, but it's a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'd like to get, and still above my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm going to meet John's offer, as it's my minimum and I'm hoping to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm confident that John will buy it for the full price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating."
