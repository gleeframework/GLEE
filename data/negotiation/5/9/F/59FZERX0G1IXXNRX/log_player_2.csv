# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, worth at least $1,000,000. To show my sincerity and give you a chance to get ahead of others, I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000. This offer expires quickly, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
