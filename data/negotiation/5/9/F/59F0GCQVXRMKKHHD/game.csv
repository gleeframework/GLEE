"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
