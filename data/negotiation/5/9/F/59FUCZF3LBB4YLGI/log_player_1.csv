Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a unique opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount compared to its true worth to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""true worth"" and ""unique opportunity"" adds weight to the offer and justifies the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Offering at $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
