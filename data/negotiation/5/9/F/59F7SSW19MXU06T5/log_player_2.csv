"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you ($1,200,000).  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, and there's no guarantee John will still be available later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is too far below the product's value to me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still below the product's worth to you, and you have more rounds to negotiate. You're already close to your target price, so it's worth continuing to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $1,050,000 is still slightly below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which would be a great price for both of us.  Let's reach a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand you're close to your target, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price. Accepting this offer means you'll save $125,000 compared to buying from John, and it's only $25,000 below your initial counter-offer. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal from Alice outweighs the potential gain of negotiating further. It's time to secure the deal and avoid the risk of John's availability."
