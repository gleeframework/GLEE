"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $900,000 is still a lot higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her perceived value of the product. This sets the stage for a negotiation and hopefully leads to a deal that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While I'd ideally like to get a lower price, Alice is starting to get closer to my preferred range.  With only 5 rounds left, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without risking running out of time and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
