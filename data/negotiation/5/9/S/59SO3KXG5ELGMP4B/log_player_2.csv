"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $95 is a decent deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and going to the next round gives you that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to get the price as close to your maximum of $80 as possible. A counteroffer of $75 is a reasonable starting point.  Alice knows she values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is within your budget and is a good deal considering you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While you could potentially get a lower price, there's no guarantee, and continuing to negotiate could lead to you running out of rounds or losing the opportunity to purchase from John."
