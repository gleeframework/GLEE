Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, but let me know if you're interested and we might be able to work something out."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know John will buy the product for $10,000, that's our absolute minimum.  Starting at Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) leaves no room for negotiation and might make him feel cheated.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility (""we might be able to work something out""). This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $8,000 but lower than our $10,000 goal.
* **Avoids revealing John:** We don't want Bob to know we have a guaranteed buyer, as this weakens our negotiating position. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially maximize profit. If Bob rejects the offer, we still have John as a guaranteed sale."
