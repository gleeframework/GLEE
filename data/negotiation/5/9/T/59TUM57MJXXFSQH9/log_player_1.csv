Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial High Offer:**  Starting with the highest price possible allows for maximum potential profit. 
* **Clear Message:** A direct and friendly message sets the tone for negotiation. 
* **Option to Walk Away:**  The offer implicitly reminds Bob that you have another buyer waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120 to see if we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:**  I've provided a clear explanation for the counteroffer, making it less likely that Bob will feel like I'm being unreasonable.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:** This keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and only slightly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Further negotiation:** I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John is a secure option:** If negotiations fail with Bob, I can still sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  Would you be willing to go up to $100?  This is my final offer, as I can easily sell to someone else for more. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This is presented as a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Increased Pressure:** Mentioning the other buyer (John) reinforces the potential loss for Bob if he doesn't accept.
* **Moderate Compromise:** $100 is still significantly lower than my initial price but higher than his last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while keeping the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations Stalled:** Bob's offer of $85 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better price. 
* **John is the Better Option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum price and a faster transaction."
