Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet at $127? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

It's clear Alice is not going to budge much below $125. At this point, the potential savings from haggling aren't worth the risk of her raising her price or the time it's taking. Buying from John for $150 is the safest option to ensure I get the product."
