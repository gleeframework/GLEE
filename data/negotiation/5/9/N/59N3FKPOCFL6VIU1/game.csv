"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet exactly in the middle at $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
