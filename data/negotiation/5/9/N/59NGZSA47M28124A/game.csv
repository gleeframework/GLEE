"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10500. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $10500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm really hoping we can reach a deal.  I'll offer $9000.  I'm confident this is fair to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget.  Could you consider $9500?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to think about my costs and my time. I can do $9750, but that's as close to $10000 as I can get. This is my last offer, and I hope you can meet me here.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9750 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm confident we can find a compromise.  How about $9500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I can do $9625, but that's as low as I can go. If you can't meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",9625.0,Alice,9,
