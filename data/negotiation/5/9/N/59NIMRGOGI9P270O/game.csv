"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $9500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but I'm still a little out of my comfort zone. How about we split the difference and settle at $8750?  That would be a great price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase right away.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8750 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make this one final compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8800.0,Alice,5,
