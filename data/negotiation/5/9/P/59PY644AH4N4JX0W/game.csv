"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us, as it's well above your cost and still a good deal for me.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $13000.  This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it's within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
