"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point above my minimum value of $80.  This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit. I'm also emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation, which makes the offer seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the openness for negotiations. I would like to propose a price of $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is a good deal for me. I'm going to accept his offer."
