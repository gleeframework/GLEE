{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't pay $115.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference at $97.5?"",

}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go that low. Let's wrap this up - $101, and it's yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems firm, and while I'd prefer to be closer to $90, getting the product for $101 is a decent deal. It's better to accept now than risk the negotiations stalling and missing out on a price below John's offer."
