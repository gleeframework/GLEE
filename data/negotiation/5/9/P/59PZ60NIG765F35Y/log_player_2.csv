"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you for $180. I think it's a steal at this price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to counter with a much lower price to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $50 for it."",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a low counter-offer gives me more room to negotiate upwards. While $50 is quite low, it signals that I'm looking for a bargain and forces Alice to re-evaluate her strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $180 might have been a bit high, $50 is far below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $130 is still significantly higher than my target price and what John is offering. I need to signal that I'm serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product has value, Alice, but $130 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we try $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show willingness to compromise, but still aiming significantly lower than Alice's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a more desirable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. Let's split the difference again and call it $100.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met my bottom price, which is the same as John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing the deal."
