"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1750000?  This would still leave some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1750000. How about $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little further.  $1600000 is still a fair price, considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal at $1650000. This way, we can both walk away feeling good about the transaction.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1650000. How about we meet in the middle at $1550000?,1550000.0,Bob,6,
