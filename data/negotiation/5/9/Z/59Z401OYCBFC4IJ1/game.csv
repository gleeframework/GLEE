,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $135.  I'm confident this is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $117.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good starting point to finalize the deal.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm ready to pay $115 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,6,
