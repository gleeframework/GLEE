Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive), while you secure a $20 profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price enticing enough for Bob to accept and profitable enough for you."
