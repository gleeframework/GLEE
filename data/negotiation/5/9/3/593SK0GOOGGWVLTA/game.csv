"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is just too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price recognizes your needs while still allowing me to achieve my goals. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,050,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This shows a genuine willingness to meet your needs while staying within my budget. Let's agree on this price and close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
