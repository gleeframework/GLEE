{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000 is a good starting point.** It's well above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **The message is friendly and optimistic.** This sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **I'm leaving room to counteroffer.**  It's likely Bob will counter, and I'm ready for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **I'm aware of the John alternative.** This gives me a firm bottom line. If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to push for a higher price to maximize my profits.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiating:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's low offer, I demonstrate my determination and show him that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **See if Bob is serious:**  His counteroffer will give me a better sense of his true willingness to pay."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is just too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm acknowledging Bob's offer:** This shows respect and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **I'm offering a compromise:**  $1,100,000 is halfway between my initial offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob:** I emphasize the ""great price"" and the opportunity to ""make this happen.""  This keeps Bob engaged and encourages him to see the value of my offer.
* **I'm still above my minimum:** While $1,100,000 is below my desired price, it's still significantly above my floor price of $1,500,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.

Here's why I'm rejecting Bob's offer:

* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate and that I have other options. This strengthens my negotiating position.
* **Pushing for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Evaluating Bob's seriousness:**  His willingness (or unwillingness) to increase his offer will tell me how motivated he is to buy the product.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to get a more favorable price, or I can walk away and sell the product to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price recognizes your needs while still allowing me to achieve my goals. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm acknowledging Bob's offer:** I show respect for his counteroffer and maintain a positive tone. 
* **I'm offering a compromise:** This time, I'm coming down slightly from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm still above my minimum and firmly within my desired range.
* **I'm emphasizing a fair deal:**  By stating that $1,050,000 is a ""fair deal for both of us"", I'm appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging him to see the benefit of accepting.
* **I'm creating urgency:**  By suggesting we ""close this deal and move forward"", I subtly nudge Bob to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually acceptable price that satisfies both Bob's needs and my own, while keeping the negotiation moving towards a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress, but $1,050,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This shows a genuine willingness to meet your needs while staying within my budget. Let's agree on this price and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It seems like we're reaching an impasse, and further negotiation might not yield a satisfactory outcome for me.

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,500,000. There's no risk involved, and I can be confident of receiving the full value of my product.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, potentially leading to a further delay in receiving payment.  Selling to John allows me to close the deal quickly and move on.
* **Limited potential for improvement:** Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  It's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer, making further negotiation a waste of time and energy.

While I would have preferred to negotiate a higher price with Bob,  selling to John is the most practical and financially sound decision at this point. It ensures I get the best possible price for my product and avoids further negotiation that may be unproductive."
