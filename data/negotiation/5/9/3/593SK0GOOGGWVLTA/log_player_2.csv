Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is just too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate lower. There's still room for compromise before he needs to consider buying from John."
