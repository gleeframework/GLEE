Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $125 is lower than Bob's valuation of $150, making the offer attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You've set a price that allows for potential counteroffers without immediately needing to accept a lower price. 

If Bob rejects your offer, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth negotiating further or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below what you initially offered.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, aiming for a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $110 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $117? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 117}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate but not to drastically lower your price.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This shows you're open to meeting Bob halfway.
* **It's still profitable for you:** This ensures you make a profit beyond selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about $117, I was thinking more like $113. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $113
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $113 is a good compromise. It's closer to your preferred price than your initial offer and still significantly higher than selling to John."
