"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I want to be fair. How about we settle at $1,125,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
