Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing my hand.
* **Alternative:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is above his perceived value ($1,000,000) but still significantly below my minimum ($1,200,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* I have a strong alternative with John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a strong return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a substantial concession from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement. However, I am not going below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can feel like a win for both parties. While it's a compromise, it keeps the price significantly above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits beyond just the price tag."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,450,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Met My Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches my absolute minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **No Guarantee of More:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree.  He's already moved significantly from his initial offer.
* **John as Backup:** While John offers the same price, it's generally preferable to close a deal with the current negotiating party if possible, as it avoids any potential complications or delays in switching to a backup buyer."
