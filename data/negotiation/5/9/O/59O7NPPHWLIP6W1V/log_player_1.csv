"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome. I don't know Bob's valuation, so it's important to start aggressively.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity of the product to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves room for negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to discuss the price. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a fallback option, ensuring I can still get at least $800,000 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Higher:**  I believe I can still get a better price than $950,000.  Bob's counteroffer shows he values the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation. It allows me to control the next step and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Room for Compromise:**  While I want more, I'm not rejecting the offer outright. This signals to Bob that I'm open to compromise, but not at his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to work with you, $950,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my initial asking price.
* **Bridging the Gap:** My message highlights that I'm trying to find a compromise, creating a sense of urgency to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob that $980,000 is still a fair price considering its potential benefits. 
* **Closing Language:**  I use phrases like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to accept my offer."
