"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $900,000?  This still leaves room for you to make a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
