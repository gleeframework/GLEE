"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a good deal, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still within Bob's budget and a good deal for him. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a further counter-offer and potentially losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
