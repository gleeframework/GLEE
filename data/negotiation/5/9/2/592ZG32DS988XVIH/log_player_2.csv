"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm sure I can find other uses for the extra $500 I'll save."
