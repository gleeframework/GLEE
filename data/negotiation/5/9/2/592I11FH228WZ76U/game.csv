"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm confident I can find a better deal elsewhere if we can't meet in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9500. It's still a good price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $10000, which would be $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
