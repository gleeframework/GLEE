"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""benefits"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer is a starting point.  I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see how high Bob might be willing to go. 
* **Alternative Option (John):**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't have to settle for anything below $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I will reject this offer and present a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer is serious, the value of this product is significant, and I can't accept less than $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $250,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still holding above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This keeps the door open for further negotiation but reinforces the product's value.
* **Positive Language:** The message uses positive language (""confident"", ""exceptional returns"") to emphasize the product's benefits and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and represents a significant profit. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting this offer secures a substantial gain and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
