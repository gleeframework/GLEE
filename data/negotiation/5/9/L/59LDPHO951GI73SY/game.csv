"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  It's a fair deal considering its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value of the product.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer, and I think it represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 still falls short of my expectations. Let's get closer to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
