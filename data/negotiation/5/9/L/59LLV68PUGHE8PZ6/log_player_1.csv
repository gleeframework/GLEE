Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value, also your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out. A good strategy is to aim for a price that splits the potential profit zone somewhat in your favor.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You acknowledge the product's value to Bob, building his interest.
* **Confident Price:** $1,150,000 gives you a significant profit of $150,000 above your minimum and leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves a little wiggle room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's exact valuation. If you had more information about his financial situation or how badly he needs the product, you might adjust your strategy accordingly."
