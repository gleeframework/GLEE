Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,000,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" for both of us emphasizes the potential for a win-win scenario, making Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives me space to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I have the option of moving to John, securing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to settle for such a big loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows that he is interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Plan B Still Available:**  If we can't reach an agreement, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $950,000 to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm Price:**  I'm not willing to go much lower than $950,000, as this is still a significant loss compared to my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Show Flexibility:**  By stating ""I'm willing to come down a bit,"" I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not desperate.
* **Keep the Pressure On:**  By setting a firm price and leaving room for him to counter, I'm encouraging Bob to continue negotiating and potentially bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still believe $850,000 is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value of the product. I would like to stick to this figure to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for negotiation:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $850,000 offer, refusing to budge.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a more favorable price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time, potentially missing out on a better deal with John. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  By selling to John for $1,200,000, I can secure my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing a significant profit. 

It's better to accept a sure thing with John than to risk losing time and money with Bob's persistent lowball offer."
