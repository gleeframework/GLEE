"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which would still be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
