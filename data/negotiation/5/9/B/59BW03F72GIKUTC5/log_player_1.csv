{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  This strategy allows me to maximize potential profit while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin. I hope this will be a tempting offer for Bob, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which would still be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired profit margin.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $10,000 is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit that is just below my ideal but still a significant gain."
