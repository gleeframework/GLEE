"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A starting offer of $70 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses interest in the product while clearly stating the price is too high. 
* **Goal:** The goal is to see how much Alice is willing to move on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. How about $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than the initial offer, it's still a bit high. We have room to negotiate further, especially since we have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims for a price that is a fair compromise between Alice's last offer ($90) and our previous offer ($70). 
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward and suggests a specific price, keeping the negotiation moving.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're still keeping John's offer of $100 in mind as a potential fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $85 for the product, is that something you'd consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $85 is a solid price, representing a $15 discount from Alice's original offer. 
* **Time Factor:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to push for a lower price might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Acceptable Savings:** While we could buy from John for $100, saving $15 is a decent outcome."
