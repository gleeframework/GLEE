"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe this product will be a great addition to your collection, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle somewhere around $10,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, that price is still a bit high for me.  I could potentially do $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $12,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've already conceded. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
