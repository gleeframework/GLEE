"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While $12,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
