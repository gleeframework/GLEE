"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",92.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $89.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90.50 and $89.50, which is $90. I think this is a fair compromise.",90.0,Alice,9,
