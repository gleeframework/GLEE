"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering the product for $100, which is your maximum price. However, John is also selling the same product for $100.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John or find a better deal elsewhere."
