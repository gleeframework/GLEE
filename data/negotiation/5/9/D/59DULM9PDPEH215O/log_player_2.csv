(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Alice's offer is still too high, so you should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for some negotiation. It's also below your maximum budget, giving you some wiggle room."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you can get from John. You have a better alternative, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating. You might be able to get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown Alice you're serious about negotiating a lower price. This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, but it's still below her offer, leaving room for potential agreement. It's also close enough to your maximum budget to be worthwhile if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you can get from John. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll reach a better price. It's more efficient to take the guaranteed deal with John and save yourself time and effort."
