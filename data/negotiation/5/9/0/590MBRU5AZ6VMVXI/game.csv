"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $1,075,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the budget I'm working with.  Let me know what you think.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1,090,000. I believe this is the lowest I can go and still make the sale worthwhile for me.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,090,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000. This is a reasonable offer considering the value of the product and the progress we've made. Let's work together to find a solution.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not willing to go below $1,090,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
