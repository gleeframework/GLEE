Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Open-Ended:** My message leaves room for Bob to ask questions and negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and appealing to Bob's value perception, I aim to get a good price while leaving room to negotiate if needed. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be ready to counteroffer and potentially work towards a price closer to his value. However, if the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting a fair price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I want for the product. 
* **Negotiation is worth it:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. However, if the negotiation continues to stall, I'll be prepared to fall back on John's offer of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price. 
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended:** Again, I leave room for further discussion and negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that satisfies both parties.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider my options: further negotiation, or selling to John for $80."
