"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. I think this is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
