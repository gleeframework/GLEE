"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? ",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $7,000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
