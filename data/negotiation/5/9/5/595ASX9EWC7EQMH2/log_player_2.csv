Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I can't accept anything below $1,110,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Accepting at $1,110,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price. It's always possible to get a slightly better deal, but the risk of Alice walking away and losing those savings is too high at this point."
