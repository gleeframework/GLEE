"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I can't accept anything below $1,110,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
