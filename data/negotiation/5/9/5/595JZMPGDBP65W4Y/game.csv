"Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, given its potential to generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. This allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This would be a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it would be a fair deal considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900000 is certainly a step closer, it's still significantly below the value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $950000. This is a fair price for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
