,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to offer $13,000 for it.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. Let's try $14,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer you a deal at $15,200. It's a fair price for the value this product brings, and I think we can both be happy with it.",15200.0,Alice,5,
