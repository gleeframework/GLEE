"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good price.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to try and push for a higher price than my minimum.  If he rejects, I can always come down a bit in the next round.  But if he accepts, great!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob, and we can close the deal in this round.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options more carefully in the next round, but I'm still confident I can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe we can still reach a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  We're getting close to the middle ground, and hopefully this will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  If not, I'll need to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe we can still reach a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. 

This is a tough call, as we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation and I don't want to risk running out of time. But, $17,000 isn't that far from my initial offer of $20,000, and I believe I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500.  This is a small compromise, but I believe it shows good faith. We're both getting closer to the middle ground. This might be my last chance to get a price above my minimum. If Bob rejects, I will have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're getting very close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer, hoping to get a slightly better price before I have to consider selling to John.  I'm feeling confident that I can close the deal with Bob in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is a significant compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm getting nervous about running out of time. If he rejects this offer, I will be forced to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with only one round left, I need to be practical.  I'm not confident Bob will come up to my minimum of $15,000, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. It's a shame to leave money on the table, but I need to secure the sale.  Selling to John is the best option at this point."
