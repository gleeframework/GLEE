"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested, but $7,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $6,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $6,900. This is a compromise that I think will satisfy both of us.",6900.0,Alice,3,
