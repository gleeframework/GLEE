"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,150,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers -  $1,075,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,090,000.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this done.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  How about we meet at $1,080,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. ",1080000.0,Bob,6,
