"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,150,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers -  $1,075,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price in the middle of Alice's last offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a quicker agreement."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,090,000.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this done.
