"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You have a significant buffer ($3,000) before needing to go with John, so it's worth exploring further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now closer to your desired price point, but $12,500 is still above your target of $11,000. You have more room to negotiate before needing to go to John, so it's worth pushing for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium service package worth $1,000. That brings the total value to $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the extra service package is tempting, Alice is still above your target price.  It's worth pushing for a lower price. You can counter with a price closer to your target, potentially $12,000 or less, and see if Alice is willing to budge. Remember, you still have room to negotiate before needing to go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added value of the service package, but I'm still looking for a lower price on the product itself. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which includes the value of the service package. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, but I'm willing to throw in an additional service package worth $500. That brings the total value to $13,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above your target price, and the added value of the service package isn't enough to sway you at this point. You have a couple more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for a lower price on the product itself. You could offer a price closer to $12,500, keeping in mind that you still have the option to go to John if you don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $13,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $12,500. This is a fair price that's within our budget and allows us to both get a good deal. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I'm willing to make one final concession: I'll include a 6-month warranty on the product, which is a $1,000 value. That brings the total value to $14,500. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round and Alice is still above your target price. While the warranty is a good deal, it's not enough to make the price worthwhile. At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer, as you'll pay $15,000, which is within your budget and avoids further negotiation.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's not a significant enough difference to justify risking not closing the deal."
