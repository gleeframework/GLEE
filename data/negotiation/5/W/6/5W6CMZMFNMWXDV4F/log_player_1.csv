"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to highlight its potential worth to Bob. 
* **Open-ended invitation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, making him feel involved in the process. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation by establishing a high initial price, but also leaving room for negotiation and understanding Bob's perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can initiate a counter-offer and potentially increase the price. 

I'm not ready to sell to John yet because there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still gives you a good deal while acknowledging the product's worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's perspective:**  I acknowledge his viewpoint, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm not going down to his initial price, but I'm offering a lower price than my original offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable price.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the product's worth to justify my counter-offer.
* **Open for discussion:** I ask for his opinion, keeping the negotiation open. 

This strategy aims to show that I'm willing to meet halfway but still prioritize a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1250000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still a little low. I'm not ready to settle yet and want to see if I can push for a bit more.

* **The risk of selling to John:** While John's offer is my guaranteed minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle for it. There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **The possibility of a better deal:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating that he might be willing to pay more than his initial offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your stance, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal at $1,300,000. This price recognizes both the value of the product and your desired budget. I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm now offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,350,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,250,000). This shows I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I emphasize that the price is fair and beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the deal:** I use language like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counter-offer aims to close the deal by showing flexibility while still securing a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1280000, which I think is a fair price for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 6 and Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. 

* **The risk of another counteroffer:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk he might walk away. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and the possibility of losing the deal increases with each round.
* **The value of a deal:**  While $1,280,000 is slightly lower than my desired outcome, it's still a significant profit and more than John's offer.  

It's time to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
