Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

This is the best possible outcome for Bob at this point. Alice has come down to her lowest price, which is still a significant savings compared to John's offer."
