"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Asking for Opinion:**  Asking for Bob's opinion opens the door for a conversation and potential counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees I don't lose money, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counter-offer, acknowledging Bob's offer while staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Reasoning & Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason to accept my counter-offer by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""find a middle ground"" signals that I'm still open to further negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $95 is very close to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There are still rounds left, so I'm not willing to settle yet.  I believe I can still convince Bob to go a bit higher.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $100 is always an option, but I'm committed to getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to reach my minimum while giving you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it difficult for Bob to reject without feeling like he's being unreasonable.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both of us, further pushing the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Finality:** By suggesting it's ""a great deal"" and asking ""What do you think?"", I'm implying that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  
* **Risk of Lower Price:** There's a risk that Bob will keep lowering his offer, and I may end up with a price significantly below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's more important to ensure I don't lose money."
