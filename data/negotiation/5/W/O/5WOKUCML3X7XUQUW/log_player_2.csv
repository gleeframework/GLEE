"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice, bringing the price closer to your acceptable range. If Alice doesn't budge, you can always buy from John at a much lower price."
