"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It allows you to acquire the product for a price below its value to you, and it gives me a strong return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This price is still above your value for the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired price. I have 8 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a higher price. It's too early to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit margin for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 is still below my target. I have 6 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a higher price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 at this point would be a loss for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still too far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,090,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
