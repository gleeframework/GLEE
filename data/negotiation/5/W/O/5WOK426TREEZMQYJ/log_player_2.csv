"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It allows you to acquire the product for a price below its value to you, and it gives me a strong return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price, it's still too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 more rounds, providing ample opportunity to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This price is still above your value for the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit margin for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still a bit higher than Bob wants to pay.  Since there are still 7 rounds left, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still too far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,090,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is still aiming for a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting very close to his desired price and a good deal for him.  With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or force Bob to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer now secures a good price and minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
