"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me at the moment. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $775,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
