"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal.  He's aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's value of $100, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price.  He has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and there are still rounds left. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise.  He's raised his offer slightly from $105, showing willingness to negotiate. $107.50 is a midpoint between his last offer and Alice's offer, making it a reasonable compromise point. This also keeps the price close to his target of saving as much money as possible."
