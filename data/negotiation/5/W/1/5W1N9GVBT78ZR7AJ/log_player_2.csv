"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects the quality and the worth that you perceive in the product, making it a fair deal for both of us. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price ($120)** is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $30** compared to buying from John. 
* While the product is worth $80 to Alice, that information is irrelevant to your decision. Your goal is to get the best price for yourself, not to worry about Alice's profit margin."
