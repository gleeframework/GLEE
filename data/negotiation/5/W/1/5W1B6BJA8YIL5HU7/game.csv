"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I understand you have a budget, but  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $12,000 is still not quite where I need to be, but I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
