"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I understand you have a budget, but  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $12,000 is still not quite where I need to be, but I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
