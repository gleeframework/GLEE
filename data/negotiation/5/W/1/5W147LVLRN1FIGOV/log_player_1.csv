Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game changer for your business. I've set the price at $950,000, reflecting its value and potential. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm open to discussing it further. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant opportunity.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $800,000. I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is closer to your offer but still ensures I can cover my costs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you, and I believe we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
