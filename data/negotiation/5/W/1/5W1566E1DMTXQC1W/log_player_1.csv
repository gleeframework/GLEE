Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
I'm not willing to sell for $90, but I'm open to negotiating further.  I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before I sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more than I would get from John."", ""product_price"": 102.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original ask, Alice. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

While $95 is closer to my goal, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I want to see if Bob will come up a bit more before I settle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 100}
