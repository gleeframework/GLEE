"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, considering the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to reflect your interest. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value this product provides.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This offer reflects a fair value considering the product's worth to me and my budget constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is still far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,250,000. This represents a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive and my need to recoup my investment.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise considering the value I'll receive and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and allows me to cover my costs. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal, and I hope we can finalize it quickly.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise considering the value I'll receive and my budget constraints.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. To be honest, I'm getting ready to accept John's offer of $1,500,000.  However, to show you my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
