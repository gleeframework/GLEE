It's not worth buying from Alice at that price.  A counteroffer is the best strategy to see if you can get a better deal."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Another counteroffer might get you closer to your desired price."

This counteroffer is a compromise,  showing you're willing to pay more than your previous offer, but still significantly less than Alice's.  It keeps the negotiations moving and may get Alice to meet you in the middle."

Alice has come down a bit more, but it's still not quite the price you're looking for. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

This counteroffer is a small increase from your last offer, showing you're getting closer to Alice's price. However, it's still below her offer, leaving room for negotiation. This might encourage Alice to accept your offer, or lead to a final counteroffer from her side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and while it's still a little higher than your initial target, it's getting close. At this point, it's probably better to accept her offer.  Continuing to negotiate might risk her going back to her previous price or even walking away from the deal altogether."
