"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested,  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $90? I'm very keen on this product and think it could be a great fit for me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the value it can bring to you. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. While I understand the value of the product, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $105.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go much lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $107? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",107.0,Alice,5,
