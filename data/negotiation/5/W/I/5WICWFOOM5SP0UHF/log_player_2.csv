{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you have a maximum price of $15,000, you have room to go lower than Alice's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $7,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. It also leaves room for some back-and-forth before reaching my maximum price of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a lower price. I'm keeping in mind my maximum price of $15,000 and trying to find a middle ground."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit too high. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $7,800.  I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer, but still trying to get a better deal.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, so I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm increasing my price by a small amount, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be forced to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,025. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,025
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's down to the wire, and although Alice's offer is still above my preferred price, I'm going to accept it. We've been going back and forth for a while, and there's a good chance we won't be able to agree on a lower price.  It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
