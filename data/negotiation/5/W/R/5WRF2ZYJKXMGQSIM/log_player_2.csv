"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate.  It's something you've been looking for and I'm sure it would be worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($120) is better than John's offer ($150).** 
* You value the product at $150, so paying $120 represents a saving of $30. 
* While the product is only worth $80 to Alice, it's still a better deal for you to buy it from her than from John."
