{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $100. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth to you, and it's fair for me. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much and is getting close to my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, selling to John at $100 is a safe and guaranteed option. It's a better decision than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting stuck at a lower price."
