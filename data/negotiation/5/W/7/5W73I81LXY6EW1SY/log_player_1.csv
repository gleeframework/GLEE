Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already made a counteroffer of $1,250,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. Can you please confirm if you're willing to sell it to me at this price?

At this point, Bob has refused to budge on his price, and I've already made several counteroffers.  While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'd prefer.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, and it's the most sensible decision to avoid further negotiation and secure a decent profit."
