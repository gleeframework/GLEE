"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's closer to that value.  This gives Alice a chance to still make a profit while giving Bob a better price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's better than John's offer of $15,000, and while it's not the absolute lowest price, it's close to Bob's desired range and likely leaves enough profit for Alice to make the sale.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would only result in a small price reduction, and the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and Bob having to buy from John is not worth the potential small gain."
