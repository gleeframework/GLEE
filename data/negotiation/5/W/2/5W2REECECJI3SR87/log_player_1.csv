Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is $2000 lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him a good incentive to purchase. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, so I have room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
