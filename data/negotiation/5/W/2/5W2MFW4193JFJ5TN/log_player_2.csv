"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to extend this offer at $120. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a decent discount from Alice's valuation, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to spend no more than $100.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $110 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the $100 price point. While Alice's offer is closer, it's still above Bob's target. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $105. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while also accommodating your budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for $100. While Alice's offer is now within his budget, it's still above his target. There are still rounds left, so Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He's close to his goal, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to accept his original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get this for $100. That's my final offer - let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the value of the product and your interest, I am willing to sell it to you for $102. This is my final offer within the negotiation process. I hope we can agree upon this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is only $2 above Bob's target, he's already had a few rounds where Alice has refused to budge on his desired price of $100.  There are only 3 rounds left, and with each round, the risk increases that Alice might reject his counteroffers, or that they will be unable to come to an agreement. It's best for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John at $100 to avoid the potential for further negotiation delays and a higher price."
