Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and securing a deal.  Here's why:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:** $14,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Lower than John's offer:** This gives Bob a chance to get a deal, even if it's slightly less than what he'd ideally pay.
* **Potential for a quick sale:** Bob might accept the offer quickly to secure the product, rather than risk losing it to John. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then sell to John for $15,000."
