"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $16000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
