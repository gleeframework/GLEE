"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. 
* This means Bob can potentially save $500 by negotiating.
* It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I'm still looking for closer to my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, offering $9,250.
* This is still $250 less than John's price, making it a better deal for Bob.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go lower, and the risk of losing the deal is higher."
