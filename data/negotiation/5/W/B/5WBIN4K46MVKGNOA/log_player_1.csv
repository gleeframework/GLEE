{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $11,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($4,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential gain ($1,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $8,000 gives you leverage. It's better to aim high with Bob and potentially negotiate down than to start low and limit your potential earnings."
