"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me right now. How about $110? I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, but still showing interest.  He's aiming for a price closer to his personal value but leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  He has shown he is willing to negotiate and knows the product is worth less than Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating towards a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120. However, I'm still a little too high. How about $115? That's a fair price that's closer to where I can realistically buy it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating that he is willing to negotiate but still wants to get a good deal. He is also highlighting the fact that $115 is a ""fair"" price, subtly suggesting it's a good deal for both parties. This keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much."
