"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still allows me to get a fair value for the product while giving you a substantial price advantage. Let's find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on price. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go while still ensuring a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this product will be a valuable addition to your portfolio.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
