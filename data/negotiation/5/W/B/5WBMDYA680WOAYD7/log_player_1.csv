Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price.  This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and negotiate further. But if he rejects my initial offer, I still have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price. I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob will find this price acceptable, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal, and I'm prepared to walk away if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is my final offer. It's a significant compromise from my initial price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
