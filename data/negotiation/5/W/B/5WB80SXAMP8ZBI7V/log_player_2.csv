Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your minimum, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer. How about we settle on $900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more move to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely she'll come down significantly from her $1,050,000 offer. At this point, accepting her offer would mean overpaying by $50,000 compared to John's offer. It's strategically advantageous to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
