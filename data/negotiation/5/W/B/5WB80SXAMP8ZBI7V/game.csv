"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your minimum, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer. How about we settle on $900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more move to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
