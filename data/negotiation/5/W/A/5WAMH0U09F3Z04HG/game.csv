"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $110. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for this product.",125.0,Alice,5,
