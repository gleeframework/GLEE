"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider it?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13000, which is my absolute lowest price. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12800. Can you consider it?",12800.0,Bob,6,
