Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a more realistic middle ground here. I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is still very far below a reasonable price. We have room to negotiate but need to incentivize him to offer significantly more."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can offer $800,000, but I can't go any higher. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum price and is unwilling to budge. While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's substantially less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
