{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and hopefully avoid immediate rejection.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers.

**Important Notes:**

* **John as a Safety Net:**  While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I'm aware I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, which gives me leverage.  
* **Strategic Counteroffers:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I will need to analyze his offer and my potential profit to determine whether to accept, counter, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation. While I need to be mindful of John's offer, I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll need to craft a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's $850,000 but still leaves room for further negotiation. I need to consider how much risk I'm willing to take based on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $850,000 is still too far below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to facilitate a deal. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $950,000 represents a significant concession from my initial offer, while still maintaining a comfortable margin above Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also shows I won't settle for a price that is too far below my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify my price. This helps reinforce the rationale behind my counteroffer.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I use language like ""fair compromise"" and ""find common ground"" to encourage a collaborative approach and signal my desire to reach an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. Depending on his next move, I'll either accept his counteroffer (if it's closer to my desired price), make another counteroffer, or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and increase his offer. There's a good chance I can push him closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll need to carefully consider a counteroffer that bridges the gap but keeps me above my minimum.  I'll also need to factor in the time spent negotiating and the potential risk of Bob walking away.  
* **Assess the Situation:** I need to weigh the potential of a better offer from Bob against the guaranteed offer from John. The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more risk I take of losing out on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your position, $900,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a final offer that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this counteroffer as a final offer to incentivize Bob to make a decision. This also adds a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm reiterating that this is a ""fair outcome"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and hopefully push him towards acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** This is a crucial point in the negotiation. I'll need to carefully analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if he makes one), sell to John, or risk further negotiations. 
* **Time Management:**  I'll need to consider the time spent negotiating and the potential opportunity cost of not accepting John's offer."
