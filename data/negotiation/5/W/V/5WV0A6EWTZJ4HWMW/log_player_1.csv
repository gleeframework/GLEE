Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer, along with the offer itself:

**Alice's Strategy**

* **Maximum Potential:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. That's her ceiling.
* **Minimum Acceptable:** Alice will get $1,000,000 from John, so she shouldn't go below that.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a $200,000 gap where both Alice and Bob can potentially benefit.
* **Aim High:** Alice should start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering what you could gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Approach Works**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,150,000 gives Alice negotiating room if Bob counters.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, not just the price.
* **Fairness Perception:** The phrase ""fair deal"" aims to make Bob feel like he's not being taken advantage of.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  Her willingness to negotiate slightly downward (while staying above $1,000,000) will likely result in a successful sale."
