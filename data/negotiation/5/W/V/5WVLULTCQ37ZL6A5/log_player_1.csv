"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing the value of the product to build rapport.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  $150 is higher than my minimum, giving Bob an opportunity to counter without feeling like he has to accept immediately. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response (whether he accepts or makes a counteroffer) and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $120 is lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $120.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I'd rather try to get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $150 while still being within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $150 to $135, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** $135 is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum threshold of $100.
* **Room for Further Discussion:** By offering $135, I'm giving Bob some room to counter again without feeling like he's being forced to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to accept a counteroffer from him or continue negotiating. If he rejects, I'll need to consider the potential of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I think $135 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob's counteroffer of $125 is only a $5 increase from his previous offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still negotiate a price closer to my initial offer of $150. There's still room for negotiation within a reasonable range.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John for $100 would be a safe option, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price while acknowledging his willingness to compromise. I'll need to be careful not to push him away with an unreasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $130?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my last offer ($135) and Bob's latest offer ($125). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet him in the middle.
* **Fair Price:** $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, making it a fair deal for me. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only 5 rounds left, I need to make progress towards a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response to this offer. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $100, as I'm running out of time and negotiation room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close, but I think I can do better than that. How about $128? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $128 is only $2 away from my previous counteroffer of $130. It's getting very close to my desired price range.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to our last 4 rounds.  There's a risk that we could get stuck in a back-and-forth that doesn't lead to a deal.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** While I'd ideally like to get a bit closer to my initial price, I'm comfortable with $128, as it's significantly higher than John's offer of $100.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This ensures I get a good price for the product without risking a failed negotiation or losing out on a valuable opportunity."
