{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still too high.  It is now only one round before Bob is forced to accept a price he's not happy with or buy from John.
