"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product will bring to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to offer $980000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and expectations.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a balance between our previous offers, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1030000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one last offer of $980000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,6,
