"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not ready to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $800,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
