"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can do $128, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",128.0,Alice,5,
