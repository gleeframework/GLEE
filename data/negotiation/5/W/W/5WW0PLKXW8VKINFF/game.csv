"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
