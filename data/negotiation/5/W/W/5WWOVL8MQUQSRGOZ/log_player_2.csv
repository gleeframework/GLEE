"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to save $200,000 compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.  Bob should see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, he's now only $150,000 above John's price. The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might reject and Bob could end up paying John's full price.  It's better to lock in the deal now and save some money."
