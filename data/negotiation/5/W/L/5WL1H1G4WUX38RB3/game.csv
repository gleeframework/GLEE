"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a fair price for a product of this caliber, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we try $9800? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still looking to save a bit more, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we try $11000? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not quite there, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm looking to get closer to my target price. How about we try $9500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. How about we try $10800? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10800 and $9500, so how about $10150? I think that's a fair price for this product.",10150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10150. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. How about we try $10800 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $500. That way, you'll get an even better value for your money.",10800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10800 and $9500, and I'll throw in an additional $50 to sweeten the deal. How about $10000? I think that's a fair price for the product and the extras you're offering.",10000.0,Bob,10,
