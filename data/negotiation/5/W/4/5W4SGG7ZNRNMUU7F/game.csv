"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Based on its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This price reflects its worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise.  I believe this price remains fair considering the product's potential for your business.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
