"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer of $90, but I would need to ensure that I cover my costs. Therefore, I propose a final offer of $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is within your budget and represents a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to sell or you'll end up paying more from John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
