Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before going to John (who guarantees $120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures you get a great price.
* **Psychology:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price can make Bob feel like he's getting a deal, increasing the chances he'll accept."
