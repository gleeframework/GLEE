"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to spend closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair offer and closer to what I had in mind.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm open to negotiation.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $85? It's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,5,
