Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. My asking price is $110, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:**  Starting high allows for more potential profit.
* **Encourage Bob to negotiate:**  A higher price will make Bob more motivated to counteroffer.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to spend closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. This keeps the negotiation going and gives me a better chance of securing a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price of $90, which is halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($60).  This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my willingness to negotiate, but I emphasize that I need to get a fair price. This keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to my preferred price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in to Bob's initial low offer.
* **Encourage Bob to counter again:** The counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, making it likely he will counter again.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** The $90 offer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, allowing me to potentially secure a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair offer and closer to what I had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, it's still below it. Selling at this price would mean a loss for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. 

I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price while still showing a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm open to negotiation.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $85? It's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($75). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Message:** I reiterate my openness to negotiation, highlighting that I am trying to find a price that works for both of us. This keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to come up on his offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the Gap:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, I show a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Maintain a Profit:** The price is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Pressure Bob to Accept:**  The counteroffer is closer to my minimum, making it more likely Bob will accept or counter with a price closer to my preferred range."
