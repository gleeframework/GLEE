"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your operations. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its significant value.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's less than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum value for the product ($1,000,000). 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.** Bob can potentially counter-offer Alice or see if he can get a better deal from John."
