"Alice,  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I'm interested in your product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I'm willing to pay for this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is lower than what I initially envisioned, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1200000. This price reflects a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it still offers you a good value given the product's potential.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still slightly above what I can afford. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
