"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique value proposition it offers.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a price that is fair to both of us.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
