"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can't go all the way down to $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference again and go with $97.50? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",97.5,Alice,5,
