"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would still be a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
