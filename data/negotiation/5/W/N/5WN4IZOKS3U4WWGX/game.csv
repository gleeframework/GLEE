"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the $800,000 range. I would like to make a counteroffer at $900,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $900,000 falls short of my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, recognizing your budget constraints.  This price allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget considerations, I am unable to meet your latest proposal of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $950,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
