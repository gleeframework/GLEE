Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000.  I know its value to you is significant, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) might seem too aggressive and could make Bob less likely to negotiate. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, giving her a strong fallback position."
