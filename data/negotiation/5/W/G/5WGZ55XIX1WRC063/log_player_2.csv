You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $7,150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly getting close to her minimum, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting $7,150 gets you the product for a good price, even if it's not quite as low as you hoped.  Going further risks losing the deal and having to settle for John's $8,000 price."
