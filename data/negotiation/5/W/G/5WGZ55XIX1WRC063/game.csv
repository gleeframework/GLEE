"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not comfortable with $6,500 either. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $7,250, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,250 is still a touch higher than I hoped.  Would you consider $7,100? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget.",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $7,150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",7150.0,Alice,7,
