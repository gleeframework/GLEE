"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $150 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 120

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $120 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $90 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $90 offer. Accepting would mean losing potential profit. It's more advantageous to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
