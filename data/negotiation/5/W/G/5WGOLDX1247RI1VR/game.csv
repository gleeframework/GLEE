"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to do $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $110 is too low for me. This product is really valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit from it. How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly interested in the product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. $125 is still a bit low for me. What if we settle at $140?  That's a pretty significant discount from my original offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $130. It's a fair compromise and gives you a decent price, while staying within my limits.",130.0,Bob,6,
