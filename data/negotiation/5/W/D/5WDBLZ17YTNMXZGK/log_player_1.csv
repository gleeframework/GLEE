Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at $12,000 gives Bob a significant discount (saving him $4,000) and potentially motivates him to buy now. This price also earns me a $4,000 profit above my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still some wiggle room to negotiate a slightly lower price, getting closer to his $8,000 perceived value while still exceeding my $15,000 minimum."
