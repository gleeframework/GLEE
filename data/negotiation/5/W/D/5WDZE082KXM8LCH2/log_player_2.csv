"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a price that offers a strong return on your investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
