"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $700,000?  I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is still pushing my limit.  Would you be willing to settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair offer considering we're both making concessions.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
