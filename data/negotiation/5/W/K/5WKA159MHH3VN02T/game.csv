"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and the original price I had in mind.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer you $875,000 for the product. This price is fair,  allowing us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'll meet you at $890,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",890000.0,Alice,5,
