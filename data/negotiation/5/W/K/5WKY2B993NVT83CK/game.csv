"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen.  How about $1,625,000? This is a significant price reduction on my end, demonstrating my willingness to close this deal.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the price reduction, but $1,625,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
