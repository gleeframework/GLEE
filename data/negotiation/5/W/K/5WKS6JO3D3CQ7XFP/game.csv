"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can make this work.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
