Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.
