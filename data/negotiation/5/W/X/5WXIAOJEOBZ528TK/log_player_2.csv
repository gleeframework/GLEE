# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and while I could try to haggle further, $10,800 is a good price and saves me $1,200 compared to John's offer."
