{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is significantly above your minimum acceptable price, but also leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while also maintaining a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too low.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would like to get a higher price,  selling to John for $800,000 ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
