"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $140 is too low for me.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $140 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $157.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 157.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, as I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $145 is an improvement, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $152.50.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 152.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $152.50 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $148? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more from Bob, time is running out, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John for $150 is a safe bet and ensures I at least get my minimum desired price."
