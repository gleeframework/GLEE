"I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $140 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $157.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with this product.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $157.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $145 is an improvement, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $152.50.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $152.50 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $148?",148.0,Bob,6,
