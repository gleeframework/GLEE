Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  By offering it at $1,400,000, we leave a significant margin for Bob ($100,000) while still securing a profit of $200,000 above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of acceptance. It creates a sense of a good deal for Bob while still being highly advantageous for us.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, which gives us leverage in this negotiation. We're not desperate, allowing us to aim higher with Bob."
