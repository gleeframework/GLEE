"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  This product is valuable, but I'm on a budget. How about we bring the price down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is my final compromise, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
