Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is my final compromise, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated Alice down to $975,000, a $25,000 savings from her starting price and a $25,000 savings from John's offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice has indicated this is her final compromise. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate, and you could risk losing the deal.
* **Time Investment:** Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. The potential savings from here on out might not be worth the additional rounds of bargaining."
