Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  By using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,""  you aim to frame the product as desirable and potentially worth more than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer and start a discussion. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
