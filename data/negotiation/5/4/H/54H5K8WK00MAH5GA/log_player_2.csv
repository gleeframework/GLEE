"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price closer to his maximum value ($120). Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing Bob is serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you really want this product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $108.  How about $106?  I'm really interested in this product and want to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly negotiating down the price.  Offering $106 shows a genuine interest in buying while still aiming for a price closer to his ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really eager to make a deal, Bob! I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I can offer it to you for $109. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $109, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a small decrease in price, and Bob might risk losing the deal altogether. At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option to ensure a purchase within his budget."
