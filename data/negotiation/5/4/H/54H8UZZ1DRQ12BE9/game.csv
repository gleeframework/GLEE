"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me.  How about we start with something around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500. How about we try $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
