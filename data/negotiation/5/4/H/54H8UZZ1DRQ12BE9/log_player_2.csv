"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than yours. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me.  How about we start with something around $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a lower offer to understand Alice's flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, we are trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to continue the negotiation (""How about we start..."").

It's a balancing act. We want to save money but also need to avoid being too aggressive and risk Alice losing interest or walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to our desired price range, $8,500 is still above our maximum budget. We know we have a guaranteed option at $8,000 with John.  There's room for Alice to come down further, so it's worth negotiating at least one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** We're holding firm below our $8,000 walk-away point but moving closer to it, signaling to Alice we're serious but flexible.
* **Justification:**  By saying $8,500 is ""still a bit of a stretch,"" we give a soft reason for our counter without revealing our absolute limit.
* **Urgency and Collaboration:**  Mentioning we're ""hoping to find a price that works for both of us"" subtly implies time might be a factor (John's offer) and encourages a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500. How about we try $8,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our maximum budget. We have no incentive to negotiate further as John is offering the same price. Taking Alice's offer secures the product at our target price."
