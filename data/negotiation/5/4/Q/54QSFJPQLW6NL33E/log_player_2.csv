{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. While it's unlikely Alice will immediately accept this, it establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows your intent to acquire the product at a price that benefits you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you'd ideally like to pay.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate allows you to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further attempt to narrow the gap. It's a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's most recent one, and hopefully pushes her closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $50,000 more than your last counteroffer.  It's a reasonable price, considering your goal is to save money.  Further negotiation could potentially save you more, but the risk of Alice walking away and you having to buy from John at a significantly higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action at this point."
