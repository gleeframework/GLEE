"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay up to $1200000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product for $1800000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1500000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to bridge the gap, Bob, but $1500000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1700000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1600000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's work together to find a final price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $1600000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,7,
