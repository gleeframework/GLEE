"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point.  I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, clearly communicating my willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm upper limit. This establishes my position and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product for $1800000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my preferred price point. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll reject the offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm gradually increasing my offer, but I'm still keeping it well below Alice's price. I'm also expressing confidence in reaching a deal, which might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to bridge the gap, Bob, but $1500000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1700000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above my comfort zone. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for $1,700,000 just yet. I'll try to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,600,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's work together to find a final price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm slowly increasing my offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal.  However, I'm still staying within my budget and pushing for a better price. I'm also emphasizing the need for a ""final"" price, suggesting that I'm nearing my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $1600000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. We're at a stalemate, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will yield a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, ensuring I get the product while staying within my budget."
