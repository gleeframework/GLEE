"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $180? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure if $180 is the best fit for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $180 was a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",160.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not sure if $160 is the best fit for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings.,145.0,Bob,6,
