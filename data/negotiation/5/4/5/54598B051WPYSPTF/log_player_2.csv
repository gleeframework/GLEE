"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your position, however, I know the value of this product, and I can't go lower than $9,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still better than John's price of $10,000.  While Bob ideally wants to pay even less, further negotiation might risk Alice walking away, leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without risking missing out."
