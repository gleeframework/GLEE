You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm confident I can negotiate further and get a better price.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest price. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I still believe a lower price is achievable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I've already made multiple counteroffers without success. It's clear that further negotiation may not lead to a lower price. To avoid further delays and stay within my budget, it's better to buy the product from John for $15,000. This ensures I get the product within my price range."
