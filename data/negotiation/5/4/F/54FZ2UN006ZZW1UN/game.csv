"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value this product holds for me. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $13,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'll make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
