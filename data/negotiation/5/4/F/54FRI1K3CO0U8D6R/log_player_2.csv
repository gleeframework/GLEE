"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's clear that Alice's offer is way too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

While Alice's offer is closer to what Bob is willing to pay, it's still above his desired price point. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
