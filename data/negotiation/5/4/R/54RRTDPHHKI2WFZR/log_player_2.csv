"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly far greater than that.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,450,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000.  This represents a fair price, allowing both of us to achieve a successful outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's settle this right now - $1,300,000 and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer to his desired price, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no immediate need to accept a price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I understand your need to get a good price, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant investment for me and shows my commitment to acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  This is a significant discount on its true value, and I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and with only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that further negotiation will get the price down to Bob's desired level. It's more efficient for Bob to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
