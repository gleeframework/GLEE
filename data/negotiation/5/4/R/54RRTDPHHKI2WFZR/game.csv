"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly far greater than that.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,450,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000.  This represents a fair price, allowing both of us to achieve a successful outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

This represents a significant investment for me and shows my commitment to acquiring this product.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
