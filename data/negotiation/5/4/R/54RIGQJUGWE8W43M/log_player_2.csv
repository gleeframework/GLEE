"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, so accepting the first offer is not the optimal strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to get the best possible deal.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still within my budget and leaves room for us to both come out ahead. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
