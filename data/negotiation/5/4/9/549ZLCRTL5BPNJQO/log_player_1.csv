Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

Since I know John is willing to pay $1,500,000, there's no incentive for me to offer Bob a lower price. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings, so I'll offer the product to Bob at the price I know it's worth to him.  He can either accept and we both get a good deal, or he can reject and I'll sell to John."
