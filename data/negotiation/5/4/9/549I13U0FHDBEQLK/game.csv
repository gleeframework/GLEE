"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, given my current needs. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you a profit.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
