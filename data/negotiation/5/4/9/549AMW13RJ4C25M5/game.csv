"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, and I do see its potential. However, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $750000 is lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $850000, which still reflects the significant value of this product. I believe this price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit too high.  Would you be willing to come down to $825000? I think this is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
