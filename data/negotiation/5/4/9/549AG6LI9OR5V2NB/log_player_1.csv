"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price close to the value Bob places on the product increases my chance of getting a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is still below Bob's maximum value, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Establishing a Strong Starting Point:**  This sets the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above my minimum threshold, it's significantly below my desired profit margin. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can secure a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding the ""Sell to John"" Scenario:** Selling to John would secure a guaranteed profit, but I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Highlighting the ""mutual benefit"":**  Emphasizing the shared benefit of closing the deal reinforces the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Keeping the offer close to my target:** This leaves room for further negotiation in future rounds if needed, but avoids a significant drop in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe is fair, considering the value to Bob.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  Accepting Bob's offer now would leave me with less bargaining power in the future.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate, and I can potentially reach a price closer to $900,000 with a counteroffer.

**Strategy for Next Round:** 

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, perhaps $890,000, to show flexibility while still working towards my target price. I'll emphasize the value of the product to Bob and the benefits of closing the deal at a price that's fair to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $890,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a small compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer, but not by a significant amount. This indicates I'm serious about closing the deal but also value the product.
* **Emphasizing ""fairness"":**  I'm reiterating that the offer is fair to both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency for a close:**  The phrase ""Let's close this deal"" implies a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards acceptance.

**Strategy for Next Rounds:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will be prepared to lower my offer again, but only slightly, perhaps to $885,000. I will continue to emphasize the benefits of closing the deal for both of us and the value the product holds for him.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a balance between staying firm on my price and securing a deal. If it becomes clear that we can't reach an agreement, I will be prepared to sell to John in the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $890,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, accepting his offer secures a good profit.
* **Avoiding further negotiations:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, and with John as a backup option, there's limited risk in accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time pressure:**  As the rounds are limited, it's crucial to maximize profit while ensuring a deal is reached. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

While I'm happy with the outcome, it's important to note that in the future, I might have considered a counteroffer at $885,000 to see if we could meet in the middle.  However, with the limited rounds and a good profit already secured, accepting Bob's offer was the most sensible choice."
