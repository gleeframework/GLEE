"Alice, your offer is way too high.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product. I hope you can meet me in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
