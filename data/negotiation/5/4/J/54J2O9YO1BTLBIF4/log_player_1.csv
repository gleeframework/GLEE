Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a fair compromise, as it's in the middle of our last two offers. Hopefully, Bob will accept this time!"
