"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get the product for less than $14,000. Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, and you're willing to pay up to $15,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $13,000, which is a fair compromise between my maximum price ($15,000) and Alice's minimum price ($12,000). This leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a slightly higher price, but it still gives me a significant discount from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is still lower than my maximum price of $15,000. While I'd prefer to get it for even less, it's a reasonable price and I don't want to risk Alice rejecting another counteroffer."
