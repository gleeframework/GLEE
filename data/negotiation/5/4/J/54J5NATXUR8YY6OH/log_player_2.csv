# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from Alice, and it's worth more to him than to Alice. It's in his best interest to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for less than what it's worth to him and less than what he'd pay John. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $11,200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great product with a lot of value, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While the price is getting closer to his desired price, he can still get it for a bit less, and it's worth trying to negotiate further.  He has the option to buy from John at $12,000, so there's room to push for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm feeling more confident about this deal, but $11,200 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000? I think we're both getting a good deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,200, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down to $11,100, which is a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and he'd be left with John as the only option. It's better to secure a good price now rather than risk a higher price later."
