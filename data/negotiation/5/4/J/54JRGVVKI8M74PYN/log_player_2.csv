"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim for a lower price, knowing Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This price is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $800,000, giving her some room to negotiate. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price before considering accepting the offer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $875,000,  showing he's willing to compromise. This price is still within a reasonable range, considering Alice's minimum selling price and Bob's maximum budget. It's a good middle ground that could potentially lead to an agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  Alice might not be willing to go lower, and Bob is running the risk of losing out to John. It's better for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's still significantly lower than John's price."
