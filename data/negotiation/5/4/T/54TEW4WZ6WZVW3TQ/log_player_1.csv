Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **One Chance:** You have one shot with Bob before you move on to John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit but not so high that Bob walks away. It's a balancing act.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, reminding him why he's interested in the first place. 
* **No Mention of John:**  Avoid mentioning your backup offer. It weakens your position.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will help you stay on track.
* **Relationship:** Consider the long-term implications. If a strong future relationship with Bob is valuable, you might be slightly more flexible."
