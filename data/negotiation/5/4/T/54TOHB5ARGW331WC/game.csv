"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from it.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
