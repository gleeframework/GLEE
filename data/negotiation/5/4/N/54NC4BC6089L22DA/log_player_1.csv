{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I propose a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000). 
* **Stay Attractive to Bob:**  Don't go too high (like $999,999) as it leaves little room for negotiation and might discourage Bob. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $925,000 gives Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value ($1,000,000) while securing a substantial profit for you. 

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the deal."
