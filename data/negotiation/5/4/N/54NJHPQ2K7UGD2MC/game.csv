"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $850,000.  It's a steal at this price, given its value.  I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be well worth it for you. Let me know your thoughts!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $775,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and a great opportunity for you. What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $775,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $762,500?  This is a fair middle ground that respects both of our needs.  I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you, and this price reflects that.",762500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $762,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $755,000? That's the best I can do.",755000.0,Bob,6,
