"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $15,000 to you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for it. This offer allows you to benefit from a significant discount compared to its market value while ensuring a fair profit for me. I believe this price is attractive and reasonable, given the value it brings to you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $14,000
* **Your maximum price:** $15,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and you ending up paying John's full price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
