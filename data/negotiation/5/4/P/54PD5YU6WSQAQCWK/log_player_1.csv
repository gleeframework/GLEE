Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth a shot. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a substantial profit for me (and still significantly below John's offer), while still leaving Bob with a potential $300,000 gain if he utilizes the product effectively.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before I go to John might incentivize Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
