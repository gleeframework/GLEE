"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a good starting point as it's above my minimum threshold but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $120. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $125. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
I'm sticking to my minimum price while still showing some flexibility.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will bridge the gap and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below $120. I'm not yet ready to sell for less than my minimum, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. How about we split the difference and go with $121? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product. "", ""product_price"": 121}
```

I'm offering a slight compromise at $121, just above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept and avoid needing to go through more rounds of negotiation."
