{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly below Alice's value for the product.  This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $150 maximum."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $125. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $125 is closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate and get closer to $110."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",

We're inching closer to a price acceptable to both parties. This offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. How about we split the difference and go with $121? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
