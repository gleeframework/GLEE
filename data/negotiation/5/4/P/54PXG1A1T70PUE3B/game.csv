"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's something that can truly help you achieve your goals. I'm confident it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. I'm asking for $1,100,000. This gives you a significant advantage while still ensuring a great return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
