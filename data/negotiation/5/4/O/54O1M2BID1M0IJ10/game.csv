"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $850,000 doesn't fully reflect that. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering its potential worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for you. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
