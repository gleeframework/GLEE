"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product, and Alice is willing to sell it for at least $80.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the first offer gives you the opportunity to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to let it go for $85 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point. It's better to keep negotiating and see if you can get closer to your target of $85.  You still have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $88?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $89.50. This is my final concession, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her original asking price, and this offer is very close to your desired price of $85. You have only 5 rounds remaining, and there's a good chance you could end up paying John $100 if you keep negotiating. It's a good deal for you and you are likely to get a better price than what John is offering."
