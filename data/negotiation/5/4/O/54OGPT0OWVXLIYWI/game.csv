"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $1050000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1150000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1100000, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counteroffer at $1120000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price!",1120000.0,Alice,5,
