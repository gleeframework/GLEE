"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my finances. Can we meet in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $8000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $10000. That's a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle. ",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to propose an offer of $8500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Can you consider this offer?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While $8500 is a bit lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $9500? That's a good middle ground, and I think it reflects the value of the product fairly. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,6,
