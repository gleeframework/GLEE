"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what you're willing to pay and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. You can then see if Alice will counter-offer with a lower price, getting you closer to her value of $80."
