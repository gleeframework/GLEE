"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($120), hoping to get closer to my ideal selling point.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is still above my minimum price but closer to what Bob is willing to pay.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains a fair price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to sell, I'm going to reject and try to get a better price. I have a guaranteed sale with John for $120, so I'm not desperate to take a lower price.  I'll counter with something closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115, which is closer to my minimum but still gives Bob a chance to negotiate. I'm hoping that by this point, Bob will realize I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John.  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's more worthwhile to sell to John and guarantee a price that meets my minimum needs."
