"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $120 is still a bit much for my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $100 for the product. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little, but $90 is still a tad high for me. How about we settle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $80, Bob. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $110. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,7,
