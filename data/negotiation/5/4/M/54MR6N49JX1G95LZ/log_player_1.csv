Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is very close to my desired price of $1,000,000 and it's a good deal considering I'm only 4 rounds into the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing this deal by pushing for more."
