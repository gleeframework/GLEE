"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a significant discount from your original offer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. How about $1350000? This would still be a significant saving for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1300000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
