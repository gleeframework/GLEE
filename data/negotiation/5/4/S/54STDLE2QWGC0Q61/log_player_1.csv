"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $120, but it allows room for negotiation and potentially a good profit.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. Bob clearly values the product, but I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer to $160. This is still a good profit for me, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is fair considering Bob's counteroffer and my initial asking price.  Let's see if this gets us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $140 is a decent profit for me.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure a solid profit now than to gamble on a higher price that may never materialize."
