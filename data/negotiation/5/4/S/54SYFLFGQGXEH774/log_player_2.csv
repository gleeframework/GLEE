Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget in mind, but $10,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the value you place on the product is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That seems like a fair deal considering it's the maximum I value the product at."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already accepted a lower offer from another buyer, John, for $15,000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to match his offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll give you a slight discount to $14,500, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing.  We know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000 because that's our fallback option. It's highly unlikely John would simultaneously be offering Alice $15,000 for the same product. Alice is trying to pressure us into a higher price.  We should take the guaranteed deal with John."
