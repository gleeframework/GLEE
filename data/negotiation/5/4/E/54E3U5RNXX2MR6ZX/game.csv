"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $1450000 at this time.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1550000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1675000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value and uniqueness.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
