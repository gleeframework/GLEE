Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 130}
```
This is a starting point. Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $100 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
While $100 is above Alice's minimum, it's a significant drop from the initial offer. Rejecting and countering keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a very competitive price for this item."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Showing a willingness to compromise keeps Bob engaged. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Re-emphasizing the ""competitive price"" reinforces the product's worth.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $115 is still a significant profit margin for Alice, while leaving room for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
