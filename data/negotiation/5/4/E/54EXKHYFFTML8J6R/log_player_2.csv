{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a low offer of $100.  This is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay up to $120, and I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm increasing my offer to $115. This is a compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to close the deal with Alice, but I'm also aware that I can always buy from John if we can't agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than I'm willing to pay, but we're getting closer. I'll continue to negotiate and hopefully reach a compromise that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm making my final offer of $120. This is my absolute maximum, as I'm willing to buy from John for that price. I hope Alice understands that this is a fair price for both of us."
