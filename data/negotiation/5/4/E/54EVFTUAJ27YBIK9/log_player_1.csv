"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'm confident the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low.  I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's close enough to his value that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. $750,000 is close, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my target price. $825,000 is a solid offer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal. Bob seems unwilling to budge, and the risk of getting stuck with a lower price is growing.  John is offering a guaranteed $800,000, which aligns with my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell to John."
