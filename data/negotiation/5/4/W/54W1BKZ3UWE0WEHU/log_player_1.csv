"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start significantly above Bob's perceived value but below our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""potential,"" subtly suggesting that Bob might be undervaluing it. 
* **Alternative:** We keep the John option in mind. If negotiations stall or Bob's offers are too low, we can walk away and secure the $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably below our minimum acceptable price and even further from our initial offer.  We have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. We'll aim to bring Bob closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** We're signaling flexibility by dropping $100,000 from our initial offer. This makes our concession seem significant while still keeping the price well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Framing:** We continue to emphasize the product's value.  By saying ""meet in the middle,"" we're implying $1,000,000 is a fair compromise, even though it's closer to our starting point than his.
* **Time Consideration:** We still have plenty of rounds. This allows us to make smaller concessions early on and gauge Bob's reactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer only increased by $50,000, indicating he's trying to move slowly towards a price that's still significantly below our minimum. 
* **Leverage Time:**  We have six rounds left. This allows us to push back firmly now and encourage larger concessions from Bob in subsequent rounds. 
* **John Option:** We should keep the guaranteed $1,200,000 in mind as a viable alternative if Bob's offers don't improve significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $975,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stand:** We're making a relatively small concession ($25,000), signaling that we're reaching our lower limit. This creates a sense of urgency and puts the onus on Bob to make a more substantial move.
* **""Lowest I'll Go"":** This phrasing is a strong tactic to convey a sense of finality. While we might be willing to negotiate slightly further, presenting this as a firm bottom line might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk Bob might walk away. However, by taking a firm stance, we're more likely to reach a price closer to our target, even if it takes a few more rounds. 
* **John Backup:** We haven't forgotten about John.  If Bob rejects this offer or makes minimal counteroffers, selling to John becomes an increasingly attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is a step backward after we gave a firm ""lowest price"" of $975,000. This suggests he's unwilling to meet our minimum requirement.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only four rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob significantly increasing his offer is low.  Continuing negotiations would likely involve further concessions on our end for a minimal potential gain.
* **Guaranteed Return:** John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000. This is substantially more than what Bob is currently willing to pay and guarantees we achieve our minimum desired outcome. 

**It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the favorable deal with John.**"
