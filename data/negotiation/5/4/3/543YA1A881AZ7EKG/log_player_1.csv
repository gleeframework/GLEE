Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $8,000, so I'm not willing to go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, and it's close enough to my minimum value. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation."
