I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. If he rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$9,000 is too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer but still lower than my original $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is still a good profit for me and I'm hoping it's more appealing to Bob while still showing I'm not willing to settle for his low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 less than what I can get from John. It's worth it to close the deal with Bob rather than risk another counteroffer and potentially end up with nothing."
