Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he's willing to pay. I'll adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my initial ask. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but  $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $8,750 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a very fair price considering the value of this product.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still committed to buying this product from you, but $9000 is simply not within my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8750.  If that doesn't work for you, I will have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is firm on his offer and has shown willingness to walk away if I don't accept.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,750 is still a good deal and above my minimum threshold. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
