"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for a product of this quality.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but  $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750.  This is my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $8750 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? This is a very fair price considering the value of this product.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still committed to buying this product from you, but $9000 is simply not within my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8750.  If that doesn't work for you, I will have to consider other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,
