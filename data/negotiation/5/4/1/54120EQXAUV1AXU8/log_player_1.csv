"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working towards a compromise, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,250, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
