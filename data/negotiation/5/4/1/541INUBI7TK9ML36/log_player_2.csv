{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget. This will hopefully prompt Alice to negotiate seriously and potentially come closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my maximum budget. While it's closer, I'm still hoping to save more. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This is still within my budget, and it shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price limit. It should be a good middle ground to potentially reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, I still want to try to get a better price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going for a final counteroffer at $1,225,000. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's last offer and my maximum budget. This is my final offer before I'm willing to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than my maximum budget and even higher than her previous offer. It seems she's not willing to negotiate further.  Since John is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is within my budget, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John."
