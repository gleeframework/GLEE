"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a fair price for you, but I still need to consider my own profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1350000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1300000, which would still be a profitable deal for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1320000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
