Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to give you a better deal, though. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much closer to your ideal price. It's better to secure the product at $80 from John than risk further negotiation with Alice."
