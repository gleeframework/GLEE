"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while still leaving some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1400000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant compromise from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1500000. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
