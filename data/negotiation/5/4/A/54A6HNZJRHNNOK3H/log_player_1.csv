Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, and you have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, it's strategically wise to start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and your willingness to offer a deal before going public. This might make Bob consider the offer more seriously. 
* **Negotiation Buffer:** If Bob rejects the initial price, you can always negotiate down, potentially settling at a price higher than $15,000.  

By starting high, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob without jeopardizing the sale to John."
