"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to own something that's worth $15000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum budget, it still leaves a significant profit margin for Alice. 
* **You have 9 rounds left.** This allows for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is not the best option.** It's a safety net, but you can likely get a better deal.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves a decent profit margin for her.
