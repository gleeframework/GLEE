"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $82 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still not comfortable with the price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $80? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",80.0,Alice,5,
