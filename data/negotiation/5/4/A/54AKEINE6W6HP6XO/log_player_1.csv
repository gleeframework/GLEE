"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as much as possible.  This is a risky strategy, but it might lead to a higher final price if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his offer.  I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal, but I want to avoid pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  It's closer to my desired price, but I still think I can get a bit more.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm optimistic that I can close a deal with Bob at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,000. This is a compromise between his last offer and my previous one. I hope this will encourage Bob to make a final move towards my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,750 is very close to my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure this deal now than to risk getting a lower price from John or missing out on a sale altogether."
