"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the product's value is still negotiable. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand where you're coming from.  However, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I believe the product's true value is.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  I'd be willing to agree to $900,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to offer $880,000, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me.",880000.0,Bob,6,
