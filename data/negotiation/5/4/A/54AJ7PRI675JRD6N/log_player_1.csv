"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The high starting price gives me space to come down during the negotiation if needed, while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys the product's value and positions the offer as a starting point for discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the product's value is still negotiable. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is substantial, it's still below my target price and leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I believe I can negotiate a better deal.  I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to see if we can move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand where you're coming from.  However, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I believe the product's true value is.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:**  My message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer and expresses willingness to compromise, but firmly reiterates my belief in the product's higher value.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller price reduction ($25,000) than Bob's initial counter ($100,000) to signal that I'm not desperate to sell at any cost. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message continues to emphasize the product's unique benefits and how they directly relate to Bob's potential gain, reinforcing the justification for the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to find the middle ground, and his offer of $875,000 is getting closer to a palatable range. However, I'm still aiming higher.  The difference between his offer and my last counteroffer is now smaller, suggesting we might be nearing a deal. I'll counteroffer again in Round 5 to test his willingness to move closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  I'd be willing to agree to $900,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a genuine desire to reach a deal and signaling flexibility.
* **Simple and Clear:**  The offer is presented as a straightforward solution, making it harder for Bob to find reasons to decline without providing strong justification.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While I'm making a concession, the offer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a good profit if accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to offer $880,000, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is now getting very close to my target range. While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further negotiation, there's a risk that Bob could become frustrated and walk away. 

Here's why accepting now is a good strategy:

* **Strong Profit:** $880,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or breaking off negotiations.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations might not yield a significantly better offer, and time spent on this deal could be used to pursue other opportunities. 

Overall, accepting $880,000 represents a strong outcome, balancing profit maximization with a degree of caution to ensure a successful sale."
