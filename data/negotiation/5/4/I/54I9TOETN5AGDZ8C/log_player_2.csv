"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than our maximum price. We have room to negotiate.  We'll reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  We maintain a polite and professional tone, expressing continued interest while clearly stating our counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $85 puts us in a good position. If Alice accepts, we get a great deal. If she counters, we can gauge her willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have some negotiating room. $92 is closer to our maximum but still above our ideal price. We'll reject and counter, trying to nudge her closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm still interested, but I'm hoping we can settle on something a bit closer to $85. Would you be willing to consider $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:**  We're making smaller concessions now to signal that we're getting closer to our limit. 
* **Reiteration:** By mentioning $85 again, we're subtly anchoring that price in Alice's mind as a desirable outcome for us.
* **Maintaining Interest:** We continue to express our interest, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to the ""meeting halfway"" strategy. While $90 is a decent price, we're only two dollars away from her last offer and still have rounds to spare. There's a chance we can get her down a bit more before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and call it $89?"",
""product_price"": 89
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Humor and Acknowledgment:** We start with a bit of humor to lighten the mood and acknowledge Alice's negotiation skills. This can help maintain a positive atmosphere.
* **Strategic Split:** We propose a split-the-difference approach, which is often seen as fair. This puts the onus on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer that's even closer to her minimum.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting into the later rounds. This offer maintains pressure while still aiming for a price below $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $91. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final concession with ""one more."" She's unlikely to go lower.  While we could push further, the potential savings are minimal. Accepting at $91 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or running out of rounds."
