"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better deal, even if it means walking away with John's $100 option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's initial price ($110). This sets a low anchor and gives us room for negotiation.
* **Show Interest:** We express interest in the product but make it clear that the current price is unacceptable.
* **Leave Room:** By offering $80, we leave space for Alice to counter-offer and potentially meet us somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $95 is still above our ideal target. We're aiming for under $100, and John's offer is already at that threshold. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before considering John's offer or accepting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $85? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make a deal right now if you're happy with it."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** We're moving closer to Alice's price but not dramatically. Splitting the difference between her last offer ($95) and our previous one ($80) would be $87.50. We're offering $85 to see if she's willing to go slightly below a perfect split.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're adding a touch of urgency by implying we're ready to close the deal immediately at this price. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We want to keep the negotiation amicable and appreciative to encourage Alice to continue working with us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down to $90, which is a $20 discount from her initial price and a $10 savings compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Investment:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating. While we might squeeze out a few more dollars, it's not guaranteed, and further haggling could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Meeting Our Goal:**  Our goal was to get the product for under $100, and we've achieved that. 
 
It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the deal."
