"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Value:** I'm aiming for a price closer to $150, as that's the product's value to Bob.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even though $130 is higher than my minimum, there's still room to push for a better price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that even at $135, it's a good deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The ""meeting in the middle"" phrasing implies fairness and encourages Bob to accept."
