"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $140 is above Bob's maximum price of $150.
* It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to negotiate a lower price, starting with a significant drop from Alice's offer. 
* $130 is still above Alice's minimum of $120, giving her room to potentially accept.
* It's a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $135 is within Bob's budget of $150. 
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, potentially leading to a situation where Bob has to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting the offer at $135 ensures Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's, and saves time and potential frustration with further negotiation."
