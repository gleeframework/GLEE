Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave some room for negotiation. This should make him consider the offer seriously.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly but firm, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away too much value in the first round."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. 
* **I'm not willing to sell to John yet.** I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob. I'll counteroffer to see if I can reach a compromise closer to my target.
* **Rejection allows me to retain control of the negotiation.** It also sends a signal to Bob that I'm serious about my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a different perspective on the value, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.

```

* **Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and the gap is still significant. 
* **I'm not willing to sell to John yet.**  I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before resorting to that. I still believe there's a chance I can get a better deal.
* **Rejection allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and show Bob that I'm serious about my asking price.** I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can push him closer to my desired price.  I'll need to be strategic with my next counteroffer to try and close the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your perspective. However, $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me to sell.  I'm willing to make a final concession, but this is it. I'm offering the product for $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both recognize, and it allows us to close this deal.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's last offer, but it's still within my minimum acceptable range. It demonstrates my flexibility, but also signals that this is my final offer.
* **Message:** I'm using a more assertive tone, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the need to reach a decision. I'm  clearly indicating that this is my final offer, creating pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Strategy:** This is a high-stakes counteroffer.  I'm essentially saying ""take it or leave it.""  If Bob rejects, I might need to move on to John, but I'm hoping the pressure will encourage him to accept, as it's a fair price considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,075,000. I'm willing to pay $1,030,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **We're down to the wire:**  With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is getting risky.  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is high:**  There's a chance Bob will reject my next offer, and I'll be left with a small window to sell to John.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:**  While it's not my ideal outcome, it guarantees I get my minimum acceptable value. It's better to have a guaranteed sale than to risk losing out on a better deal with Bob. 

I'm willing to walk away from this negotiation to secure a sale that meets my needs."
