Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob. This is to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** This offer aims to get the highest price possible while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to confidently negotiate with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 alternative. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm prepared to consider counteroffers and adjust my price accordingly, always keeping my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 in mind."
