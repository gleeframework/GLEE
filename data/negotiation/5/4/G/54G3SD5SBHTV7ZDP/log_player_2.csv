"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice is offering the product for $95.
* You can get the product from John for $120.

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would cost you more, but it's still within your budget. However, rejecting Alice's offer allows for the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or finding another seller with a better deal."
