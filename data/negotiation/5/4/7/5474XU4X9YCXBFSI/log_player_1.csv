Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $15,000.  Offering it at $14,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin while still being attractive enough for Bob to likely accept.
* **Time Value of Money:** While you have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, closing the deal with Bob quickly means you get the money faster. 
* **""Take it or Leave it"" Approach:** This creates a sense of urgency and avoids potential back-and-forth negotiations that could lower your final price."
