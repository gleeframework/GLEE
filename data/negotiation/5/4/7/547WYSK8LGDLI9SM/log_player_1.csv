Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($100) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $95 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a good price if he accepts immediately. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** I have the security of John's offer ($80), so I can be firmer in negotiations with Bob, knowing I won't be left empty-handed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share it. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a decent offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than my fallback option (John's $80 offer).  I'll aim for a price closer to $90 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I value this product highly. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations forward.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** $90 is a price I'm comfortable with, as it provides a good profit margin over my alternative ($80 from John). 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how serious Bob is about the product and how much he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $87 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, signaling he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $87 is a solid profit, significantly more than John's $80 offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with nothing."
