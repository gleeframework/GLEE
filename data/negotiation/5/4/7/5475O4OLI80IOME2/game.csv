"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we settle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
