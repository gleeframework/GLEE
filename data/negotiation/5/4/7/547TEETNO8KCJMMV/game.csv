"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
