"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a bit higher than its market value, but it's a unique piece with a lot of potential. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its actual value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference at $15,000? That's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I truly believe it's the best price we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,000.  That's the final price I'm willing to accept.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
