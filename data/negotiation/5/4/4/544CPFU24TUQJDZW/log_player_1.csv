"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but not too outrageous. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, and also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with him in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and leaves some room for further negotiation.  I think this offer is fair and reasonable, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can convince Bob to meet me halfway with a counteroffer.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to stick with $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best price I can get from Bob at this point.  If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, but I'm still hoping we can come to an agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $820,000 is getting very close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident that I can convince Bob to meet me halfway. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 835000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $835,000. This is a small concession from my last offer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise.  With only a few rounds left, I want to see if we can reach a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $815,000 is only $15,000 away from my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. We're down to the final two rounds, so the pressure is on. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at $825,000. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John.  It's a tough call, but I'm still hoping for a deal with Bob."

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. I'm only $10,000 away from my minimum price, but there's no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer in the final round. To ensure I don't walk away with nothing, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still a significant amount of money and ensures a sale."
