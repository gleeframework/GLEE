{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, so I'm asking for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm asking for a price that's higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob away. I'm also being optimistic and highlighting the value of the product. 

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm emphasizing the product's value to see if I can convince him to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $112.50. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $112.50 is closer to my desired price and still above my minimum. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for the minimum price."
