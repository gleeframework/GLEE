Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $150 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being above your minimum value of $100.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and makes it easier for him to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, you've successfully sold the product for a good price!
* If Bob rejects the offer, analyze his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth accepting or if you should make a counteroffer of your own.  
* If the negotiation stalls or you feel the price is too low, you can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** You've stated that the product is worth no less than $100 to you. Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum, but it's not a great price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to propose a counteroffer that's more in line with your desired price. 

**Next step:** You will make a counteroffer to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price.
* **Reasoning:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, making it seem more reasonable and less arbitrary. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the chance of reaching an agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, you've successfully sold the product for a price you're happy with.
* If Bob rejects the offer, you'll need to analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle. Would $135 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is very close to your minimum price of $100. While it's not ideal, it's still a profitable sale.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away from the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer:** While you can always sell to John for $100, Bob's offer is still $35 better.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation. It secures a sale at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
