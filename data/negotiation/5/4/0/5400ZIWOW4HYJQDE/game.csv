"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the price under $15,000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a fair price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
