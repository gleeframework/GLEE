"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $79.50. Can you consider my revised offer?",79.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. How about $80.50? That's only a dollar more than your offer, and it would be a good compromise.",80.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $80.50. I'm willing to go up to $79.00, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
