"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in your product but can only offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling my strong interest in the product while establishing my budget limits. 
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a clear reason for the lower offer helps build a sense of  fairness and encourages Alice to consider a counter-counteroffer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $900,000 leaves room for potential compromise and a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering you the product for $1200000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the product's true value and provides you with a significant opportunity.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can find a price closer to my $900,000 offer.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,050,000.  This offer reflects a fair price for the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer shows a willingness to compromise and meet halfway.

* **Reiterating Value:**  Reminding Alice of the benefit to both parties reinforces the win-win aspect of the deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm offering you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within your budget.  Let's close this deal and move forward.

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but $1,100,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,100,000 is still just a bit outside my budget.  To make this deal happen, I'm offering you $1,075,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize this deal.  Let's close this agreement now."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** Offering $1,075,000 demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still remaining within my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and helps us both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeated her previous offer of $1,100,000, indicating she may be unwilling to budge further.  While I'm close to my target, I've already reached the point where the price difference is minimal, and continuing the negotiation risks going over my budget.  It's more prudent to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring a deal within my budget."
