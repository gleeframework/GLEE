Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is my maximum price, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $2,000,000 represents a significant discount on its true value and potential. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits this product can bring to your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. While I appreciate the lower price, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my side.  I hope we can reach a deal before time runs out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and accepting his offer nets a profit above his initial offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him in later rounds."
