"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for return on your investment.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is my maximum price, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $2,000,000 represents a significant discount on its true value and potential. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits this product can bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. While I appreciate the lower price, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my side.  I hope we can reach a deal before time runs out.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
