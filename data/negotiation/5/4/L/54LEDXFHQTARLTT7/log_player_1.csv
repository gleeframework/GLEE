"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I believe I can get a better price from Bob, or potentially from John if I have to.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and hopefully we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is a good price, considering that I can get $1,000,000 from John.  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting a bit risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as I might not have time to reach a better deal before having to sell to John."
