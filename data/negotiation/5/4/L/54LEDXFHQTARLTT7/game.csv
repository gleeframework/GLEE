"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and hopefully we can close this quickly.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
