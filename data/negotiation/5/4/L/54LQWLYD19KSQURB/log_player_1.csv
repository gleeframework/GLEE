Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring we get more than our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""special price,"" we subtly imply the offer might not last, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might try to negotiate further, or he might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives us the best chance of maximizing profit while having a backup plan (selling to John)."
