"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to me. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,500? That's the highest I can go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
