Bob's offer:

While $1,600,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your constraints.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,350,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his current offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely we'll bridge that gap quickly enough to warrant passing on John's guaranteed offer."
