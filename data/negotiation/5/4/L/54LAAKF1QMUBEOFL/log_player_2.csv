"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I believe a mutually beneficial agreement is possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is way over Bob's budget, and he can get the product for a much lower price from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as she might be willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob.  While $1,600,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your constraints.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price still reflects the significant value this product brings.

While $1,350,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. He can secure the product from John for a much lower price, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
