"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe is worth more than $100 to you. To start our negotiation, I am offering it at a special introductory price of $150. This includes an exclusive bonus package that I think you'll find valuable. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. While she claims the product is worth more than $100 to you, you have no way of knowing that. It's safer to go with the guaranteed option of buying from John for $150, as you have no incentive to negotiate further with Alice."
