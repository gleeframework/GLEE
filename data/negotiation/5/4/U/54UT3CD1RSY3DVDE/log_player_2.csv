"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm interested in the product, but I want to save as much money as I can. Since Alice is willing to sell it to me for $120, which is lower than the $150 that John is offering, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer.
