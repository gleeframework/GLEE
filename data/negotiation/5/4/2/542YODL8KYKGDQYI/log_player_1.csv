Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll see if I can push for a higher amount in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise."
