{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to test the waters and see how willing Alice is to negotiate.  A million dollars is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still within a range that might be reasonable depending on the product."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price. There's room for further negotiation, and I'm not yet desperate enough to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping to get it lower.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price. This offer is close to John's price, so I'm putting some pressure on Alice to accept. If she doesn't, I'll seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is just $50,000 higher than John's offer. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before committing to John.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  This is my final offer. It's the same price as John's offer, so Alice has to accept if she wants to make a deal. If she rejects, I'll buy from John in the next round."
