"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,500. This is the absolute most I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
