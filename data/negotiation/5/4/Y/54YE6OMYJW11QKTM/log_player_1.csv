Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think I can agree on a price of $150 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, I know John is guaranteed to buy it at that price. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob when I have a sure sale at my minimum acceptable price."
