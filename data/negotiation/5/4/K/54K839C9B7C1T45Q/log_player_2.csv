"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 and Alice is offering the product at $1,000,000, there is no advantage in accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to consider other potential sellers or negotiate a better price with Alice later."
