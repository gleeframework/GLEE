{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing our safety net is $12,000 from John.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Offering it at $10,000 gives Bob a $2,000 discount (very enticing) while giving you a $2,000 profit over your minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning listing it publicly, we create a sense of urgency and make the offer feel more exclusive. 
 
This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
