Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is the highest amount I am comfortable spending on this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm not yet in a desperate position to accept a lower price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $1,600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,625,000. I believe this price strikes a good balance between what I can afford and the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I want to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely. $1,625,000 is a good compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
