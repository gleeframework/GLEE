Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and this is a chance to own it at a price below its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. It's unlikely he'll accept the first offer without some back and forth.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

By offering a price slightly below John's offer, Alice increases her chances of getting a better price from Bob while still having the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
