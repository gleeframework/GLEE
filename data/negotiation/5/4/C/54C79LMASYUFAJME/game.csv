"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9500.  This is a fair price, and it's the most I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10500 as a final compromise.  Let's make this happen. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $10000.  Would you consider $10000 as a final price?  This is the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,6,
