"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits from owning it.",650000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I agree the product is valuable, $650,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $550,000 for it.  What do you think?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $550,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, while also showing my willingness to work with you to reach an agreement.",600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $575,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering our previous discussions and the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",575000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not convinced that $575,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering the value it brings to the table, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $585,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement.",585000.0,Alice,5,
