"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits from owning it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price.  While $650,000 is a good deal, there's room for improvement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $550,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, while also showing my willingness to work with you to reach an agreement.

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not convinced that $575,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering the value it brings to the table, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $585,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement.

Alice has come down significantly, and while I'd prefer to get it for my initial target price of $550,000, $585,000 is a good deal. It's less than half of what John is selling it for, and it's a good compromise. I'm going to accept her offer."
