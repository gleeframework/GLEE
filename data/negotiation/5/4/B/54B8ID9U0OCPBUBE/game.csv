"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its features and market value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can justify.  Let's split the difference and settle on $15,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
