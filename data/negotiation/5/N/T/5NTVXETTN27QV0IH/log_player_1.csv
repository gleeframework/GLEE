"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation but is significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $80. I believe this will be a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to engage and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $100 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's fair for both of us. I believe this price is reasonable, considering Bob's willingness to pay $100 and my minimum threshold of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105. While it's still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's a reasonable compromise and significantly higher than selling to John.  This ensures I get a decent profit and avoids further negotiation rounds that may lead to a lower price."
