"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Aggressive Approach:**  I'm aiming to get as much as possible in the initial offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and helps set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum desired price, I'm confident I can get a better deal.
* **I have more room to negotiate.** With 8 rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and try to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  If the negotiations with Bob fall apart, I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Counter:**  I'm lowering my price, showing flexibility, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a collaborative approach to encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I can still do better. 
* **More Room for Negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left, so I'm not pressured to accept this offer yet.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Even if Bob continues to reject my offers, I have a solid alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I frame the price as a ""fair"" compromise to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency Implied:**  I subtly suggest that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to take the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Going Lower:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting very close to my minimum, but there's a high chance that he'll keep lowering the price, potentially below my acceptable range.
* **Time Pressure:** We're down to 4 rounds. If I continue negotiating with Bob, there's a risk of not being able to reach a deal before the 10 rounds are over.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $1,500,000. 

Even though Bob might be willing to pay more in future rounds, the risk of him rejecting further offers and ending up with nothing is too high. It's more secure to take the guaranteed profit from John."
