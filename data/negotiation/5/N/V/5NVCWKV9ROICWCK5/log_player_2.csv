"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can save $500 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You can afford to go through a few rounds of negotiation to try and get a better price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $11,000, which is still a good price for me, as it saves me $1,000 compared to John's price. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that Alice might accept, given that she values the product at $10,000."
