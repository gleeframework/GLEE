"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  $95 is still a decent price, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.  It's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a price closer to her desired $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There are still rounds left, and Bob can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to rush into a deal when there's potential to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $90 is still a good deal for him and closer to Alice's desired price, making her more likely to accept. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, and the price is still higher than Bob's ideal. There are still rounds left, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before considering the offer. The goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a good deal for him and closer to Alice's desired price, making her more likely to accept.  It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in this round, given the dwindling rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, Alice is not willing to budge much.  The price is getting closer to the price John is offering, and the risk of further negotiation failing is high. Buying from John provides a guaranteed price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
