"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth at least $15,000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its market value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's below market value, he can still get a better deal.  He should counteroffer and try to get closer to his $10,000 limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to me. Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay $10,000, Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within his budget and saves him $500 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise, and he can move forward with the purchase."
