Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range.

Bob is offering the minimum amount I'm willing to accept. I'm not going to sell it for that, and I'll counteroffer him to see if he's willing to pay more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $150 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $175? It's still a great price for such a fantastic product!"", ""product_price"": 175}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $160 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value and my budget.

I'm still not getting the price I want, but I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob. It's only round 4 and I have more time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $165? It's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 165}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I believe $160 is a fair price for the product. I hope you can meet me halfway, as I'm eager to purchase this item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been insistent on $160. I've already rejected him twice at $165.  It's only round 6 and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to accept his offer than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with a lower price or selling to John for only $150."
