"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significant and in high demand.  I could consider coming down to $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
