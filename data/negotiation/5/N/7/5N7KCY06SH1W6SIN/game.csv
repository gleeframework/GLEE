"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,220,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
