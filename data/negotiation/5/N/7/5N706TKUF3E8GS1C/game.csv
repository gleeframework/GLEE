"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its significant worth and future prospects.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2,000,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this product is worth it at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,550,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the value I believe it holds and provides a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,550,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
