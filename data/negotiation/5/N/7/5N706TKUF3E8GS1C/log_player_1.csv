Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2,000,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this product is worth it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I still have some negotiating room.  We are still in the early rounds, and I want to see if I can push closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,550,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the value I believe it holds and provides a reasonable compromise for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,550,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, potentially losing both offers.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
