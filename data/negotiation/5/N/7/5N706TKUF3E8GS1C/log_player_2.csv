"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its significant worth and future prospects. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer. $2,000,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2,000,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,750,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this product is worth it at this price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,550,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the value I believe it holds and provides a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,550,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,450,000.
