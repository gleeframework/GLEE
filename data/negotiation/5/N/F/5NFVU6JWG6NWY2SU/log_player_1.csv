Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm framing the message in a way that highlights the potential value to Bob while also emphasizing that it's a fair price for me. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm starting high, aiming to get as much as possible.
* **Keep Bob engaged:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Protect my minimum:**  The offer is still significantly higher than my fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is still better than selling to John, it's significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still below my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while also aiming for a better price.
* **Focus on value:**  I remind Bob that $13,000 is still a good deal for him, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to discussion:**  I keep the message open-ended to encourage further negotiation and a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a fair compromise. It's higher than selling to John and is closer to my initial desired price.  At this point, continuing the negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price, and risking losing the deal altogether doesn't seem worth it."
