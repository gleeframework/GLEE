"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
