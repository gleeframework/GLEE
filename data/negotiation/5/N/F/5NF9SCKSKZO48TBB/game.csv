"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. This is a fair offer considering the current market and my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $790,000. This is my absolute limit based on my budget constraints. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  If you're unable to accept this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",790000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $790,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $790,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $820,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reflects the product's value. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Alice,7,
