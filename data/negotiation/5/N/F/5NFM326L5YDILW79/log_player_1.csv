Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $150 yet, as I need to make at least $150 profit. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $150 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer for $160. This is above my minimum price of $150, and while I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to close the deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
