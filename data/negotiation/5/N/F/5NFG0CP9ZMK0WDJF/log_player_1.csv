Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $100. Offering it at $90 allows me to maximize my profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is my target, starting a bit higher leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Sale:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $80 from John, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to confidently aim for a higher price with Bob."
