Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $7,500}

This is a reasonable offer, as it's still below the product's value to Bob, but gives me a decent profit margin. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $7,000. Since this is still below the product's value to him, I'll consider making a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

However, I also have the option to sell the product to John for $8,000, which is the product's true value. Since I'm not sure if Bob will make a better offer, I'll choose to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $8,000, as it's the best option for me at this point."
