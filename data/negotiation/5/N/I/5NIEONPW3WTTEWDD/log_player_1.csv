"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for me. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise and engage with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to see if Bob is willing to come up, as I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and John is waiting in the wings with a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer. I need to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is a great price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
