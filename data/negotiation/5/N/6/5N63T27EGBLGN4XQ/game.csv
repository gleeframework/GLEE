"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing progress in our discussions, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,375,000. This represents a significant move on my end while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
