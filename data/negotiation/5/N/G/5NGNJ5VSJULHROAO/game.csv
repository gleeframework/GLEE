,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $775,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
