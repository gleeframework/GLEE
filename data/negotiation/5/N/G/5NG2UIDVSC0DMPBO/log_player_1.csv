"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the minimum amount I want for the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price.  Since I'm already at my minimum, there's no benefit in risking a lower price."
