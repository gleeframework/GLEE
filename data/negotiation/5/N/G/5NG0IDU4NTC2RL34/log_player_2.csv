# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $8,750. I'll sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for this amazing product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $9,000.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob initially wanted a lower price, Alice has already met him halfway, and further negotiation might be time-consuming. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** If Bob rejects this offer, he could end up buying from John at $12,000.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 is the best option for Bob, as it saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John and is a fair price given the negotiations."
