"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's still a great deal for you.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
