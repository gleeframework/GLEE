Round 3

$165 is still too high. I'm willing to go a little higher but not that much. I'll counter with a lower offer to try and get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $165 is still too high for me.  How about $145? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
