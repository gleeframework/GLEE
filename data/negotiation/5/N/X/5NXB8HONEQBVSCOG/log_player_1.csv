Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $900,000, Bob still gets a good deal, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room to lower the price if necessary without going below your minimum acceptable value.
* **It sets a clear expectation:**  The message communicates your willingness to negotiate, but also establishes a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $850,000 for this purchase. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $860,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll continue to be stuck in a stalemate. I'm confident in the value of my product and have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum.  It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with less."
