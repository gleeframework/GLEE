Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be of great value to you."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $100. 
* **John's Offer:** Your backup offer from John is $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value.
* **Highly Profitable for You:**  It's well above your minimum acceptable price and John's offer.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
