"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it.  I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is halfway between my minimum ($120) and what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80).  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price.  I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This is a great price for such a fantastic product!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $95. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit. The message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I think $90 would be a fair price for the product considering my budget. Could you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, I'm starting to run out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal completely. $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price and a good result given the circumstances."
