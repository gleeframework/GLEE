``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal."
