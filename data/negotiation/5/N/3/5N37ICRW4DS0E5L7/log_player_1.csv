Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value.  This allows some room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, as Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's room for both of us to benefit from a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me. This is a strategic move to show flexibility and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I still want to make a deal with him, the risk of further negotiations going down is too high. I'm confident that John's offer is a more secure way to reach my minimum acceptable value."
