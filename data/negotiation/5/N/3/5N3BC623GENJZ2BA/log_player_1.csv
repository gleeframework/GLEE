Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to negotiate and potentially agree on a price that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage a positive interaction and build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $100, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is the lowest I can go.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $95 to $90.
* **Still above minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the deal he's getting.
* **Closing statement:** I'm using a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, so I'd like to offer $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance we'll get stuck in a back-and-forth that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

Since John offers a higher price and there's a risk of further negotiation with Bob, it's more advantageous to sell to John and guarantee my minimum profit."
