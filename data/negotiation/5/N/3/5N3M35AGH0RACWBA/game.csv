"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $108 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $106.  Let's try to close this deal.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $107. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. Let's make a deal!",107.0,Alice,5,
