"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $13,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a good value for you, and it's closer to my price point. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000. Can you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your offer.  To be honest, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but this is really my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable price. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
