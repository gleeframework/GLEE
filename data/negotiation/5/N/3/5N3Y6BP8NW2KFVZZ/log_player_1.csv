Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm looking for at least $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'd like to propose a price of $8,500 to make the deal more appealing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.  I'll see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $8,600 to try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. While $8,600 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. If Bob doesn't budge, I can always sell to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $8,700.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}
