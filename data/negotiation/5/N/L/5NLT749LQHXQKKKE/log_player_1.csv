This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to $120 as possible while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
