{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, while also ensuring you're still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with selling below my minimum. I'm confident John will be happy to buy the product at my price, so I'm going to sell to him."
