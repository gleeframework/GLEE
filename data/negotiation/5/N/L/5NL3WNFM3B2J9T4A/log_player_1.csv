"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged.
* **Value Proposition:**  I subtly remind Bob of the value the product holds for him, making it a seemingly good deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I want to get.  
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a Last Resort:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, but I'm optimistic that I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit.
* **Positive Language:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation going.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize finding a solution that benefits both of us, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.
* **Negotiation Signal:** By offering a lower price, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $9500. How about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasonable Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my target price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be realistic. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit and avoids the possibility of losing the deal entirely."
