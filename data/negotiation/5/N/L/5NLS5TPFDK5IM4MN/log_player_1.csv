{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This makes it appealing to Bob while still being profitable for you.

I'm choosing to start with a strong initial offer. This will allow me to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's more likely to reject and make a counteroffer.  Based on his response, I can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility on my part while still staying above my minimum price.  I'm hoping that this compromise will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $132.50? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm happy to accept Bob's counteroffer and close the deal."
