"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to me, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a profit.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm also trying to create a sense of collaboration to encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to come away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's in the middle of our current positions. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're getting closer.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $7,375. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I have to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I don't want to settle for a significantly lower price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,375 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a more equitable compromise. How about $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price but adding a more persuasive message to encourage Bob to accept. I'm also emphasizing the mutual benefits of the deal."
