"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. I'm confident that this price is fair and allows us both to make a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit steep, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm willing to offer $1050000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
