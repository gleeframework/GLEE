Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to aim for the highest price Bob might accept.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message highlights the potential value to Bob, even if the price is slightly above his perceived worth.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially leading to a higher profit than $12,000."
