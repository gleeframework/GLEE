Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit lower. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly is better than waiting for John, even if the price difference isn't huge.

This offer balances getting a great price from Bob with the security of knowing John is a guaranteed backup buyer."
