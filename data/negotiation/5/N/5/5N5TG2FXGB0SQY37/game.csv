"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $11,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
