"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $9,000 is too much, especially since you're willing to pay $8,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get Alice to come down to your price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8250}
