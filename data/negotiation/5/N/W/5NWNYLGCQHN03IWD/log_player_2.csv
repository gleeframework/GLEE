"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and start negotiating to see if you can get closer to your $800,000 limit.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given its value to you, I'm offering $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also allowing me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value to me and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant discount and is still within your budget.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still over your budget.  It's worth seeing if you can push her lower with a counteroffer. Remember, you have more rounds and can always go to John if you can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate the continued negotiation. While I'm eager to acquire this product, $1,050,000 remains above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offers a fair compromise,  allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant discount from my initial asking price. It's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still over your budget.  Even though she's lowered her price, you're still risking going over your $800,000 limit. It's worth trying to get a lower offer from Alice before going to John.  With multiple rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I acknowledge your need for a specific price, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  To demonstrate my strong interest in acquiring this product, I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This represents a significant commitment from me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the coming rounds."", ""product_price"": 975000}
