Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I wouldn't offer it to you at any less than $2,000,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $2,000,000 gives you a significant potential profit.
* **Confident language:**  Phrases like ""significant value"" and ""wouldn't offer it to you at any less"" emphasize the product's worth and create a sense of exclusivity.
* **Open to negotiation:** While the offer is high, the language leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging that Bob has a fixed maximum he's willing to pay."
