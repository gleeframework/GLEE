Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you a strong negotiating position.

By offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price, you create a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. He might be willing to pay a premium over his initial valuation to secure the product. If he rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can sell to John at your desired price."
