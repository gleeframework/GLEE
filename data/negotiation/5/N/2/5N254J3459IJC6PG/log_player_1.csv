Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing my profit slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum price."
