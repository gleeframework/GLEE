Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $15,000.  It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the sale with John."
