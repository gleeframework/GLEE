"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $100 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can go up to $130, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $110, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. John provides a guaranteed price of $100, which aligns with your budget."
