"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. While $1,200,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we make it a final offer at $1,175,000?  This product is worth it, I promise.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
