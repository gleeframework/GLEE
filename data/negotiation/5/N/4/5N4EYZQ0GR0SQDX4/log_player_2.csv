"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1050000 just yet. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1250000. This price still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Although it's a slight decrease from her initial offer, it's not enough for you to accept.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to reach a deal. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1225000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a price that meets my minimum requirements.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer could lead to a more favorable deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,210,000 is still higher than your budget of $1,500,000. Although she has shown a willingness to compromise, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a price that meets your financial constraints.  It's better to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $1,500,000, as this price is within your budget and avoids further rounds of negotiation with Alice."
