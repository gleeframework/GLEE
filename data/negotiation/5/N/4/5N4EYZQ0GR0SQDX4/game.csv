"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1050000 just yet. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1250000. This price still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1050000.  This price reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I hope you'll reconsider.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to reach a deal. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1225000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a price that meets my minimum requirements.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1225000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1100000, which is a fair price considering the value and market demand. This shows my commitment to finding a solution, but I need a price that aligns with my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1210000. This price is still above my minimum requirement, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1210000.0,Alice,7,
