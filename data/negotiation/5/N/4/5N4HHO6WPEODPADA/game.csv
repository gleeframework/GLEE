"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1200000. This gives you a significant profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
