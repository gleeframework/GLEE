# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer being rejected. Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product at your maximum budget."
