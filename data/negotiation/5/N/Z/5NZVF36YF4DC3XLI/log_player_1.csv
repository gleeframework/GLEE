{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high at $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a fallback option with John at $800,000, so I'm not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob.

This offer balances my desire to maximize profit with the understanding that an excessively high price might make Bob walk away."
