{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing its value. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to maximize my potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $95 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it's still higher than his initial perceived value ($80). This indicates that there's potential for a counteroffer that benefits both of us.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is far better than accepting Bob's offer and losing money.

**Next Step:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $95 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** $105 is a compromise between my minimum price ($120) and Bob's offer ($95). 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm still leaving the door open for further discussion.

By making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while remaining open to negotiation, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still a loss for me. Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, while accepting Bob's offer means losing $20. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still potential to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Step:**  I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you coming up to $100. However, I'm still hoping for a price that's a bit closer to my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $107.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** $107 is a compromise between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($100).  
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair price that benefits both of us.
* **Negotiation window:**  $107 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($120) while still being within Bob's perceived value range. 

I'm trying to close the gap and reach a deal without risking a lower profit by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Based on my budget constraints, I am comfortable paying $105 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Let me know if this offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $105 is only $2 away from my last counteroffer of $107. This signifies we're very close to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Closing the deal:**  While $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's a better outcome than selling to John and losing $15. 
* **Time factor:**  Continued negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk of losing Bob altogether or wasting more time. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm maximizing my profit in this situation. It's a good compromise and allows me to move on without further negotiation."
