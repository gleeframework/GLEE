{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's value for the product ($80), but it's still significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate while also ensuring I'm making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is more than Bob's value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($150). I can counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially increasing the chance of a deal while still securing a better profit than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's a fair price that still gives you a great deal on this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $110. How about we try $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $105.  This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's close this deal, how about it?"", ""product_price"": 105}
