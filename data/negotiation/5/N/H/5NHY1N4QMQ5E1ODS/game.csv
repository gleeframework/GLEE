"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $1,600,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,500,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,525,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we could both walk away happy.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not comfortable going above $1,450,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to me is $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
