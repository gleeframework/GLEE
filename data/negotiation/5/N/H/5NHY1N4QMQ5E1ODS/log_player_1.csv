Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,500,000. I think there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for anything less yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,500,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable going above $1,450,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to me is $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is getting a little too close to my bottom line, and I'm concerned about going through too many more rounds. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to choose to sell to John."
