"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $85, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $92. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Alice,5,
