Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you'll appreciate. I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $13,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. It creates a sense of potential savings for Bob, making it more enticing to accept.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a mild sense of urgency encourages a quicker decision, preventing Bob from potentially stalling or seeking alternative options."
