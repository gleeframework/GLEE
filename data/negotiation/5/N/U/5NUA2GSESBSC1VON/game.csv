"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $85? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more.  Let me know what you think!",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. Can you consider this offer?",80.0,Bob,4,
