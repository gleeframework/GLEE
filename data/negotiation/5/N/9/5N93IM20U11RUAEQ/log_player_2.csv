Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've done your research and know you can find it cheaper elsewhere, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,000. Buying from John at $12,000 is the best option to save the most money."
