"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
