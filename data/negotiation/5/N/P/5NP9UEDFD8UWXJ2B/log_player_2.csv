"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects its high value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than the initial $1,000,000, and closer to Bob's counteroffer of $900,000.
* **It's a better deal than John's:** Buying from Alice at $950,000 is still cheaper than buying from John at $1,200,000.
* **Continuing negotiation might not be worth it:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product."
