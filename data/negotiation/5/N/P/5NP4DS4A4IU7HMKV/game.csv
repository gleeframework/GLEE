"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still think the product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value you'll get from it.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get to a fair price, but I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $9,750. This is my final offer, as I don't want to lose the deal, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product.",9750.0,Alice,5,
