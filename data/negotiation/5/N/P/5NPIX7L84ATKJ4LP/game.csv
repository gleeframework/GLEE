,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to still benefit from the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and $1,400,000 is a more accurate reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This offer represents a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident the returns you'll see will make it worthwhile.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
