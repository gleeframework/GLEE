Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm confident I won't get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to accept and secure the sale."
