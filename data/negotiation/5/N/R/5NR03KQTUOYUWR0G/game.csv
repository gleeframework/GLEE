"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get the price down a bit. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both get a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a revised price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired price point. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm willing to make one more offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
