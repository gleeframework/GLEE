"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for the full value of the product to me. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and weigh it against the potential of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a significant drop from my initial offer but  closer to Bob's offer, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to consider selling to John. The risk of not closing a deal with Bob is becoming greater with each round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground in this round, but if Bob rejects again, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  I've gone through several rounds, and Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
