{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving you some room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves you room to potentially go lower if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price is not overly aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.

I'm choosing to start high and see how Bob responds. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price right away. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a great price for the product and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,000, which is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also trying to frame it positively, highlighting the benefits of this price for both of us.  I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $8,750 is still a little too low for me. I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can get closer to my desired price. 

I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price. However, if this final counteroffer is rejected, I'll accept John's offer of $10,000 to avoid losing out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,750 is still a little below where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, but that's my final offer. It's a great deal for a high-quality product, and it gives us both a win.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

This is my final offer. I'm lowering the price to $8,900, which is just $150 more than Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition and framing it as a win-win scenario.  I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to accept. 

If he rejects, I'm ready to sell to John and move on."
