"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's start the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. This is still a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $1,100,000 is her final offer. While this is a better price than her previous offers, you have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice if you can get the product for your target price elsewhere."
