Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows for some negotiation room while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) and below your minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Highlighting value:**  By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly nudge Bob to reconsider his initial valuation and potentially see the benefits he might be overlooking. 
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter-offer:** If Bob finds $125 too high, this opening offer allows him to propose a counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still profitable for you.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging the potential for a deal with Bob. If Bob rejects this offer, you can still fall back on selling to John at your desired minimum price."
