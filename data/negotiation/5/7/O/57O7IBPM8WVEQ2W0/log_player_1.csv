``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price of $1,500,000 as possible.  By offering $1,400,000, I leave some room for negotiation while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  I'm also confident that Bob will see the value in this product, and that he'll be motivated to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to consider it, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm aiming for, it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a compromise."
