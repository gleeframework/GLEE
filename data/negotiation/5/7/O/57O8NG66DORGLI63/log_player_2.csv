# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your max price:** $100
* **Alice's offer:** $95
* **John's offer:** $100

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice. This means you have room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you leverage to potentially get a better deal either with Alice or with John."
