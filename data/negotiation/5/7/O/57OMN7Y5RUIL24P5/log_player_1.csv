I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk ending up with a deal that's too low. John is guaranteed to pay my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that certainty by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
