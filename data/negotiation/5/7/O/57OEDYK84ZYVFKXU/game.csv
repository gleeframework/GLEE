"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your perspective, $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my own costs. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
