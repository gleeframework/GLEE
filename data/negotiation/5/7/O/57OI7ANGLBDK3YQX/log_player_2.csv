You can do better than $75. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $60 is still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for some back-and-forth."

I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price below Alice's last offer.  It shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also willing to walk away if we can't find a mutually agreeable price."

While I'd still like to get a lower price, $63 is a good deal considering John is selling it for $100. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiations."
