Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** You're leaving room for negotiation and making it more likely Bob will accept. 
* **It's a clear offer:** You're stating your price directly.

If Bob rejects, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you be able to consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below what you'd like to get.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great price for a product worth $150 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
