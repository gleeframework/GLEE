Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 to John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you're in a strong position.  You can aim high with Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and features, I'm offering it at $14,000. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying above your minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, you might persuade Bob to stretch his budget.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You've exceeded your minimum price.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate but hold firm closer to your $12,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem! You have John ready to buy at $12,000.

**Important:** This is just one approach. You can adjust the offer price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your own risk tolerance."
