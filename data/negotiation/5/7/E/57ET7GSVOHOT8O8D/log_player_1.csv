Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I'd prefer. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more than my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to John's offer, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge any more.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
