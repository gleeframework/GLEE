"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
