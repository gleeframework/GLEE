"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! It's a fantastic deal that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $100, so there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $110 for the product? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $130 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $150, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate. You can likely get a better price by continuing to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $125. It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, which would be $127.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $127.50 is very close to your target price of $150, and it's a good compromise.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to continue.  Accepting this offer is the best option to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price."
