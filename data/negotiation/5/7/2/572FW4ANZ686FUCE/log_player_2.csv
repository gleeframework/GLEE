"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $10,000 to you at a slightly discounted price. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly discounted, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to his goal of spending no more than $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your own asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer at $8,750 for the product. This is the highest price I can go for now, given its value to you and my own asking price. I hope this proposal works for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,750 is still slightly above Bob's ideal price of $8,000, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $9,500.  Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it's a good compromise and saves him $1,250 compared to buying from John."
