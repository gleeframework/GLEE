Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is calculated based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to you.
* **John's Value:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000.

By offering $1,400,000, you:

* **Maximize your profit:** You earn $400,000 more than selling to John.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob still has a potential gain of $100,000, incentivizing him to accept. 

While you could offer a higher price, the risk is that Bob might reject it and you'll be left with John's offer. This approach balances maximizing profit with a reasonable chance of closing the deal with Bob."
