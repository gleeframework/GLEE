"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? This would give us both a good deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,125. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know what you think.",13125.0,Alice,5,
