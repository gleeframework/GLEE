"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, leaving room for negotiation.  I should try a counteroffer significantly lower to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($6,000) allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.  This offer is still well above her value of $8,000, so there's a chance she might accept. Even if she rejects it, it provides a basis for further negotiation and finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $7,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved a bit from her initial offer, but $7,500 is still a significant markup from her $8,000 value. I'll try to meet her halfway between our last offers to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 6750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Offering $6,750 splits the difference between my previous offer ($6,000) and Alice's current offer ($7,500). This demonstrates willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $7,200, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to nudge the price closer to her previous offer, but the difference is getting smaller. At $7,200, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of Alice backing out or the price going higher. It's a reasonable deal, and I'm happy to secure the product at this price."
