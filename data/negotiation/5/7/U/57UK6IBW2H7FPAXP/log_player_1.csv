Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Bottom Line:** $1,000,000 (John's guaranteed offer)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also need to ensure Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept. Offering a price closer to his valuation increases your chances of a quick sale.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves you a $150,000 profit margin, significantly more than John's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:** Presenting it as a ""fair deal"" and mentioning ""return on investment"" appeals to Bob's business sense.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be more appealing.

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and messaging based on your assessment of Bob and the overall situation."
