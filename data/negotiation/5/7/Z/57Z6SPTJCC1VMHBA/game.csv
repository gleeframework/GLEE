"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. While I recognize the value you see in this product, $1,800,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $2,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
