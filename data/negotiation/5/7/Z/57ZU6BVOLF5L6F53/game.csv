"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
