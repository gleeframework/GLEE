"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John.  It makes the most financial sense to accept her offer."
