Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $600,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of reach. I'm prepared to go up to $750,000, which is a significant jump from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

We're getting closer, but I'm still leaving money on the table if I accept $750,000.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can get closer to $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting really close! I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's try $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to move forward.  What do you say?

Bob has met my baseline price. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or selling to John for the same amount."
