{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This will give me a good starting point and allow me to potentially earn more.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $130. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $140. This is a fair price for this high-quality product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise that's still higher than my minimum but shows that I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I can definitely consider purchasing at $135. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is close to my minimum acceptable price and it seems unlikely that I'll be able to get a significantly higher offer. It's better to accept his offer and get a relatively good price than risk losing the sale entirely."
