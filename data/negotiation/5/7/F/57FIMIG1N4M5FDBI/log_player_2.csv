"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from Alice, but it's worth $1,500,000 to you. This means there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's bottom line is $1,200,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal. This counteroffer leaves room for both of us to compromise and reach a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, and I'm willing to raise my offer slightly.  $1,100,000 is still significantly below the $1,300,000 she's offering, leaving room for further negotiation. This counteroffer shows my willingness to compromise while still trying to achieve a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting too close to John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the product entirely.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John, as I can secure the product for a price that's within my budget."
