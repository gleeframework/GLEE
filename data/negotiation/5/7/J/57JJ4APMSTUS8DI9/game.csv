"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $16000?  That's my absolute maximum.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $17000, but that's my final offer.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm still looking to get a good price for the product, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to counter with an offer of $17500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",17500.0,Alice,5,
