"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $900,000 is still less than the $1,000,000 John is asking. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise by lowering her price. Accepting this offer means a deal is reached quickly and Bob avoids potentially more rounds of negotiation.

While Bob could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk Alice might also reject and the negotiation could drag on. Accepting the offer at $900,000  is a good compromise that saves Bob money."
