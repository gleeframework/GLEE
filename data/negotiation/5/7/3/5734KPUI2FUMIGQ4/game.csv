"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 was a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $92 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Would you be willing to go up to $94? That's a fair compromise, and it shows you're serious about buying the product. Let's make this happen!",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $94, which would be $93. Can you consider that?",93.0,Bob,6,
