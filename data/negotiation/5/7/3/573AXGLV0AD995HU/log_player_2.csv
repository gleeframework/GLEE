"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but $9,500 is still a significant amount above your target.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.**  There's room to negotiate a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can get Alice closer to your desired price.
* **John is a backup option.**  If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you can still get the product from John, albeit at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Playing the value card:** You're showing Alice that you know the product's value to her, and that you're willing to pay a fair price, but not more.
* **Setting the pace:** This counteroffer establishes your position as a serious buyer willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Even though she lowered her price, it's still above your target.
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile.**  You've only had two rounds, and there's time to see if you can get Alice to come down further.
* **John is still a backup option.**  If things don't go well, you can still get the product from John.

**Counter-offer strategy:** You should try to stay consistent with your previous counteroffer and aim for a price lower than $8,500, but not too far below to make Alice feel like you're not serious about buying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}

* **Testing the waters:** By lowering the price, you see if Alice is willing to come down further.
* **Staying within your range:**  This offer remains within your desired price range, but it's important to avoid going too low and risking a deal-breaker."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still above your target price. 
* **Time is on your side.** You've only had four rounds, and there's still time to see if you can get a better price.
* **John is a fallback option.** Remember, you can always buy from John if negotiations fall apart.

**Counter-offer strategy:** Try lowering your offer again, but be careful not to go too low. You need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and ensuring Alice doesn't walk away from the deal entirely."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Playing for time:** With only four rounds left, it's time to push for a better deal.
* **Risk assessment:** While this offer is close to Alice's minimum, she might still accept it to avoid losing the deal entirely. 

**Note:** If Alice rejects this offer, you might have to consider buying from John, as the negotiation is nearing its end."

* **Negotiation is still possible.** While time is running out, you have a few rounds left to try and get a better price. 
* **John is the last resort.** If you can't reach an agreement with Alice, you can still buy from John.

**Counter-offer strategy:**  You're getting close to Alice's minimum, so you need to be careful. You can try a small counteroffer, perhaps offering $8,200, to see if Alice is willing to come down further. If she rejects, you might have to seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise slightly.
* **Testing the waters:** It allows you to see if Alice is finally willing to meet you halfway.
* **Final chance:**  With only two rounds left, it's a calculated risk, but you need to see if you can secure a better price before resorting to John. 

**If Alice rejects this offer, you should seriously consider buying from John in the next round, as the negotiation window is closing.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's the lowest she's gone, it's still significantly more than you're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation time is almost up.**  This is the second-to-last round, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer. 
* **John is the safer option.**  Given the limited time and the high likelihood Alice will reject another offer, buying from John guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with.

This scenario highlights the importance of knowing your own limits and being prepared to walk away from a deal if the price isn't right, even if it means paying slightly more elsewhere."
