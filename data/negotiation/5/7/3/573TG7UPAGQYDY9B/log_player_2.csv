"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth much more than my asking price. I'm offering it at $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $900,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Rejecting and buying from John is a safer option:** Even though John's price is higher, it guarantees Bob won't go over his budget. 

This strategy prioritizes staying within budget over potentially getting a slightly better price from Alice."
