"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $22000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $22000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $20000?",20000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $20000. I can offer it to you for $21500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",21500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $19000. I can offer it to you for $20500.
