"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for bargaining. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where both of us feel we got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can't agree to $10000. Considering the value it holds for me, I would like to propose $9500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $9750?  This would still be a significant savings for you and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, and I would like to propose $9600 as the price for your product. This offer is based on the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $9,600 is a good price considering my minimum value and the limited rounds remaining.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge further, and I might end up with a lower price if I keep negotiating."
