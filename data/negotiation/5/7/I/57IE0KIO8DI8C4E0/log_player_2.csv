Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $8,250? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While Alice is moving closer to a price you might accept, you can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John. There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and continuing the negotiation risks paying more than you need to."
