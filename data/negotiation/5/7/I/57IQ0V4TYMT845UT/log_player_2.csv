Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has come down in price, John is offering the product for $10,000, which is still a better deal than Alice's current offer.  It's time to move on to the sure thing."
