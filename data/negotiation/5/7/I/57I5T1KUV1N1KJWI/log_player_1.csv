Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still ensuring a profit above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose out.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit from Bob while having a guaranteed sale to John."
