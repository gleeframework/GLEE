Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to accept something too low. 
* **Plan B:**  I know I can get $12,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in negotiating. I'm willing to give it another try.
* **Selling to John is my fallback.** I'm aware I can get $12,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $9,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposing:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by lowering my price to $9,500, but still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, hoping to close the deal. 
* **Plan B:** I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price."
