Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your $80 minimum, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's not too high:** $120 is a decent compromise, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a good profit.
* **It's open-ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond and engage in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a decent price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I can still sell to John for $80 as a backup, so I have some negotiating room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Bob is showing interest and willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $80 if this deal falls through. Accepting this offer will secure a decent profit and move the negotiation forward."
