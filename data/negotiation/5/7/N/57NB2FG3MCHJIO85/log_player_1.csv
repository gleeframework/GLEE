Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if it's better to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I hope it's more appealing to Bob than his last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to offer $16,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value of $15,000 and his last offer of $10,000. I hope this will be enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I might consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum value.  I've tried to negotiate with him, but it seems we can't reach an agreement.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and saves further time and effort in negotiating with Bob."
