Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects its value to you, while also being more in line with your budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $1,000,000 and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
