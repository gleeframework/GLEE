"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm motivated to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $10,000, which is the same amount John is offering.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go any higher. It's best to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
