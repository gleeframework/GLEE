Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I can offer you the product for $12,250. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,250.  Since you have the option to buy from John at $12,000, it makes more financial sense to do so and save the extra $250."
