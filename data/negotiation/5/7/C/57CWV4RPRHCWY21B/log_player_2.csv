Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price point.  I'm proposing $1600000. This reflects a fair compromise while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on this unique product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1450000 is still not quite there for me.  To be honest, this product is worth a lot more to me than $1500000.  However, I am committed to making this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1550000.
