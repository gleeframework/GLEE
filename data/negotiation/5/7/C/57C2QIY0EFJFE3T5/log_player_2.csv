"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $150 maximum.
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** Our target is to get the product for a price closer to Alice's value ($120). Starting low increases the chances of landing a price that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a good deal for you as it's well below what it's worth to you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's try to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $125 is a very reasonable price, especially considering our maximum budget is $150 and the product is worth $120 to Alice.
* **Negotiation Success:** Alice has already moved closer to our desired price range. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down or her raising the price again. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now secures the product quickly and efficiently."
