I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
