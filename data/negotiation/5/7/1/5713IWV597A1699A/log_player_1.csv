Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price around $1,150,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,150,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,150,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  It's not a huge loss and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price."
