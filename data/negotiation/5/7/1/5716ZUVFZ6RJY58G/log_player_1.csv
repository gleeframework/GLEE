"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport and increase the likelihood of a successful deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows me to adjust my price if necessary while still maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Keeping John as an option:**  Remember, I can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a bit higher than what I was hoping to pay, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment, it's still below my desired price. There's room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable compromise. 
* **Preserving options:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the door open to further negotiations and potentially reaching a higher price. I can still choose to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce why my price is justified. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages a positive outcome.
* **Leaving room for more negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for further adjustments if needed, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $8,800. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited negotiation space:**  While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, his offer is still too low. It's unlikely he will go much higher.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps my options open. I can still negotiate further with Bob or sell to John for a better price. 
* **Focusing on long-term value:**  Selling to John at $12,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,800 is still quite a bit below what I need.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $9,200.  I'm confident this price is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:**  I'm sticking to a price that's closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing how this price benefits both of us, making it seem like a fair compromise. 
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm suggesting this is the price that will allow me to move forward, adding a bit of pressure to get a deal done. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  I'm still ready to sell to John for $12,000 if Bob doesn't come up to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $8,900. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited room for improvement:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiations are stalling:** There's very little room for further negotiation, and Bob seems unwilling to come up to a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Time is ticking:** We are already halfway through the negotiations, and I'm running out of rounds.
* **Guarantee a good deal:**  Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and allows me to move on without wasting more time. 

At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed sale to John rather than risking further rounds of negotiation with Bob that are unlikely to result in a significantly better price."
