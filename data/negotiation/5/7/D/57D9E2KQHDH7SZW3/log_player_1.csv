Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $150, we can see how interested Bob is. If he outright rejects it, we know he's very price-sensitive. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's no risk of losing money even if Bob declines.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  We can always negotiate down closer to $120 if Bob shows resistance but seems genuinely interested."
