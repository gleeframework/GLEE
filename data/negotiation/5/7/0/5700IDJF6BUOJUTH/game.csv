"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I know it's worth at least that to you, and it's the best I can do right now.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  While $100 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
