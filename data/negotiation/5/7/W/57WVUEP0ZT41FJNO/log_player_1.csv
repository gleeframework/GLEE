Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This allows for negotiation room and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Understanding Bob:**  I don't know Bob's value for the product, so starting high allows me to gauge his interest.  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate.
* **The backup option:**  John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I know Bob is interested, as he made a counteroffer, and I believe I can convince him to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:**  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to make more if possible.  

I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm reducing my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, showing a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. 
* **Still above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. If he rejects again, I might need to consider selling to John. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is getting tough:** Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price.  
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer again, he might walk away, and I'd be left with only the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.

It's better to secure a sale at $900,000 than risk losing the deal entirely."
