"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price for the product at $12000? This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a valuable solution at a more affordable rate.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8000.  It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price for the value I'll be getting.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand your budget constraints. To facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider your offer of $8000. However, I need to ensure that we both receive value from this transaction. Could we perhaps include some additional services or support with the product at this price point?",8000.0,Alice,5,
