"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product at $15,000. You can get the product for the same price from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense as you can get the product for the same price elsewhere."
