"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'd like to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. Is that something you'd be interested in?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $160 is still a little high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking with your previous offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go slightly lower, but I need to be at least at $155 to make it worth my while. Can you meet me at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
