"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
