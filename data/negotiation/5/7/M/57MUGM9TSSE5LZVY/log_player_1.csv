Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $95 is a reasonable outcome in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Profit:** $95 is still a profit over Bob's perceived value of $80.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations might not result in a significantly better offer from Bob. Selling to John for $100 might seem like a better option, but there's a time cost associated with finding another buyer. 
* **Bird in Hand:**  It's often better to secure a decent deal now than risk losing it by pushing for a slightly higher price."
