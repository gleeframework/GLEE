"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Being Friendly:** I'm opening with a friendly message to build rapport.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $100 is still below what the product is worth to Bob, making it likely he'll counteroffer. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Good:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **More Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to try and push for a better price.
* **John is a Backup:**  While John is a safe option, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet.

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That seems fair to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  $95 is still a good profit for me, but leaves room for Bob to counter if he's really set on $90. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly to avoid a breakdown in negotiations.

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $85 is only $5 above my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. It's only 3 rounds left, and I want to try and get a little closer to $90. 
* **Potential for a Compromise:** Bob is getting closer to my price, suggesting he might be willing to move a bit more. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  I'm aware that if I reject too many offers, I might end up selling to John for $80. 

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet halfway again, at $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is my last chance to get closer to my desired price of $90.  
* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise, hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept.
* **Clear and Concise:**  I'm being direct and clear about my position to avoid any misunderstandings. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. I'm willing to go up to $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $92.5 is a good compromise, considering I started at $100. It's also just $2.50 away from my desired price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision quickly.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer or that I won't be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
