"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I see the value in this product,  $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to balance that with the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, while giving you a discount from my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $950000. This price is fair given the product's value and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
