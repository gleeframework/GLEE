Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
