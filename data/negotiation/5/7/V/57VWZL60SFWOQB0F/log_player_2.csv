"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far beyond your budget. It's crucial to start negotiating and bring the price down.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and start the negotiation process."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above your budget. Continuing to negotiate will likely result in a better price. It's worth taking another round to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,600,000 is still above your desired budget. It's worth pushing for a lower price.  There are still a few rounds remaining, and you can potentially get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To bridge the remaining gap, I propose a final offer of $1,450,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end while ensuring the product's value is recognized.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```
