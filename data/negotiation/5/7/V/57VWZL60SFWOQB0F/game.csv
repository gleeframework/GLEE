"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while also being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
