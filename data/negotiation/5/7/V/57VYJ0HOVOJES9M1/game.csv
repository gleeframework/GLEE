"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll offer you a slight adjustment to $810,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the adjustment.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000.  To make it worth my while to go with your product instead, I'd need you to come down to $780,000.  This is my final offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
