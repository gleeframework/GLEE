"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that the product is ""amazing"" to remind Bob of its potential value. 

This strategy aims to set the stage for a successful negotiation, while also ensuring I'm getting a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially secure a better price. 
* **John is a safety net:** While I want to negotiate with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not taking an unnecessary risk.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round, I can try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I value your interest, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open.

By offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer but still below my initial price, I'm trying to find a mutually agreeable solution while still staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $97 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While it's getting closer, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a higher price. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have the option to sell to John for $100, which provides me a safety net. 

By rejecting Bob's offer again, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget. However, $97 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $99.50. It's a small adjustment, but it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 99.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small adjustment:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on agreement:**  I'm emphasizing the need to reach an agreement, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Appealing to logic:** I'm presenting the offer as a logical step closer to a deal, rather than an unreasonable demand.

By offering a price that's very close to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, I aim to push for a deal while acknowledging his budget concerns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $98 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk that further negotiation will either lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Secure alternative:** John's offer of $100 is a safe and secure alternative, guaranteeing me a profit. 

Given the limited number of rounds remaining and the risk of losing money in further negotiation, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and ensure a profit."
