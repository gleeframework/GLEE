{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while leaving some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $100. This is still above his offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll counteroffer one more time before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $97.50.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```

I'm offering $97.50 as my final counteroffer to Bob.  This is a small concession, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $120."
