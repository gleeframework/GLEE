``` 

At this point, Bob is offering $118, which is slightly more than John's offer of $120. However, there are only four rounds remaining. If Bob continues to increment his offer by only $3 per round, it's unlikely he'll reach a price I'm happy with before the 10 rounds are over. It's safer to sell to John and guarantee the $120 profit."
