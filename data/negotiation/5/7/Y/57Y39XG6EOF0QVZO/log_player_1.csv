Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, Alice is still likely to get a better price than the $12,000 John is offering. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup buyer."
