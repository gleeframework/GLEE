"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. To make this work, I'd need to go with $10,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can we consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
