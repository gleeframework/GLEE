"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest in selling your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $15000 is significantly below the value of the product to me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let's find a compromise that works for both sides.",17500.0,Alice,3,
