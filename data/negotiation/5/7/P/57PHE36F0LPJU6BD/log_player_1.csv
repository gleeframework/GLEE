"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a significant amount to you. Let's start our negotiation with this price and see where we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than my minimum. This sets a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm leaving room to lower the price in subsequent rounds, showing flexibility and a willingness to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I'm being respectful by acknowledging Bob's offer, even though I'm rejecting it.
* **Lowering the Price:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and emphasizing the ""fair"" price being offered. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose $1,400,000 as a compromise. I hope this is a price that you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm not ready to settle for that price. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially given the value the product holds for Bob. I'll continue negotiating and hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the value it holds for your business. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise by coming down to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the value this deal has for both of us.  This helps to reinforce that I'm not simply trying to squeeze the most money out of him. 
* **Create Urgency (Implied):**  By stating that this deal will be ""mutually beneficial,"" I am implying that if he doesn't take this offer, he might lose out on a valuable opportunity.

**Reasoning:**

This round is crucial. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping he will accept. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I would like to counter with $1,450,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price.  While I could counter again, it is highly likely that Bob will not budge any further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $1,500,000, securing a guaranteed profit and avoiding further negotiation uncertainty."
