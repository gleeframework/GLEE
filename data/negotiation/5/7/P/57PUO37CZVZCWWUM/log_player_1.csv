Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value specifically to Bob, you increase the perceived worth and justify the high price.
* **Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to accept."
