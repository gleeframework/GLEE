Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my minimum asking price and still allows you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer strikes a balance:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum:** This makes it appealing to Bob, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable for me:**  $900,000 is a good starting point, especially since I have the backup option of selling to John for $1,000,000.

This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you some profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's closer than his initial offer. It's worth exploring further negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $875,000 for the product. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet halfway and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will allow you to make a profit. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring a better profit margin for me.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, so I'm choosing to sell to John."
