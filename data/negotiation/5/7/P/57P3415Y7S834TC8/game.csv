"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my minimum asking price and still allows you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you some profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $875,000 for the product. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet halfway and see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will allow you to make a profit. Let's close the deal at this price.",860000.0,Bob,4,
