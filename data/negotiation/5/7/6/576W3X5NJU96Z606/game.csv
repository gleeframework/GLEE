"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $2000000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1800000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a great deal for you as well.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1400000, which would be $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1700000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a great deal for you as well.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1700000 and $1400000, which would be $1550000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet on a price, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my target of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1650000 and $1200000, which would be $1425000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1425000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I'm extremely disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement on a price. I've been willing to meet you halfway multiple times, and I've made serious concessions. I'm willing to make one last offer: I'll meet you at $1400000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $1200000. I'm giving you one last chance to make a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,10,
