"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
