"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's something that's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  My asking price is $1250000.  This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire something valuable at a competitive price.  I understand you can always choose to decline, as I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1200000, but I believe this is a chance to acquire something truly special at a slightly better price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
