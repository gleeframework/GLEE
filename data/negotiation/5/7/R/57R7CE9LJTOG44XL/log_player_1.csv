{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob:**  The message emphasizes the value for Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer.

This approach is designed to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a good price.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chance that we can reach an agreement.
* **Keep the option of selling to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to get closer to my desired price. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal before accepting his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500, which is halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize how it's still a ""great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains positive and emphasizes a willingness to close the deal. 

This approach aims to:

* **Increase the Price:** I'm moving closer to my desired price without completely shutting down the negotiation.
* **Maintain a Positive Atmosphere:** The positive tone encourages Bob to continue the discussion.
* **Keep the Option to Sell to John:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm going to try one more time to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if there's any room for him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the sale today. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This is my final counteroffer, and it's a slight compromise from my previous offer.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I emphasize the benefits of reaching a deal and how it would be ""great for both of us.""
* **Sense of Urgency:** I mention ""closing the sale today"" to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept.

This approach aims to:

* **Secure a Higher Price:** I'm trying to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **End the Negotiation:**  This is likely my final offer, so I want to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Avoid Selling to John:**  I'm hoping to avoid selling to John, as I'd rather get a slightly lower price from Bob."
