"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a reasonable counteroffer, offering a price that's closer to Alice's value but still leaves room for further negotiation. This shows good faith while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to compromise but the price is still higher than Bob's desired outcome. There are still 7 rounds left and Bob has time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now in a strong position. He's shown his willingness to negotiate and Alice has lowered her price, demonstrating her desire to make a deal. A counteroffer of $9,500 is a small increase from Bob's previous offer and could be seen as a sign of good faith. It's still significantly lower than Alice's offer and closer to Bob's desired price point. This should encourage Alice to accept the offer, but there are still enough rounds left for Bob to make further counteroffers if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, but it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, and Bob can continue to negotiate.  The risk of buying from John is still present, but Bob wants to see if he can close the deal with Alice for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by moving slightly closer to Alice's previous offer, but it's still significantly lower than her latest price. With only four rounds left, Bob is putting more pressure on Alice to close the deal. If Alice is truly motivated to sell, this is a price she should seriously consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still pushing for a higher price, but Bob is determined to get a better deal. There are only 3 rounds left, which means there's not much time to negotiate. However, Bob is still confident he can get a lower price.  He will continue to try and negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his desired amount.  He's still willing to walk away and buy from John if necessary, but he's not giving up on getting a better deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Bob needs to make a strong final push. He increases his offer slightly from the previous round to $10,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about closing the deal but still firm in his stance. It's also a price that's significantly lower than Alice's last offer and could be a good compromise.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can then decide whether to accept her final counteroffer or move on to John in the last round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now the same as John's. This means that there is no longer any benefit to negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob has a clear alternative, he should purchase from John and avoid any risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer."
