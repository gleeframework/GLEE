"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal compared to John's $150, you're trying to save as much money as possible. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I value the product at $150, I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to do $135? "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $135 is a bit too low for me. How about $138? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $138 is still within my budget, and it's a better price than John's $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my offer again and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees I get the product at a good price without taking unnecessary risks."
