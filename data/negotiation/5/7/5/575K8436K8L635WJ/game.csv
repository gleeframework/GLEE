"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I value the product at $150, I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to do $135? ",135.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $135 is a bit too low for me. How about $138? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",138.0,Alice,3,
