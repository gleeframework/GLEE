"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, but I still have room to negotiate.** I'm willing to take a slight loss compared to my initial offer, but I believe I can get a better price if I continue the negotiation. 
* **I'm not desperate to sell, as I have a backup buyer in John.** This gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer.** This suggests he is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but the risk of Bob backing out is increasing.** With only 6 rounds remaining, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **$11,100 is still a good profit for me, above my minimum threshold of $10,000.**  This makes it a worthwhile deal."
