"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $11,500 is within my budget, it's still quite close to my maximum. There's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500, which is a full $1,000 less than Alice's initial asking price. This gives me some room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Respectful but Firm:** My message is polite and expresses interest in the product, but it's also firm about my budget limitations.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts me in a good position for future rounds of negotiation. It lets Alice know I'm serious about buying but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $11,000 is still above my ideal price.  I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get closer to $10,500. There's still some room to negotiate before I need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit, but $11,000 is still a stretch for me. How about $10,750? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  I'm showing Alice I'm willing to compromise by moving closer to her price. $10,750 is a reasonable counter to her $11,000.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about this price point and unlikely to go higher. It adds a sense of urgency for her to accept.
* **Still Below John's Price:**  Crucially, $10,750 keeps me well below John's offer of $12,000, giving me some leverage and a safety net if the negotiation fails."
