{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Focus on value:** I'm subtly highlighting the product's value by saying ""I think you'll love it."" This helps create a sense of desirability and may encourage Bob to see the product as worth more than $80. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! I've successfully sold the product for more than my minimum price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it and make a counteroffer, or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to work towards that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While $80 is acceptable, it's my absolute minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has expressed interest and a willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's room for compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Bob's offer carries a risk that he might walk away. However, the potential reward of a higher price outweighs this risk.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly above $80. I'll use this counteroffer to gauge Bob's willingness to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $100 to $85. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a margin above my minimum.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""meeting halfway"" proposition, which appeals to a sense of fairness and may make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question (""Would you be willing to meet me halfway?""), encouraging Bob to consider my offer and respond. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully sold the product for a price above my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer.
* If Bob rejects: I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it and make a new counteroffer, or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $5 away from my initial offer of $95, and it's a significant improvement over my minimum of $80.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate. It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could waste valuable time, especially considering I have a guaranteed sale to John at $80.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, finalize the sale, and move on to other opportunities."
