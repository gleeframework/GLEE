Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000,  getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,150,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving us negotiation room.
    * It's still a substantial savings compared to John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and Alice will have to settle for the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
