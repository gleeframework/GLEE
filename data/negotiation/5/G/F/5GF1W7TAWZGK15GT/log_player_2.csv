"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $115, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $115.  While she might come down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John, which is a better outcome than a possible $110-115 deal with Alice."
