"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,050,000. Would you be willing to settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
