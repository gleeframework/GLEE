"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500, as this is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value you see in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the best price I can accept, considering its value to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,750.
