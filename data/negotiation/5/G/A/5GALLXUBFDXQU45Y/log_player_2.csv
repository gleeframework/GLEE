"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer. You can try to get a better price from her before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll really like it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

You should accept Alice's offer. It's a fair price for you, and it's still lower than buying from John."
