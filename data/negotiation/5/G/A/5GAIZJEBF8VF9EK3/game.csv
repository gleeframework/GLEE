"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm only able to offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. To try to find common ground, I am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to offer the product for $95 instead of $120. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $80.",80.0,Bob,4,
