Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a reasonable price considering my minimum value for the product is $80. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $80, so I'm not losing money. By offering a slightly higher price, I increase the chances of Bob accepting and maximizing my profit."
