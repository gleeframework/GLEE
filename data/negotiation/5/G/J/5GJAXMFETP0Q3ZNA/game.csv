"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $13000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  Would you consider $13500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,5,
