Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,500.  It's better to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
