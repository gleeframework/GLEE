"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it. He's essentially trying to get the product at a price that's more advantageous to him than me, and there are still rounds remaining. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price, but it's also more appealing to Bob since it's closer to his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one.  $10,750 is a good compromise. It's closer to his offer, but still gives me a decent profit. We're getting closer to a deal, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm still only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still get closer to my goal, and I don't want to settle for a price that leaves me feeling dissatisfied. I'll see if I can push Bob a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a compromise, but I'm confident I can still get a better deal than John's offer. With only three rounds remaining, I need to be aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's still better than selling to John for my minimum price. There's a chance I could get a higher offer in the next round, but there's also a chance Bob could reject my counteroffer and I'd be left with no deal. It's time to secure a sale."
