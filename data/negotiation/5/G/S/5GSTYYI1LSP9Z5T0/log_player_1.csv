"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will gain from owning the product.
* **Setting the stage:**  This initial offer establishes my position and signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation.  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob or choose to sell to John.
* **Next steps:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,400,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, acknowledging the value you see in this product. This would be a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer is significantly closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on fairness:** The message frames the price as a fair solution for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum price, keeping some leverage in case Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the target:**  Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject, I risk Bob walking away and then having to settle for John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting, I can still explore options to increase the price in future rounds if there's room for maneuver."
