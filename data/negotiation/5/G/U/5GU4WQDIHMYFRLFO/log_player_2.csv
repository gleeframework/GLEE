It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."

I'm starting with a price closer to my limit, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, it's still worth seeing if I can get it lower.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer before going with John."
