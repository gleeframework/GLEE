**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is consistently meeting in the middle and we're getting close to a good deal. Accepting at $770,000 secures the product at a significant savings compared to John's offer ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
