"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
