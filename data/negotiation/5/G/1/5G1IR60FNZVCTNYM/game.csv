"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
