"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a great value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to get the product without breaking my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $92.50? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product offers.",92.5,Alice,5,
