# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and propose a price of $787,500. This is a very competitive offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $787,500. It's better to secure the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
