"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $850,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. Bob can then buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within his budget."
