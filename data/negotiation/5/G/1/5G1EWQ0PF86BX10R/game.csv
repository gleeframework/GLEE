"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your position, $950,000 is significantly lower than its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still provides you a strong return on your investment, and allows me to fairly represent the product's worth.  Let's find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
