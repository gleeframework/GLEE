"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you. I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Buying from Alice for $1,100,000 saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Even though the product is worth more to Bob than Alice's asking price, accepting her offer still saves money."
