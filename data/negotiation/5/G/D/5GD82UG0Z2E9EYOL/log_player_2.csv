"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is still more than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's final offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's budget, and it's unlikely she will go lower.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, it's the best option."
