"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $10,500?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get closer to a deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This would be a good compromise and ensure we both get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,750? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",10750.0,Bob,6,
