"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, and it shows I'm serious about making a deal with you.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,200 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,600? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!",10600.0,Alice,5,
