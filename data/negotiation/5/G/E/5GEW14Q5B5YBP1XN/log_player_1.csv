"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and create a positive atmosphere.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me to justify the price. 

I'm aiming to start the negotiation at a high price point, but I'm leaving room for bargaining. This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price while still maintaining the possibility of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, and I believe there's room for negotiation. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, and it shows I'm serious about making a deal with you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Reason:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing the drop from my initial price. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to see the potential for a win-win scenario.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I value the product at.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, but I'm willing to be reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,200 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price. I believe I can still negotiate further and secure a better deal.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I will aim for a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,200 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,600? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground price that acknowledges Bob's offer while still getting me closer to my desired price.
* **Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair and allows both of us to be happy with the outcome.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.

This strategy aims to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,600 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,400 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob isn't likely to yield a significantly better price.  He's clearly not willing to go higher than $10,400, and I'm still hesitant to sell for that amount.  

With John offering a much more attractive price of $15,000, it's in my best interest to cut my losses and sell to him.  This ensures a much higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could potentially lead to a lower sale price or a complete stalemate."
