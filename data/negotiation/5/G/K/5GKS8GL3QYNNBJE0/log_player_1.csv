{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and a good starting point for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum desired price, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate.  It's a good starting point that might lead to a successful deal while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is the maximum I am willing to spend, as it aligns better with my budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This way we can both walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
