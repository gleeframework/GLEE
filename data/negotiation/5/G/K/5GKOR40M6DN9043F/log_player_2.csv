"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd find it highly valuable.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you, and allows me to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate further with her or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
