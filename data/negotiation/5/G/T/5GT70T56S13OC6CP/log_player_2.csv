"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1000000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $725,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue striving for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  While $725,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $725000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $720000. This is a final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $720,000, which is only a small amount higher than Bob's previous counteroffer of $700,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $280,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation and secures a decent price."
