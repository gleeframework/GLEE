"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit but leaving room for negotiation.  This price is still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob, making it likely he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good profit, I can likely get more by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,050,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a substantial profit. Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to counteroffer again, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is a good offer, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer. I'll continue the negotiation with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,025,000. This is getting closer to Bob's previous offer, showing him that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will convince him to come up a little more and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $990,000 is a good offer and close to my ideal price, I still believe I can negotiate a bit higher.  I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm proposing a final counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I believe it's close enough to Bob's previous offer that he'll accept."
