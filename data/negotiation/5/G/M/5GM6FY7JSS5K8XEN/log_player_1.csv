Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for your needs and am willing to offer it at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than John's offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting that the product is being offered to him before a public listing might make Bob more inclined to accept."
