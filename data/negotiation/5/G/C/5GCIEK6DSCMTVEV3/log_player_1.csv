Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but if he's not, I can always lower the price later.  It's also important to remember that if Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I am happy with $8,000 as my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise that is closer to my initial offer, but still shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it. If not, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get $9,000,  $8,500 is still a good price for the product, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. It's also possible that if I reject Bob's offer, he will not make another counteroffer, which would leave me with no other option but to sell to John."
