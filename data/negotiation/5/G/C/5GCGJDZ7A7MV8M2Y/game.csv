"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer.  My initial offer is $900,000.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This acknowledges the value you see in the product, but also ensures I receive a fair return. I'm confident we can finalize a deal that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $850,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

I'm confident we can finalize a deal that benefits both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for this product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,6,
