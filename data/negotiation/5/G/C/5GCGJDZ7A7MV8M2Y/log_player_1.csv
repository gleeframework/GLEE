"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer.  My initial offer is $900,000. This reflects the value and potential of the product. I'm open to discussing a fair price, so let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I want to explore getting closer to my desired price range before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This acknowledges the value you see in the product, but also ensures I receive a fair return. I'm confident we can finalize a deal that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $850,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price range, $775,000 is still below my minimum threshold. With 6 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and try to push for a higher price.  Selling to John now would mean leaving some money on the table, which I'm not comfortable with."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price recognizes the value of the product for you, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. This is my final offer for this round. I'm confident we can finalize a deal that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for this product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd love to get more, it's a fair price considering the value of the product to him and the fact that I can always sell to John for the same price. There are still 4 rounds left, but there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further.  It's time to secure the deal."
