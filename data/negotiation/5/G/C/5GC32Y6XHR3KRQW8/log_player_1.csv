Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than your minimum price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counter, as the product is worth more to him.  This will give you a chance to see how serious he is about buying and potentially push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will show that I am serious about getting a good price for the product, and it might encourage Bob to come closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still ensuring I earn a good amount. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not willing to drop to his initial price. This hopefully puts pressure on Bob to agree or come closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to doubt his seriousness in reaching a mutually agreeable price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
