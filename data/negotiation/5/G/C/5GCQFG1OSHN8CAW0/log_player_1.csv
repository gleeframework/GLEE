"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and where he's willing to meet me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to sell for that price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to reject his offer for now and see if we can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's fair to me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my desired value.  While I'd prefer more, it's only $5 less than my counteroffer and I'm wary of pushing too hard and risking him walking away.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
