"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I need to ensure I get a good deal for myself. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,
