{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also expresses confidence in the value of the product and uses a friendly tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still lower than my desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to $95 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer $90, Bob's offer of $87.50 is close enough to my minimum price of $80. It's also a better deal than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer."
