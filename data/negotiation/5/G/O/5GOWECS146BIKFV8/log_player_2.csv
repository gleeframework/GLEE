"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000. Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially push for a lower price.  It's still better than buying from John at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is too high, but Bob's previous offer of $12,500 was rejected.  Offering $13,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget than John's offer of $15,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price, rather than risking the chance of a deal falling through with Alice or ending up paying more to John."
