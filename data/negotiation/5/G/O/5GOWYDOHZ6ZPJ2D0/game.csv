,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is closer, but it's still just a bit below what I need. Would you consider $90? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. Would you be willing to go down to $88? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,6,
