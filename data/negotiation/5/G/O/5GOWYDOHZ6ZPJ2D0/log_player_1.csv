Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more attractive.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $100 is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum price.  This allows for back and forth negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and respond accordingly.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* If it's reasonable, I'll consider accepting.
* If the negotiation stalls or seems unproductive, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my $120 minimum price.
* **Opportunity for a higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **John is a backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me leverage to hold out for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  
* I will be willing to negotiate further if Bob's counteroffers are reasonable. 
* However, if the negotiations stall or Bob's offers remain significantly below my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $120."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering to split the difference between my last offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:** $92.50 is still above my minimum price of $120, giving me room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll sell the product for $92.50.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or move on to John. 
* If negotiations stall, I will sell to John for $120."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is closer, but it's still just a bit below what I need. Would you consider $90? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. Would you be willing to go down to $88? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations stalled:**  Bob's offer of $88 is still significantly below my minimum price of $120, and it's clear that we're not likely to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, potentially leading to even lower offers and a loss of time and energy. 
* **John offers a secure deal:**  John is willing to buy the product for $120, which is my minimum price and guarantees a profitable sale. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $120."
