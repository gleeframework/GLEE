"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good price considering its value to you. Let's find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work. Let's try $975,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and still ensure a good deal for you.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
