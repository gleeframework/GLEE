"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $775,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

This is the best option now. Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price, which is still significantly lower than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal."
