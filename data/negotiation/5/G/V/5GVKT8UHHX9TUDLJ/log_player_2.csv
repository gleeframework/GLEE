"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to an agreement! I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is a compromise between our last offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  He's already reached a point where the negotiation with Alice is getting close to his maximum budget. Since John is offering the product at his maximum budget, it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
