"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $1,200,000, and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while giving me a bit of room to maximize my earnings. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your maximum price. Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with buying from John."
