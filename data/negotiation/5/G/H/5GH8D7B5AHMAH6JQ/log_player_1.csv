Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,500,000 for the product, so anything less than that is a loss for me.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000, so anything higher is a loss for him.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves us with a negotiation space of $700,000.
* **Initial offer:**  I want to start with a price that's closer to my desired price while still being within a reasonable range for Bob. $1,400,000 is a good starting point.
* **John as backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, so I can always walk away from negotiations with Bob if they don't go my way. 

By starting with this offer, I hope to maximize my chances of securing a good price from Bob while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** Even though Bob is willing to pay only $800,000 maximum, his counteroffer indicates he is willing to negotiate. There is still room for me to secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, so I can always walk away from negotiations with Bob if they don't go my way.

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations, I have a chance to secure a better price without risking selling the product for a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000, so anything higher is a loss for him.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves us with a negotiation space of $700,000.
* **My previous offer:** I started with $1,400,000 and Bob countered with $850,000, a difference of $550,000.
* **Counteroffer:** By lowering my price to $1,200,000, I am meeting Bob halfway, closing the gap significantly while still being within my desired range. 
* **John's offer:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

This counteroffer aims to show Bob that I am serious about negotiating, and to encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob has shown his maximum willingness to pay is close to $800,000. Further negotiations are unlikely to bring me closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer guarantees my desired price:**  I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000. 

Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for the product without risking a further loss. This decision is based on the fact that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum requirement, and I have a guaranteed alternative buyer."
