"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, starting with a price closer to my own desired value leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique qualities and potential,""  I'm aiming to anchor the product's value in Bob's mind at a higher point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is a significant starting point but still allows for concessions to entice Bob while aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm losing a substantial amount.  I'll use the next round to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings is substantial.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial proposal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Understanding:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and budget concerns to build rapport and show willingness to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while holding firm to a price closer to my desired value.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I subtly reinforce the product's worth to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's still interested. However, the current offer is still below my acceptable threshold. I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've reviewed your latest offer carefully. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal through."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Flexibility:**  I want Bob to know I'm actively working towards a deal by making another concession, albeit a smaller one. 
* **Final Offer Implication:**  The phrasing ""to find a solution that works for both of us"" hints that this is nearing my bottom line, creating a sense of urgency without being explicitly aggressive.
* **Justifying the Price:** By highlighting this as a ""significant concession,"" I'm reinforcing the value I'm offering while aiming for a price point that still generates a considerable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your last offer and am willing to consider $1,085,000 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer is getting very close to a price point where further negotiation might yield diminishing returns. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could likely push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away and the remaining time in the negotiation window.  
* **Solid Profit:** Accepting $1,085,000 still provides a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price, making it a reasonable and favorable outcome."
