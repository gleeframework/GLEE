"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your own valuation.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This offer is fair and allows us both to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $11,200. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, considering our previous offers and the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal now.",10750.0,Bob,6,
