"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120, aiming for a good profit while still giving Bob a chance to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting at least $105 for the product. This gives Bob a chance to compromise, while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get him to go higher.  I'm also wary of running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for only $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John and be done with the negotiations."
