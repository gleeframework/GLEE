{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $9,500 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
