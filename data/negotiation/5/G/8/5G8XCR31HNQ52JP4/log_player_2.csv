**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to a slow negotiation tactic, likely hoping to wear you down. While you could try for one more round, it's getting risky.  She's signaled this is her ""final offer,"" and at $802,500, it's a reasonable deal. You're saving $197,500 compared to John's price.  

Waiting any longer increases the chance of Alice getting closer to her desired price, or you might be forced to buy from John anyway."
