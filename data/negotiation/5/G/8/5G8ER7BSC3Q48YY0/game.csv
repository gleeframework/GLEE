"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Can you consider it?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $8000 is below the minimum price I'm willing to consider. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in?"
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider it?",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. However, I'd like to try to get closer to the original price. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. Is that something you'd be interested in?"
"I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11500. How about $10250? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from the original price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"
"I'm making a final push to try to meet you in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to go up to $10750. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final push, but $10750 is still out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9200. Can you consider it?",9200.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I'm starting to think that we're getting nowhere, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000, and I'm starting to think that it's time to explore other options. I'm going to hold out for a better offer. But I'll give you one last chance. If you're willing to meet me at $10750, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'm going to have to look elsewhere."
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $11000, Bob. I'm not going to make any more concessions. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you've made it clear you're not willing to go below $11000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",9500.0,Bob,10,,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer,"I've made it clear that I won't go below $11000, and I'm not willing to compromise further. I think it's time to move on to other opportunities. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12000."
