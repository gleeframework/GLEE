Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm open to reasonable offers. Would you be willing to pay $150 for it?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an offer significantly higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The high price will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone even higher. If he rejects, it opens the door for counteroffers.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $100, which serves as my ""walk-away"" point. I won't accept any offers below this value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value, but it's still above my minimum. By rejecting and countering, I aim to meet somewhere in the middle and secure a higher price than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $120 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By suggesting $135, I'm splitting the difference between his offer ($120) and my previous ask ($150). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price above his initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility. If he accepts $135, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects and counters again, I'll have a better understanding of his price ceiling. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that John offers a guaranteed $100. I won't go below this price in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $135, but I'm willing to go up to $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $125 is a solid profit over my minimum ($100) and John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $125. It's not worth the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now means I secure the profit and can move on to other potential sales."
