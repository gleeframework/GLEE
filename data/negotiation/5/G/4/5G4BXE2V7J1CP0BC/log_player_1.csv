"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum threshold. This allows for some negotiation room while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $11,750. This is a fair price that takes both our interests into account. I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11750}
