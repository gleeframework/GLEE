"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the bidding at $800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I believe we can find a price that is more reasonable for both of us. Let me propose a price of $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that $700000 is a bit high. Let me propose a price of $600000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $600000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $650000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $625000. This price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $625000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with it. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one final offer: $675000. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you can understand that. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",675000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised that we're still at an impasse, Bob. I've made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any further. I'll make one last offer: $680000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",680000.0,Alice,9,
