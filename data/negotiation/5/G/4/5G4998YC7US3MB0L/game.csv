"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite high, and $900,000 is a significant drop. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 for this. Would you consider $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
