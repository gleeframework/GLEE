"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'd be willing to pay $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
