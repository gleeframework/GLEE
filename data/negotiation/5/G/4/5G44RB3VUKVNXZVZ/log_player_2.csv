"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $900,000**. This is a good price for Bob, as it's lower than what he'd pay John ($1,000,000).
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that Alice will reject and Bob will have to buy from John at a higher price.**

Accepting this offer is the most logical choice to maximize savings while still securing the product."
