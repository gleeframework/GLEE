"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is high.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1300000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1150000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for the product.  This still represents a significant value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1225000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,200,000, accepting this offer would result in a slightly higher profit. It's a good deal for me, and it avoids further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
