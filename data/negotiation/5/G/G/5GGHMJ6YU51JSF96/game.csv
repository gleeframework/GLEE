"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations.  However, $950,000 undervalues the true worth and potential this product offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price of $975,000? This would allow me to make the purchase while also respecting the value you place on the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us. However, I've received a strong offer from another buyer closer to my original asking price. I'm still open to working with you, but I need to see a significant move towards $1,000,000 to justify not pursuing this other opportunity. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
