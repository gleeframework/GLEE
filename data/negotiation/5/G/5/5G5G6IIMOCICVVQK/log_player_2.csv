"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to be aggressive but not unrealistic.  $9,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for some negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves a $500 gap between Alice's desired price and Bob's offer. This gives Alice room to counter, but it also shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
