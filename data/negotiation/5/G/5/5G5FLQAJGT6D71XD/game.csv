"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I could consider $875,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,3,
