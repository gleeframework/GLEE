"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
