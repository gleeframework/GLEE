"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $12500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13750? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
