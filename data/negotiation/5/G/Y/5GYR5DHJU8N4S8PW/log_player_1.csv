Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still earn a significant profit.  I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me leverage if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired range.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a price closer to $1 million. I have John as a backup if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility to Bob while still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob, and we can finalize the deal without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $1 million, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or even a rejection, forcing me to sell to John for $800,000.  $950,000 is a good deal and secures a significant profit. I'm going to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
