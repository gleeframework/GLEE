"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product for a price that's significantly below its market value. While I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for $1,500,000, I'm willing to make you a special offer of $1,300,000.  This price allows you a substantial profit margin while giving me a good return on my investment.  Consider this a unique opportunity to secure this asset at a competitive price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
