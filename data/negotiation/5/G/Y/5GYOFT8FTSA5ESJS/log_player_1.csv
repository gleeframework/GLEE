Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, giving me some room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  

**Why this strategy?**

* **High starting point:**  A higher starting point gives me more leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Opportunity for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects this offer, it opens the door for counteroffers and negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer (if he makes one) and then decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **Consider John's offer:** If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Selling to him at this price would be a loss for me. 

**Why I'm rejecting:**

* **Financial loss:**  $10,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price, and selling at that price would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still a significant markup from Bob's offer of $10,000, but it's a compromise from my initial $20,000 offer.

**Why this counteroffer:**

* **Middle ground:**  This price is a halfway point between my minimum value of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable selling price.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired value or if he's firmly set on a lower price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum value, so I'm not losing out financially if Bob rejects this offer.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. I'll also continue to keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  

**Why I'm rejecting:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.  I'll try to find a middle ground that balances my desire to maximize profits with the need to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is a compromise between my minimum value of $15,000 and Bob's latest offer of $13,000.

**Why this counteroffer:**

* **Almost at my minimum:**  This price is very close to my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not taking a huge loss if Bob rejects it.
* **Showing flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my previous counteroffer.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay just a bit more to close the deal.

**Next steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000.  However, if Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a price that's close to my ideal value."
