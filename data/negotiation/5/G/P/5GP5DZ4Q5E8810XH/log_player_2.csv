"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You have a significant buffer ($150,000) before you have to resort to buying from John. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for a potential better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($850,000) shows a strong intent to negotiate and potentially secure a more favorable deal.  A $700,000 offer leaves room for potential compromise and allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately resorting to the $1,000,000 price from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000, and it's only $50,000 higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might save a little more money, but the risk of Alice walking away or needing to resort to buying from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional discount."
