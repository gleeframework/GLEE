Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both our valuation and what John is offering.  We have room to negotiate.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,350,000 is still above my preferred price range, I'm willing to consider $1,100,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range, but we're still leaving money on the table. Let's try one more counter:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we settle this at $1,225,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've done some research and feel confident in offering $1,150,000. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is getting very close to John's offer, and continuing might not yield much more. It's time to make a decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While we could push for a bit more, accepting $1,150,000 is a good deal. It exceeds our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
