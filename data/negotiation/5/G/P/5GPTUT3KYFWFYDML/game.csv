"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'd be happy to consider $900000. This price still provides you with a good deal while ensuring I get a fair return on the product's value.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $950000. This is a significant concession on my part,  and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with $950000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $825000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Bob,6,
