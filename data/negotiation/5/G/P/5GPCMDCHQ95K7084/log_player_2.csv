"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $800,000 from John. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $900,000. However, I still think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's price is getting closer to his budget, but it's still above his ideal price point.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go much lower.  At this point, it's better for Bob to take the sure thing and buy from John at his desired price."
