"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $12000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair offer that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I want to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let's meet at $10500. It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you can accept it.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's meet at $10000. It's a fair price that should make both of us happy.",10000.0,Alice,7,
