Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $12,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $11,000 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair offer that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I want to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let's meet at $10500. It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, $10,500 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price. He's already in round 5, so he's getting close to his limit with Alice, but he can still try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you can accept it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's meet at $10000. It's a fair price that should make both of us happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. While he's getting closer to a deal with Alice, they're still $1,000 apart. He's already in round 7, and the pressure to close a deal is increasing.  It's risky to keep negotiating with Alice, especially since he has a guaranteed alternative with John."
