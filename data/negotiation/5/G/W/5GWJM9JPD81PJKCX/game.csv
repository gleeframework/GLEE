"Alice, $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties expressing interest in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. Is that more to your liking?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot of time and resources into this product, and $14,000 is still below my minimum. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I can do $15,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $15,500 is still more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go to $14,500. This is really the absolute maximum I can offer.  What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,7,
