"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get closer to our desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort and willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still a bit short.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a reasonable outcome. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  It's clear that further negotiation might not get you to your desired price.  It's time to lock in the guaranteed price with John and save yourself further negotiation."
