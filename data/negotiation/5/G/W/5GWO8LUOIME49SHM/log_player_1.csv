Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get closer to my ideal price point. I'm also phrasing it in a way that encourages negotiation, making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob, or if that fails, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm offering $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm also adding a sense of finality to my offer, hoping that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since John is willing to pay that price, I'll sell the product to him.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best option in this situation."
