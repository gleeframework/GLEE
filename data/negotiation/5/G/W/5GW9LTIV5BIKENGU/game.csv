"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could we work something out closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my previous one, and settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $8,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to budge a little more. Would you be willing to do it for $8,000?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept, which is $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9500.0,Alice,7,
