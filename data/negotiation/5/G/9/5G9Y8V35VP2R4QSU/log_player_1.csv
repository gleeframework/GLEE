Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategically calculated:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:** It's above his $1,000,000 valuation, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:** It's below your minimum $1,200,000, ensuring you're still making a profit. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, I'm giving Bob the impression of a potential deal while still leaving room for negotiation. This maximizes my chances of a quick sale while ensuring I don't undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? It's a win-win, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's far below my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is strategically designed:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's a significant increase from Bob's $900,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not give away my product for a huge loss.
* **Lower than my minimum:** It's still above my minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I still make a profit.

By offering a price closer to the middle ground, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm stance on my product's value. This approach increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is acceptable. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a profitable deal and above my minimum value. It would be too risky to continue negotiating and risk losing Bob altogether.  I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future who might be willing to pay more."
