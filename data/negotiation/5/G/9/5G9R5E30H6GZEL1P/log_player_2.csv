"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to pay as little as possible, and $120 is still above your ideal price.
* You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate.
* Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* It's still within your budget, but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* The message is friendly and encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still within your budget.
* She states it's her ""best price,"" suggesting further negotiation might be unproductive.
*  While you'd prefer a lower price, you've already made a counteroffer and likely won't get much lower.
* Buying from John for $150 is significantly more expensive.

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking a stalemate or paying more to John."
