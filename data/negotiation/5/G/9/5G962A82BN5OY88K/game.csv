"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $19000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us closer to what I originally had in mind.",19000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $17500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.",18500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $18500 is still a bit high. I'm thinking more along the lines of $17000. Can you consider that?",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $17000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $17500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",17500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $17500. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to make it worth it. Can you consider that?",17000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for additional value. I'm willing to include [Specific Extra or Concession] with the product for a final price of $17500.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",17500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $17500. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",16500.0,Bob,10,
