"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, but it also sets a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can likely get a better price than $18,000 by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John at this point would be less profitable than potentially reaching a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $19,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us closer to what I originally had in mind."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness to Bob, making it seem like a reasonable compromise. 
* **Maintain Target:**  This offer is still above my minimum, keeping the potential for a good deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $17500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still not desperate to sell at this point. 
* **Time Remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to try to get a slightly higher price. 
* **Risk of John:** If I sell to John now, I miss out on the potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $17,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is again a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. It demonstrates flexibility.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes ""fair price for both of us"" to highlight the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm trying to nudge the deal closer to a conclusion while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $18500 is still a bit high. I'm thinking more along the lines of $17000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is only $2,000 above my minimum, I still see room for a little more negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure, but I'm not desperate yet.
* **Potentially Higher Offer:** Bob has shown interest and willingness to negotiate, so there's still a chance he might come up a bit higher. 
* **Risk of John:** Selling to John now would be less profitable than potentially reaching a deal with Bob at a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $17,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Stating this is my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Again, I'm proposing a middle ground to show flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Risk of John:**  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of selling to John at the lower price is becoming more significant.
* **Time Pressure:**  This final offer puts the ball in Bob's court and forces him to make a decision quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $17500. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to make it worth it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 2 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is still showing interest and willing to negotiate. Even though he's asking for extras, there's still a chance he'll come up a bit higher on the price.
* **Risk of John:**  Selling to John at this point would be less profitable than potentially reaching a deal with Bob at a slightly higher price.
* **Negotiating Extras:**  In the next round, I can attempt to negotiate extras or concessions while keeping the price at $17,500. This might be more beneficial than accepting his $17,000 offer and giving away extras for free."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for additional value. I'm willing to include [Specific Extra or Concession] with the product for a final price of $17,500.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Emphasize this is your final offer to create urgency and pressure Bob to decide.
* **Specific Extra or Concession:**  Replace ""[Specific Extra or Concession]"" with something you can offer that has value to Bob without significantly impacting your profit. This could be:
    * **Free shipping:** If applicable.
    * **Extended warranty:** 
    * **Additional service:** A consultation, training, or setup.
    * **Discount on future purchase:**
* **Maintain Price:** Holding firm on $17,500 demonstrates your position but also shows flexibility by offering extras. 
* **Closing Statement:** End with a positive statement to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal.

**Important:**  The success of this counteroffer depends on the specific extra or concession you can offer. Choose something that Bob has indicated an interest in or that you know is valuable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $17500. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Up:** This is the final round, and I've exhausted my negotiating options.
* **Low Offer:**  Bob's offer of $16,500 is only $1,500 above my minimum.  
* **Risk of No Deal:**  If I reject his offer, I risk losing the deal altogether, leaving me with nothing.
* **John is the Safe Option:** While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a sale and a decent profit. It's the most prudent decision at this point."
