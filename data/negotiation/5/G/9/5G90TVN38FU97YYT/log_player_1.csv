Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $1,000,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale price).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have strong leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Framing:**  While not explicitly stating why it's worth $1,450,000, the language implies the product's value and potential, leaving room for Bob to justify the price in his mind.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Remember, any price above $1,500,000 is a win for you."
