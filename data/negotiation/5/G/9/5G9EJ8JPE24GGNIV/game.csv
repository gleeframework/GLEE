"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents the value I place on this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $13,000. Can we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
