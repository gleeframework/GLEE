# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to make a deal. I'll sell it to you for $150. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's, there's no benefit in rejecting Alice's offer. Accepting it is the most sensible choice."
