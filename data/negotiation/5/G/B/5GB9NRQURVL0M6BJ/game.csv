I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. Would you like to make an offer on this item for $15000?,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for this item. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get a better deal. I can do $12500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I can do $12200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure I want to keep negotiating, though... ",12200.0,Alice,7,
