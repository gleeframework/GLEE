"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is seriously interested. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also lets me know if he values the product much higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is already closer to my minimum than my initial offer. I'm going to reject and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, and it's higher than John's offer.  It's getting close to my target price, and I'm concerned that if I reject, we might not reach a deal in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to accept his offer."
