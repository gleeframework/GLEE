Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a good starting point.** It's lower than my minimum value but still allows me to make a profit. 
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation.** This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000.** This gives me a safety net and ensures I won't lose money if Bob rejects the offer."
