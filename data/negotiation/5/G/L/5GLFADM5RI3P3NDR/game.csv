"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room to make a deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $925,000 for the product. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
