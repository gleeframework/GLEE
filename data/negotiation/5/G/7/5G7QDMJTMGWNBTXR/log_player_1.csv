"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm providing a reason for the high price (""unique features and potential"") to make it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an invitation for Bob to respond, indicating I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** John's offer provides a safety net, but I'm not ready to take it yet as I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a compromise. How about $1,050,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Closer to Bob's Offer:** My counter-offer is closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification for the Price:**  I still justify the price by referencing the ""true value"" of the product.
* **Maintain a Position of Strength:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, showing that I'm not desperate for a deal. 
* **Continue Negotiations:**  The message invites further discussion to reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Matches John's:** Bob's offer is now equal to the price John is willing to pay.
* **No Incentive to Continue:** There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal with Bob. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a deal now. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I can guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable value without risking a potential loss or further negotiation."
