"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is substantial and $1,200,000 is below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still looking to keep the cost within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This price better aligns with my financial constraints while still recognizing the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the $1,150,000 offer is a significant departure from the value this product brings. I can go as low as $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the immense benefits you'll gain.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Alice. I've carefully considered your offers and decided to make one last counteroffer. I am willing to pay $1,175,000 for the product. This price better aligns with my budget while still reflecting the value I see in the product.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
