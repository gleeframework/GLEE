Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, creating a dialogue and potentially leading to a successful negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. He's already expressed interest in the product, indicating a potential for compromise. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $15,000 would be the most financially beneficial option right now. However, I'm willing to explore negotiation with Bob, as I could potentially reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counteroffer that's closer to his initial price point.  
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meeting in the middle"" to emphasize that I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $11,500, the product still offers him value, making it a good deal for him.
* **Finality:** I'm conveying a sense of finality by suggesting we ""finalize"" the deal, creating a sense of urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to go above $10,000 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has firmly stated his final offer at $10,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and could result in a deal that is not financially beneficial. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed and profitable transaction.  I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity for a chance at a slightly higher price from Bob."
