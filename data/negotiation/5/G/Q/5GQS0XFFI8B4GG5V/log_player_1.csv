Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high ($9,500) leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $8,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
