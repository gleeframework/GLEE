"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $105. It's the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs.",105.0,Alice,5,
