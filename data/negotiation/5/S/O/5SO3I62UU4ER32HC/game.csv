Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.,110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $90 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That would work much better for my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price.  How about this - if you're willing to come down to $80, I'll buy it right now. That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $80. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,7,
