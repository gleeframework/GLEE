"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it offers and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking for a slightly better price. I'm willing to pay $13,250 for the product. This is a fair price, given the product's value and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,6,
