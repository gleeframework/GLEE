Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John provides a safety net at $800,000, aiming high with Bob is crucial to maximizing profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $925,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) giving him a substantial saving, while still securing a significant profit for Alice (well above her minimum).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses confident language, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" of the price, subtly reinforcing the product's value."
