Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a significant premium over my minimum, but I want to see how much wiggle room I have. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to $950,000 to make this work. This product truly is exceptional, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that is significantly above my minimum, but also keeps Bob in the game. Hopefully, this counteroffer will encourage him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product, I'd like to propose $900000. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly above my minimum of $800,000 and is closer to my initial asking price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick deal and secures a good price for the product."
