"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but  $13,500 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference - how about $12,750? That's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I was thinking more like $13,250. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go.",13250.0,Alice,5,
