"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to consider a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $16250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle from here.",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $14000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",14000.0,Bob,8,
