"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1400000. I can do $1700000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $1600000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'll meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer it to you for $1650000. Is that a price you'd be willing to pay?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
