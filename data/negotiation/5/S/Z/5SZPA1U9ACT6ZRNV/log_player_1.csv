Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Value Justification:**  The message hints at high demand and value, which might make Bob more inclined to accept even if the price is above his perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer. You have a $3,000 buffer (your minimum price minus John's offer) to work with."
