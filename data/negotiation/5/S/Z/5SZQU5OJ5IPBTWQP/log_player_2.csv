"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Professional:** We want to maintain a positive relationship with Alice to encourage a deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to Alice's value ($800,000) but still leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice met us halfway, $850,000 is still significantly higher than her perceived value of the product. We have time and room to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about getting a better price and won't easily settle. 
* **John as Backup:**  We always have the option to go with John if negotiations stall, so there's limited risk in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway.  To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000 for this.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're getting closer to a critical point in the negotiation. This offer is direct and states our maximum budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" adds a bit of pressure and incentivizes Alice to accept if she's truly willing to go this low.
* **Anchoring to Her Value:** We're now at Alice's perceived value.  While she'd ideally like to make a profit, this offer might be tempting enough for her to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** Alice has come down considerably, and $825,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Time Constraint:** We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to push for a smaller discount might not be worth the risk of Alice walking away or the time it would take.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Potential Loss:** The potential savings of another round or two of negotiation ($25,000 or less) are becoming less significant compared to the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing altogether."
