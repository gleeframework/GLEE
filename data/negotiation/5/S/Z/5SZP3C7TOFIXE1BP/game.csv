"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $900,000 to reflect the true value of the product.  Let's try a compromise:  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
