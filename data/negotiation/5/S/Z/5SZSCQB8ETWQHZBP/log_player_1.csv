"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming to find a middle ground in the first round to get the negotiation going.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and consider selling to John if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I have 10 rounds and a guaranteed $15,000 sale with John, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $12,000? That's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing the price to $12,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  This is still well above Bob's offer, but closer to a potential middle ground. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the price as still favorable to Bob. I'm also acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic. 
* **Strategy:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I aim to keep the negotiation going and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy as needed, keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of your product and staying within my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I've already lowered my price from $13,000 to $12,000, showing flexibility. I have more rounds to work with and a guaranteed sale for $15,000 with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than $12,000, but still higher than Bob's current offer, to try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer! Let's split the difference - how about $11,500? That's a fair price for both of us and ensures a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $11,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's current offer of $11,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and meet halfway.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" and ""success"" of the deal to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and to encourage him to see this as a good outcome for both parties. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution in this round. By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to secure a deal that's better than Bob's current offer but still above my minimum acceptable value.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to weigh the potential of continuing to negotiate with him against the certainty of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering my budget and the value of your product, I would like to counteroffer at $11,250. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Bob's offer is $11,250, which is just $3,750 less than what I could get from John.  Considering that I have 4 rounds left and the risk of Bob walking away entirely, accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point.  It's a good deal for me, and it ensures a sale."
