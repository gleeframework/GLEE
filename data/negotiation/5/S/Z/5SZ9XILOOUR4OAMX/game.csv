"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. This represents a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product will bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,800. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit outside my ideal price point. Given the value I place on the product, I'm prepared to pay $8,500. This offer is fair and reflects the value I'm willing to invest.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $8,700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",8700.0,Alice,5,
