"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save money, and $110 is still above your maximum of $120.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a little higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 107.50? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $106.  Let's split the difference and make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at 106, but I need to make a small profit. How about we meet at 106.25? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $106.25 is still slightly above your initial goal of $120, it's the best offer Alice has given so far, and it's very close to your last counteroffer.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and save money compared to buying from John."
