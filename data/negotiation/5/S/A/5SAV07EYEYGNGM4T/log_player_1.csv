I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is still too low, but it's a good sign that Bob is interested."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}

While $9,600 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000. It's worth seeing if I can push for just a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than what I want.  Selling to John guarantees I get my desired value and avoids further negotiation."
