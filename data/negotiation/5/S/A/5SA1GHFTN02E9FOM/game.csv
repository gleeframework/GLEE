"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. I'm excited about the opportunity to work with you, but I need to make a smart financial decision.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I'm confident that this product will be a major asset for your business, and I'm eager to see you succeed. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm excited about the potential benefits it could bring to my business.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see your point, but I'm still committed to getting a price that reflects the true value of this product.  To show my willingness to find a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer. I'm sure this product will be a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
