Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that.

{""product_price"": 130}

This is my initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $150 to him, I think he's being reasonable with his offer of $125. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for that price, as it's still below my minimum value of $120.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $125, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my minimum value of $120.
