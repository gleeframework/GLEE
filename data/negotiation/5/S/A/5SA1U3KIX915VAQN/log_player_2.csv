"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $15000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $20000, which is a significant discount from its true potential value.  If you're interested, we can discuss the details further.  However, if you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. Even though she claims the product is worth more, it's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for $8,000."
