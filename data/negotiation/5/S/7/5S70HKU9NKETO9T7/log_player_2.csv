Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1000000, but I'm still looking to get a good profit from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While I'd love to get it for even less, $1,100,000 is still a good deal for me, and a better price than John's offer."
