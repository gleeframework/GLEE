Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I am still not able to justify paying more than $15,000 for it. I hope we can find a middle ground that respects both our positions.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $15,000 offer. Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to yield a better result and would waste time.  It's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
