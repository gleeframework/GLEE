"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $11,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is a fair price considering I can get it for $12,000 elsewhere.  Let's close this deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
