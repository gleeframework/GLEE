{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be very valuable to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a starting point that aims to:

* **Set a high initial price:** $1,500,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable value, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Show confidence in the product's value:**  By highlighting the product's potential, you increase its perceived value in Bob's eyes.
* **Leave the door open for negotiation:**  ""Let me know your thoughts!"" invites Bob to make a counteroffer and keeps the negotiation flowing.

Remember, this is just an initial offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the overall negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1400000? I believe we could find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable value, it's still worth trying to push for a slightly higher price. You can use this opportunity to gauge his seriousness and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,400,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Acknowledging Bob's budget constraints demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a strong position:** By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, you signal that you are still confident in the product's value.
* **Frame the counteroffer as a compromise:** ""This would be a fair price..."" positions the counteroffer as a win-win solution. 
* **Keep the negotiation open:** ""Let's see if we can find common ground..."" encourages further discussion and potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must respectfully decline at $1450000. Given my current budget, I am only able to consider offers closer to $1400000. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

```

Bob has been consistent in his offer of $1,400,000, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that meets your minimum acceptable value and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
