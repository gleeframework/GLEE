"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is truly invaluable to you. Given its immense worth to you at $1,500,000 and my understanding of its significance, I propose to offer it to you at a carefully considered price that aims to reflect its true value while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.

I am proposing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price not only acknowledges the product's substantial worth but also provides a reasonable margin for me, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you would like to proceed with the purchase. I am more than happy to discuss any concerns or further details you might have regarding the transaction.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase from John at a lower price."
