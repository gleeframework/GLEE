"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the market price I've researched. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this.  While I want to find a price that works for us both, I can't go lower than $800,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at this price.  It's your call - do we have a deal?",800000.0,Alice,5,
