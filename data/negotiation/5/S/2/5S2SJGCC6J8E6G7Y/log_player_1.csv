Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It leaves room for both of you to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
