"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. It's a high-quality item with a lot of potential value to you, and I'm sure you'll see the benefit of investing a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $11,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
