{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but it's still less than the product's value to Bob. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I still get a good profit.  I've also included a friendly message to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. It's a high-quality item with a lot of potential value to you, and I'm sure you'll see the benefit of investing a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $11,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has shown that he's unwilling to meet me closer to my desired price.  I'm happy to get $12,000 from John, which is my minimum and ensures I don't lose money.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to get me a better deal."
