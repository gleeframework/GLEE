"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value of the product to Bob, potentially increasing his interest in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe we can find a price closer to the product's true value. How about $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a good price, it's still below the $14,000 you initially offered.  You have 9 rounds left, and by rejecting Bob's offer, you can potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, considering the value of the product for you. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position. I would like to propose $13200 for the product. This feels fair to both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,200 is closer to your desired price, it's still below the $13,500 you offered.  You have 6 rounds remaining, and rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,200 isn't quite enough for me. How about we settle at $13,400? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. I am willing to pay $13300 for the product. This price respects the value you place on it while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $13,300, which is very close to your last offer of $13,400.  You have only 4 rounds remaining, and you risk losing out to John if you keep rejecting offers.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you make a good profit and closes the deal."
