Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and focuses on the potential value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping Bob will accept my initial offer without too much negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I won't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $15,000 and even significantly lower than my initial offer.  While I want to secure a sale, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. I will keep in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000, but I'll also need to be reasonable and consider Bob's willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000** is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer and still a good deal for Bob, considering he values it at $8,000.
* The message is friendly and reiterates the value of the product while offering a reasonable counter-offer. 
* I hope this will lead to a quick agreement without further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still maintaining a profitable price for myself. 
* If Bob rejects again, I might consider a slightly lower counter-offer, but I'll be prepared to sell to John at $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000, it's a much better offer than Bob's previous $5,000.  Considering that:

* I've already rejected a counter-offer and made a counter-offer myself.
* Further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price.
* I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000.

Accepting Bob's offer at $7,000 will secure a sale and ensure a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for.  It's a good compromise, and I can use the experience to refine my negotiation strategies in the future."
