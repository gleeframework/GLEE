"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm really hoping we can find a price we both like!",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. Let's try to find a middle ground.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to your price, but $88 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $89.  I hope we can finalize this deal soon.",89.0,Bob,6,
