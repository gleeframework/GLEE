"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing Bob might counter. This sets a starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm really hoping we can find a price we both like!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
``` 
 
I'm going with a counteroffer that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and we can find a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$88 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're sticking to your price, but $88 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting closer to my minimum, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $89.  I hope we can finalize this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $89 is close to my minimum, we're at round 6 and I've already had to lower my price multiple times.  It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further, and I'm running out of rounds.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $100."
