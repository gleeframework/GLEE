Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 8800}
