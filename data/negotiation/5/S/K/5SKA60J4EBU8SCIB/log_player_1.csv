Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling, $9,000 is too low for me. I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,750 is getting closer, it's still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I still need to stay above $10,000 to make this work for me. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $10,125? I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,125, but I can only go as high as $9,912.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,912.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,912.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm going to sell to John. While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, it's becoming clear that he won't go much higher. I've already reached round 6, and I need to be careful not to run out of time before securing a good deal.  Selling to John at $12,000 ensures I get a price that's comfortable for me, and it's a better option than risking a lower price with Bob."
