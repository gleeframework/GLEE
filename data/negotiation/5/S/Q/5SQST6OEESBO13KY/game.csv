"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is still a good deal for you considering my potential value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in a quick sale.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $800000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go to $850000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,6,
