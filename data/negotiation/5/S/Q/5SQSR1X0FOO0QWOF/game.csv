"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
