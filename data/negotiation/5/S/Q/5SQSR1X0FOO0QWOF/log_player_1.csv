Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
