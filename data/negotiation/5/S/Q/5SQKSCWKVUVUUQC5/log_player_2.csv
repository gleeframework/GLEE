"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $13,000 is lower than the $15,000 that John is selling for. 
* **Negotiating further might be risky:** While Bob could try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept.  She's already moved from $14,000 to $13,000, showing some flexibility. 
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $13,000 is the most logical choice.  It saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
