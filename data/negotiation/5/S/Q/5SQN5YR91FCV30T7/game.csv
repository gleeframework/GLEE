"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm not quite there yet.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
