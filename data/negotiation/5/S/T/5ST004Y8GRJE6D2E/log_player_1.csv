Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the price. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet the minimum price of $1,500,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would be a loss.  Selling to John guarantees we get our minimum acceptable price."
