"Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the price. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
