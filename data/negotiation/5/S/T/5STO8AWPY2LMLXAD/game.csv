"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?  That's the very top of what I can afford.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $12,000, so I'll offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer in this range, so I hope you can meet me here.",10000.0,Alice,5,
