Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is above my minimum value of $120, giving me some room to negotiate. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm starting high to see if I can get a good deal.  I'll be ready to adjust my price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This gives me a chance to get closer to my desired price without risking losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept his offer."
