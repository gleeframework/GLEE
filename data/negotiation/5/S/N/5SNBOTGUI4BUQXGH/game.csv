"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we try $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
