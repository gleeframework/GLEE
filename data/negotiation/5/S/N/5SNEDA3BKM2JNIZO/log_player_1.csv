Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob, given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. I want to leave room for negotiation, but also try to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to try to get closer to my initial asking price, but if the negotiation doesn't yield a better result, I'm willing to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to sell the product to him for $1,500,000.  While I initially hoped for a higher price, I'm satisfied with this outcome.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation would result in a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
