You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further price reductions.  It's still possible to reach a price you're comfortable with or simply buy from John if you believe further negotiation is unlikely to be successful."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is your final attempt to reach a price you're comfortable with while still potentially saving money. It offers the maximum amount you're willing to pay for the product, which aligns with John's offer. If Alice accepts, you achieve your goal of saving some money. If Alice rejects, you can move forward and buy the product from John without further negotiation."
