"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is a little too far out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the current market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $950,000 is really pushing my budget limits. To be completely transparent, I do have another option for $800,000.  However, I believe your product is superior, and I'd prefer to work something out with you if possible.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your other option, Bob. I'm glad you think our product is superior. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've acknowledged the product brings. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you understanding my budget constraints.  Would you be willing to settle at $810,000?  If so, I can close the deal today.",810000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I think $810,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $810,000. I'll compromise at $820,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",820000.0,Alice,9,
