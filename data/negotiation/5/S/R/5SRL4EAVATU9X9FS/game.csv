"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me a good profit as well. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers at or below $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your efforts in negotiating. I've considered your latest offer of $1,275,000, and while it's closer to my budget, I'm still not able to commit to that price. I would like to propose $1,260,000 as a final counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
