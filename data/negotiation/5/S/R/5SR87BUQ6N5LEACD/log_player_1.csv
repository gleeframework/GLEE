Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price. How does $130 sound?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $150, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $80.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $130 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $80 if Bob refuses. This knowledge empowers me to aim higher with Bob."
