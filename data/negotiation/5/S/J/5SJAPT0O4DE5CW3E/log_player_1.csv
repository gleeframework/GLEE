(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I can still try to get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about $10,500? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to propose $10200 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,200 is very close to my minimum and a decent compromise. Accepting this offer is the best course of action at this stage."
