Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a stretch for you.

I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's willing to compromise, it's still above your budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to balance the value of the product with your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get closer to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer it to you for $1100000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget constraints.

Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with.  It's better to buy from John at this point, even though it's a bit of a disappointment to not get the product from Alice. You've already negotiated as much as you can, and you don't want to risk going over your budget."
