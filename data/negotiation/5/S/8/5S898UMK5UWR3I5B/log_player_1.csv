Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I can adjust my strategy further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's a good deal considering he initially offered a lower price and I've already made concessions. It's worth accepting his offer and closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation with the potential for a lower offer or a breakdown in negotiations."
