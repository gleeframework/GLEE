"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, you open the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a price closer to your desired range.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $8,000 (Alice's value) and $15,000 (your maximum)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. While you'd prefer a lower price, $11,000 is still within your budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a further counteroffer, and you could end up with a worse outcome or even lose the deal completely. 

**Conclusion:**

At this point, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
