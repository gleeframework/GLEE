Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $10,000.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high with Bob, knowing you have a fallback option. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering what you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while aiming closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" subtly reminds Bob why he's willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:** Framing the price as fair encourages Bob to engage constructively.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to slightly lower your price, but don't go below $10,500 (leaving some profit margin).
* **Confidence is Key:**  Present your offer confidently.  If Bob senses hesitation, he might push for a lower price."
