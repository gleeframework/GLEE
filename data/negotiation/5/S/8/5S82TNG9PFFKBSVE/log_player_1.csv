Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $9,000?** This is a strategic starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.  It also signals that I value the product highly.
* **The Risk:**  Bob might reject the offer. However, I have a guaranteed fallback option with John, ensuring I won't lose money. 
* **The Potential:**  If Bob is willing to pay more than $8,000, this offer gives me the opportunity to maximize my profit. 

By starting high and having a backup plan, I'm setting myself up for a potentially successful negotiation with Bob."
