"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make the purchase.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a good balance between what you're willing to pay and my minimum requirement. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,062,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us, don't you think?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,062,500. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. Let's try $1,087,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",1087500.0,Alice,7,
