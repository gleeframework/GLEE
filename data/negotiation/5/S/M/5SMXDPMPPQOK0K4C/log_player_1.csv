Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. My offer needs to be enticing but also profitable for me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price between $800,000 and $950,000. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing my potential profit."
