"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $85? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $87.50. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is still a good deal for you.  While you might be able to squeeze out another dollar or two, it's likely not worth the risk of further negotiation. At this point, it's better to secure the deal and save yourself $12.50 compared to buying from John."
