"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $11,500 is closer to your goal, it's still above your limit. Buying from John guarantees the product for your target price, and you can avoid any further negotiation."
