It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on her response."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a lower price than $1,050,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and I might be able to secure a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping it below $1,000,000.  I want to see if Alice is willing to move closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now closer to my desired price range.  While I'd like to continue negotiating, it's getting closer to the 10-round limit.  At this point, accepting the offer secures the product for a decent price, avoiding the risk of running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
