Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below your minimum ($15,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, which could make Bob more receptive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard price, but leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Remember:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000, so I don't need to accept a low offer. I'm aiming for the highest possible price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant discount to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target.  I'll need to strike a balance between being firm on my value and staying open to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  This would still be a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to negotiate by offering a price closer to his offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a good deal for both of us.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $11,750 is still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

**Why I'm not accepting Bob's offer:**

While I'm open to negotiation, selling for $10,500 is too far below my minimum value of $15,000. This counteroffer keeps me in the negotiation without compromising too much on my desired price."
