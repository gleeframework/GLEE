"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  This would still be a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",11750.0,Alice,3,
