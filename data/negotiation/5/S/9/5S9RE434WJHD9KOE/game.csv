"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite far from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
