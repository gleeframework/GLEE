Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $9,999 might seem too greedy and could make Bob less likely to accept. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and Alice having to sell to John for $8,000."
