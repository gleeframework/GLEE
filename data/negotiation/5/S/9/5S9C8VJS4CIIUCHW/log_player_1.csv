Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. My initial price is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the product's value to me and leaves room for negotiation. I'm willing to explore a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $800,000 is too far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's try $1,050,000.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that's more advantageous."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer. How about we settle at $987,500? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 987500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below the product's true value to me. With five rounds remaining, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price and avoid selling to John. I'll continue to explore a counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $975,000.
