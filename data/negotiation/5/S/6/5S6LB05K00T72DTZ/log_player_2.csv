"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $15,000, and I know it's worth the same to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a slightly higher return. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
