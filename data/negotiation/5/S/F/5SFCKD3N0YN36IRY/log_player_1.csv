Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept the offer. It also allows me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better offer. There's a good chance that Bob will be willing to increase his offer if he sees that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal of $12,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, but still maintaining a firm stance. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of your product, I am still looking for the best deal. I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my goal of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,600 is a good compromise.  It's only slightly less than my counteroffer and is a decent profit considering the value of the product to Bob.  It's more beneficial to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation, as he might not be willing to go higher."
