Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering it to me. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my original price and settle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so how about we try $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Bob is nowhere near my minimum price and is unlikely to budge much higher. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $120 from John."
