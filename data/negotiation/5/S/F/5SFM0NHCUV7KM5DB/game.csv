"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering it to me. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my original price and settle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so how about we try $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
