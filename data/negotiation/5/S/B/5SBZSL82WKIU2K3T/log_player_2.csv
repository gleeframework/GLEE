"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get the price closer to his target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, and his maximum budget is $12,000.  He's starting with a counteroffer slightly above his budget to see if Alice is willing to compromise. This offer leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer of $14,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice could raise the price again, potentially making it less appealing than buying from John. Accepting Alice's offer at this point ensures a good deal within Bob's budget."
