# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is willing to sell the product for $120, which is your maximum value, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product at the same price from John."
