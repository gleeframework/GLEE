"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to sell this product. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling for $1,200,000. This price still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
