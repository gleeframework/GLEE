I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I need to find a price that is both fair to me and that Bob might be willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, it's a price that Bob might be willing to consider, given that he rejected my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum. I'll make another counteroffer. I'm trying to see if I can get a better price than John's offer, but I need to be careful not to push Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've made several concessions, and it seems like he's not willing to go much higher. I don't want to risk going through more rounds and losing more time, so I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's not the highest price, but it's still above my minimum and a guaranteed sale."
