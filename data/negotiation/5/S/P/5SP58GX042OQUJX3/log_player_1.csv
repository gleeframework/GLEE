"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the potential benefit for both of us. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I need to push for a better deal. 

* **Rejecting Now:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  This rejection shows Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Strategic Decision:** This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm  countering Bob's offer, but I'm not going all the way down to his price. 
* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm again emphasizing the idea of a fair price that benefits both of us.
* **Pressure:** By being willing to come down a bit, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm not desperate to sell at this price, and I believe I can push for a higher value.

* **Rejecting Now:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage and keeps the negotiation going.
* **Strategic Decision:** This allows me to continue seeking a better price without rushing into a deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to $10,000 or even $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference again.  $9,250 is my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making this offer my ""final offer"" to signal that I'm serious about getting a deal done but also to create some pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing to split the difference between our last offers, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Confidence and Closing:**  I'm expressing confidence in the deal and emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both sides to encourage acceptance. 

This approach balances a desire for a higher price with the need to reach an agreement before the negotiation window closes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence as well, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though we are nearing the end of the negotiations, $8,875 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell for a price that doesn't meet my minimum threshold.

* **Rejecting Now:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as it doesn't meet my minimum price requirement.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer. 
* **Strategic Decision:**  I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't improve his offer.  This allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers one last time. How about $9,062.50?  That's the best I can do.  If you can't accept this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9062.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making one final compromise to show my willingness to work with Bob, but I'm drawing a line in the sand.
* **Pressuring Bob:** I'm explicitly stating that I have other options (John) if this price isn't acceptable, creating pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This approach shows that I am still willing to negotiate, but I am firmly standing by my minimum acceptable price.

This approach is designed to signal that this is my final offer, while also keeping the door open for a potential deal before having to fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,062.50. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $8,900 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we won't reach an agreement before the deadline.

* **Time is Limited:**  The negotiation is nearing its end, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which significantly exceeds Bob's current offer. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By selling to John, I secure the highest possible price and avoid the risk of a lower price or no deal with Bob.

It's a strategic decision to secure the best possible outcome, even if it means walking away from Bob's negotiation."
