"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference again.  $9,250 is my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence as well, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about $8,875?",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers one last time. How about $9,062.50?  That's the best I can do.  If you can't accept this price, I'll have to explore other options.",9062.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,062.50. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",8900.0,Bob,8,
