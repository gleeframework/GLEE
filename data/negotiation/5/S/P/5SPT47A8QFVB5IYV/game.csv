"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the product's value to you, I believe we can find a middle ground.  Let's meet at $850,000. This price still gives you a substantial return on your investment, and it allows me to recoup a fair portion of the product's value.  I'm open to further discussion if you have other proposals.",850000.0,Alice,3,
