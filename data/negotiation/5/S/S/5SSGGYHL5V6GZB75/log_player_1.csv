Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm getting more than my minimum. I've also made the message friendly and open to negotiation, which may make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum of $120. I'm not going to sell for less than that, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to work with you, but I need to be closer to $120 to make this worthwhile. How about $115?  I'm feeling flexible here."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $115, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a profit margin.  I'm also keeping the message positive and emphasizing flexibility to encourage Bob to agree."
