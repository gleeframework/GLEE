{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $135. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** You want to earn as much as possible, so starting above Bob's perceived value ($120) is key.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $135 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $150 gives you leverage. You don't need to go below your minimum.

This offer aims to find a balance between attracting Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
