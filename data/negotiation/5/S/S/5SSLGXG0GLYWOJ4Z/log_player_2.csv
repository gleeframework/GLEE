"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is a decent price and lower than Alice's perceived value, there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant jump from Alice's initial offer, aiming to gauge her flexibility. By starting lower, we leave room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of your $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, but you're still better off buying from John for $10,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to meet your price point, so it's worth one more counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  To be totally honest, my budget is capped at $10,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to make the deal right now."",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer makes it clear that $10,000 is your absolute limit. It also introduces a sense of urgency and willingness to commit if Alice agrees, potentially influencing her to accept rather than risk losing the sale."
