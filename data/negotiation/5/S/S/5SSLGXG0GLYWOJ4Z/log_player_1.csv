Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product and leaving the door open for further discussion. 

This strategy is designed to:

* **Start high:**  I want to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By not going too high, I can adjust the price if needed to avoid losing the deal.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** Building a rapport with Bob is important, especially if we need to go through multiple rounds of negotiation.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'm prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much. 

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round. This allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can propose a price closer to my desired range, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary.

Selling to John right now is tempting, but I want to see if I can secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to negotiate. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the price as a ""great deal."" 

By taking this approach, I aim to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  $10,500 is a more reasonable price point for both of us.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm trying to keep the negotiation friendly and constructive.
* **Avoid a stalemate:**  I believe this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted than Bob's initial offer. 

However, I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to re-evaluate my options and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  To be totally honest, my budget is capped at $10,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to make the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, but ultimately, I'm choosing to **AcceptOffer**. Here's why:

* **Bob's Budget:**  It's clear that Bob's budget is firm at $10,000.  Further negotiation might be futile.
* **John's Offer:**  While $15,000 is the ideal outcome, it comes with the risk that John might back out or change his mind.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and secures a price that's closer to my minimum than my initial offer. 

While $10,000 is less than I originally hoped for, it's still a respectable profit, and it's the most reasonable outcome based on the current situation."
