,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $150 represents my ideal price, I understand your budget might be a little tighter. How about we meet halfway and settle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my $80 budget.  Would you consider coming down to $90?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $90.  The lowest I can go is $105.  This is a very fair offer considering the value you're getting.",105.0,Alice,5,
