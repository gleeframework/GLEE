"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  I'm sure you'll agree that this price is fair, considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this is a fair compromise and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price of $800,000. You still have room to counteroffer without reaching your maximum limit, and you might be able to convince Alice to go lower."
