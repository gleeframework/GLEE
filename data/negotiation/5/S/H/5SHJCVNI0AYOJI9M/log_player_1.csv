Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 allows some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it for a price too close to $100 (like $98 or $99) risks Bob rejecting the offer and leaving you with the guaranteed $80 from John. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
