"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's room for both parties to make a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is tempting, I'm looking to get the best deal possible. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $12000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still within Bob's budget:**  $13,000 is below Bob's maximum price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, Alice has already lowered her price.  There's a risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Saving money is key:**  Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or getting stuck with a higher price from John makes accepting Alice's offer the most logical choice at this point."
