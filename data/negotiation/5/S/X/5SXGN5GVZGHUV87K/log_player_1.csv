Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired price of $800,000. It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I don't have to accept any offer that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more enticing price point for Bob, and we can settle somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my initial asking price.  It's also better than selling to John for $800,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob could get frustrated and walk away, or that I could end up getting a lower offer than this.  It's best to secure a deal that's favorable to me while it's available."
