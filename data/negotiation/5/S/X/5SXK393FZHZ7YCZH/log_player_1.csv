Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know what you think, as I'm eager to see this product put to good use."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away price:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so you should never sell for less.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. You want to aim for a price significantly higher than this, while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Starting high:** A starting price of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive messaging:** The message emphasizes value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still providing an offer that could be attractive to Bob."
