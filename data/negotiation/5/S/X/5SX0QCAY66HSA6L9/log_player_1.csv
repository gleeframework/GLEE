Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
