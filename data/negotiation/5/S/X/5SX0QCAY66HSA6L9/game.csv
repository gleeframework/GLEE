"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of its worth.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,112,500?",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'll propose $1,087,500. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while still acknowledging the inherent value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
