"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable outcome. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a final offer, as I'm confident the product is worth this to you. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
