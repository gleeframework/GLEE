"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still quite a bit more than Alice's minimum.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum of $800,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate.  It's a reasonable starting point that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and it's not yet worth going to John for a higher price. Bob should try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, but it's closer to her minimum. This is a strategy to hopefully push Alice towards a more acceptable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still too high. There are only 5 rounds left, and Bob needs to be strategic. By rejecting, he can try to get a better deal without risking being stuck with John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's still lower than Alice's latest offer, but it's getting closer to the middle ground. With fewer rounds left, Bob needs to make a more substantial move to potentially get a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, Alice's offer is very close to John's price. If Bob rejects, there's a high chance he won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, and he'll have to buy from John at a higher price. Buying from John now guarantees the product at a slightly higher cost, but it removes the risk of ending up with a worse deal."
