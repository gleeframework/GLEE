Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90. Let me know if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. I am still not able to go above $90 for this product. Is there any way we could reach a mutual agreement within my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge past $90.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking a worse offer or missing out on John's guaranteed $100."
