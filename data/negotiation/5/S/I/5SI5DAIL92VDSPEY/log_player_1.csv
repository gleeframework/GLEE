Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special price of $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""significant value"" and even mentioning that it exceeds Bob's own estimate, you aim to justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it doesn't completely price Bob out. It leaves space for him to counter-offer, leading to a potential compromise.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't have a pressing need to sell the product immediately. You are willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John. 
* This approach aims to maximize profit but could result in Bob walking away. It's crucial to assess Bob's potential negotiating style and risk tolerance beforehand."
