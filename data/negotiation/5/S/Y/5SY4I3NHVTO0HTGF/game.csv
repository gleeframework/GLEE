"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's find some middle ground.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about $11,500? That's a good compromise, and it's still a great price for the value you'll be getting. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to get a good price, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $11,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,200 is getting closer to where I need to be. How about we split the difference?  $11,350 would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",11350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $11,350 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",11250.0,Bob,8,
