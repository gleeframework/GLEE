"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasize the value to Bob. 
* **First Round:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay without risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product. This gives me leverage to negotiate further.
* **Time to Counter:** I still have 8 rounds left. I can use this opportunity to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's find some middle ground.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a counter-offer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I value the product.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to remind him of the potential benefits.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and focusing on finding a solution.  
* **Room for More Rounds:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still below my desired outcome.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I still have several rounds remaining. I can use this time to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still potential to secure a price closer to $12,000 or even higher with further negotiation.

**Note:** I'm not rushing to accept Bob's offer because I still have time and the option to sell to John for a much higher price. The goal is to maximize my profit, and accepting a mediocre offer could mean missing out on a better opportunity."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about $11,500? That's a good compromise, and it's still a great price for the value you'll be getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the price from the previous round, but only by a small amount. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to drastically lower my price.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise and emphasizing the value Bob will be receiving. 
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I still have plenty of rounds left, so I'm not rushing to accept any offer that's too low. 
* **Building Momentum:** Each counteroffer brings us closer to a deal. The goal is to maintain a positive, collaborative negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still trying to get a good price, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $11,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Target:** Bob's offer is still below my target price of $12,000, although it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for improvement in the negotiation. I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm willing to take a calculated risk and see if I can get a slightly better price from Bob. The potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of losing the deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,200 is getting closer to where I need to be. How about we split the difference?  $11,350 would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Agreement:**  Bob's offer is within $150 of my target. It's a good opportunity to strike a deal while still maintaining a positive negotiation tone.
* **Final Offer Approach:** This counteroffer is presented as a final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering to split the difference shows a willingness to compromise and can make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Finalizing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a deal to be finalized, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $11,350 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds left. 
* **Small Difference:** Bob's offer is only $100 away from my previous counteroffer, indicating that we're very close to an agreement. However, it's still below my desired price and the risk of not reaching a deal is increasing. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** The potential gain from a few more rounds of negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a much higher profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time remaining and the opportunity to sell to John for a significantly higher price, it's the most rational decision to sell the product to John."
