"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to meet you halfway.  This is still a great deal considering the product's potential, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
