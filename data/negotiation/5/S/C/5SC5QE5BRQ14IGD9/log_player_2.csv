"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal $8,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his maximum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $8,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, forcing him to either buy from John or risk losing out on the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids any further negotiation risks."
