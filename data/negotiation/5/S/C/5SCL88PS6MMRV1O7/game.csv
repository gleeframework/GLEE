"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $11750.  This price still leaves some room for me to profit, but also gives you a significant discount from your initial offer. Let's meet in the middle!",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $11600? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11600.0,Bob,4,
