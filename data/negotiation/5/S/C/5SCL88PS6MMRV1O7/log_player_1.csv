Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I know it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You haven't pushed for the full $12,000, leaving space for a potential counteroffer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $12000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly at his perceived value of the product, which means there's no room for me to negotiate a higher price. However, I believe I can still get a better deal than $10,000 from John by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  This price still leaves some room for me to profit, but also gives you a significant discount from your initial offer. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

This counteroffer balances a few things:

* **Meeting in the middle:** It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** It's still above my minimum, so I can potentially go lower if needed.
* **Signaling flexibility:** It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $11600? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $11,750, Bob's offer of $11,600 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than what I could get from John, and it's only a small difference from my last counteroffer.  Accepting this offer ensures I secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a complete deal collapse."
