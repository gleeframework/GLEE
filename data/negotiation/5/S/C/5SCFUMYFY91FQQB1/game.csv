"Alice, your initial price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product, as that's my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm hoping you'll reconsider.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a living. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a minimum of $18000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $12000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $10000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a reasonable price, but I'm still limited to my budget. I'm willing to offer $11000. This is my final offer, and I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
