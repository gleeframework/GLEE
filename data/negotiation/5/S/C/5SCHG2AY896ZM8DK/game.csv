"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still offers you a good value, and it's closer to my ideal price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the compromise, but I am still unable to meet you at $13,500. I would like to propose $12,500 as a counteroffer. I hope this proposal works for you.",12500.0,Bob,4,
