Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" for both of us aims to create a collaborative tone and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $1,200,000? I hope this suggestion aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is still a good profit for me, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for negotiation in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity to improve:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I can potentially earn more by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a significant profit, and it allows me to make a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with explanation:**  I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer; I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer and suggesting a compromise. 
* **Moderate reduction:** I'm reducing my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the profit Bob can still make at the proposed price, keeping the negotiation collaborative.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob for his feedback to keep the dialogue open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair balance between our interests.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** We're getting closer with each round, and I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to $1,300,000. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John at this point would mean losing a substantial amount of potential profit."

Round 5

```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  $1,260,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,265,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1265000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small counter-offer:**  I'm only increasing the price by $5,000, showing that I'm willing to make concessions but not give in too easily.
* **Focus on fairness:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""walk away feeling good"" emphasizes the shared benefit and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Closing the deal:**  This counteroffer signals my willingness to come to a mutually agreeable solution and increases the likelihood of a deal in the next few rounds. 
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""What do you say?"" keeps the conversation open and prompts a response from Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's aim for a price that is acceptable to both parties. I propose $1,262,500 for the product. This offers a slight compromise and could be seen as a win-win situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  $1,262,500 is only $2,500 less than my last counteroffer, which was already a compromise.
* **Limited time:** With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away or make a counteroffer that's even lower. 
* **Guarantee a good profit:**  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, this offer still ensures a significant profit and guarantees a sale."
