"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try $1350000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet somewhere in between?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1300000. Let's try $1290000. It's a bit above your last offer, but it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1290000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1225000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1280000. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, which would be $1260000. It's a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1260000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better than that. Let's try $1200000. It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1220000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price for the product's value and my investment.",1220000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1220000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1180000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on this price.",1180000.0,Bob,10,
