"I understand you're interested in the product, but $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I need to be mindful of my budget. Could you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is my best and final offer for now. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm open to hearing your next move.",850000.0,Alice,5,
