"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant saving compared to what it's worth to you, and allows me to earn a decent profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
