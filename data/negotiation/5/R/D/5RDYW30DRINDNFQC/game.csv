"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This allows me to consider the product without exceeding my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,025,000? This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, I still feel that we might be able to find a price that suits both of us better. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This price is still below your original asking price but closer to what I am comfortable with financially.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
