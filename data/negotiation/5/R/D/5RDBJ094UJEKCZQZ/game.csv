"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my investment in it. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,850,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers, say $1,425,000?",1425000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I want to find a way for us to make this work.  How about we settle at $1,625,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come up a little bit.  How about $1,500,000, and we have a deal?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
