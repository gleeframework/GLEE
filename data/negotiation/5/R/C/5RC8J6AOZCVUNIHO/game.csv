"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefit you'll gain, I think a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives you a good return as well.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $14,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $13,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still staying within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,6,
