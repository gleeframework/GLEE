Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** Bob can offer a price closer to his perceived value, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 

I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also willing to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I need to try and get closer to my desired price, and I believe I can. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,750. How about we try $10,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, Bob's offer of $10,125 is pretty close to my minimum.  I'm willing to take the deal, as it's likely we won't get closer and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
