"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always best to explore options and try to negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really keen on this product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you're still willing to try and negotiate a lower price. It's important to remember that you have a fallback option with John, so you don't have to settle for a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you're still not at your ideal price point. You're also not ready to give up on the negotiation just yet.  You have a few more rounds to go, and there's still room for Alice to budge further. You also have the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit too much for me. Let's try $110. I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112.50. That's as low as I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112.50, which is very close to your desired price. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more. Given that you have a few rounds left and your fallback option with John is $120, accepting this offer is the best option to save money."
