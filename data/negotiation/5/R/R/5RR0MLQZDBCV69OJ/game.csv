"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really keen on this product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This would be a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit too much for me. Let's try $110. I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112.50. That's as low as I can go and still make it worth my while.",112.5,Alice,7,
