Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. I believe it holds significant value, but for you, I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below its value to you ($11,500) makes it tempting for Bob. He gets a good deal compared to its perceived worth of $8,000 to him. 
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept before you move on to John.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your profit."
