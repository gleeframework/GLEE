Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I believe this product is worth more due to [mention a key feature or benefit]. Could we meet halfway at $11,250?"", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value of the product's key feature, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $9,750. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk Bob's offers decreasing further."
