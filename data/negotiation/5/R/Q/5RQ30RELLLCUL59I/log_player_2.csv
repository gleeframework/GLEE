Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it.

You can still do better than $1,050,000.  Rejecting the offer will give you another opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested in the product, I'm still working within a budget.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to offer $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the value you see in the product and your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is closer to your last offer. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You've successfully negotiated the price down from $1,000,000 to $980,000, which is a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing you to buy from John for a higher price is too high."
