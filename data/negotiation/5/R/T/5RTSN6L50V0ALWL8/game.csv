"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you consider $9500? ",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to accept $10500?  That's a significant reduction from your last offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though. I'll sell the product to you for $11200. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
