"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes my price point clearly and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal."
