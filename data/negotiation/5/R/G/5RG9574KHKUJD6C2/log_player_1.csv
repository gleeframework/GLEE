Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay that much, and I'm willing to sell. I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer:
