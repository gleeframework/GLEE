{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. You can make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the lowest possible price I'm willing to pay, which is the price John is offering. This establishes a baseline and shows Alice that I'm serious about saving money. It's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, making it more likely she'll at least consider it."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get the price even lower. There's still room for her to come down, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but it's still a bit high.  I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but still within my budget. I'm hoping to split the difference and reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is getting closer to the price I want to pay. Accepting this offer will save me $100,000 compared to buying from John. While I might be able to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John at the higher price outweighs the potential savings. It's a good compromise that gets me the product at a price I can afford."
