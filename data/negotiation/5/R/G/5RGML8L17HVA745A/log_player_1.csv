Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately giving away too much value. I'm also leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm rejecting it and will counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

I'm lowering my price a bit to show willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it significantly above Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to continue negotiating but will need to see a higher price to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm making a final concession to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob is likely to find it appealing. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
