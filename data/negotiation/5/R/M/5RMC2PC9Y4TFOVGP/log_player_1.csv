Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I'll make a decent profit. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my counteroffer and a good deal for me.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000 and a decent profit.  I'll accept his offer."
