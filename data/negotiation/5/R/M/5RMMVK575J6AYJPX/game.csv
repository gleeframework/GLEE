"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, Alice.  However, I'm still aiming to stay under $1,300,000. Would you consider $1,325,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable enough to make it worth the investment.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
