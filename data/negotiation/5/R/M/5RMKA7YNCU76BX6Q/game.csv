"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
