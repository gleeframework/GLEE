``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still attractive to Bob.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than $8,000 from John, so I'm willing to take the risk of negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm confident that I can still get closer to my desired price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $9500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $8500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John for $8,000 yet. I'll counteroffer again."
