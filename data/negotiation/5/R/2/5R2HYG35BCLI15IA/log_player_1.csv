Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If Bob accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to get $1,500,000, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll use this round to gauge his seriousness and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it's still well above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my initial asking price and still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
