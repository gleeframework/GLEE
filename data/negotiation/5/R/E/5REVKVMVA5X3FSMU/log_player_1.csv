Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate with Bob. Let's counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget, but the value this product brings is substantial.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on a price of $1,275,000?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Strong position:** We're still comfortably above John's fallback offer of $800,000, giving us negotiating power.
* **Splitting the difference:** By suggesting $1,275,000, we're showing flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong price. 
* **Reasoning:**  We're not just throwing out numbers, we're reiterating the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this suggestion will be more favorable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent profit:**  $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin over our minimum ($800,000) and a good deal overall.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we *might* be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, there's always the risk he walks away with each counteroffer. Accepting now secures a strong profit. 
* **Time Value:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more opportunity cost we incur. Accepting a good offer now allows us to move on to other potential deals."
