"Alice, your offer of $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I see the potential value in your product, I'm only willing to pay up to $800000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the fact that I can purchase a similar product from another seller for that amount. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This price still reflects the product's true value, and it gives you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the fact that I have other options.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
