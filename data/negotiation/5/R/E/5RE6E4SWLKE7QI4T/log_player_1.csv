Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer of $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I see the potential value in your product, I'm only willing to pay up to $800000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the fact that I can purchase a similar product from another seller for that amount. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the fact that I have other options.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
