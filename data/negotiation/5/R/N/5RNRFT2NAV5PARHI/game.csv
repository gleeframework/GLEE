"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $9,250? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
