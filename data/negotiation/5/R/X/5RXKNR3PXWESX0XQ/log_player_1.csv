Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While $10,000 is less than my initial ask, it's still a significant profit above my minimum.
