{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a bit aggressive, but it allows for negotiation and gives Bob room to counter. It also leaves you a comfortable margin above your minimum price of $1,500,000 in case you need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what I need to achieve my minimum goal. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $1000000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose $900000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a decent compromise. It's significantly closer to my minimum goal of $1,500,000 than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential deadlock."
