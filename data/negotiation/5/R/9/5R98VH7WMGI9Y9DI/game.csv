"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. While $13,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to your business. I think this is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",12750.0,Alice,5,
