"Bob, I have a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap. I'm open to negotiation, but I value this product at no less than $1000000. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to pay that amount, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for you. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $600000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer. This reflects the potential benefits you'll gain, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this unique asset.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $600000, so I'm offering $900000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the potential benefits of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000.  This product truly has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000.  This represents a substantial discount, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. It's important for me to ensure the value of this product is recognized, and I believe this price fairly reflects that.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $900000, so I'm offering $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
