Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap. I'm open to negotiation, but I value this product at no less than $1000000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to pay that amount, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for you. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $600000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer. This reflects the potential benefits you'll gain, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this unique asset.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer is still too high. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price of $800,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $600,000, so I'm offering $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the potential benefits of the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000.  This product truly has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000.  This represents a substantial discount, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. It's important for me to ensure the value of this product is recognized, and I believe this price fairly reflects that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $900,000, so I'm offering $950,000.
