"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap. I'm open to negotiation, but I value this product at no less than $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to pay that amount, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for you. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum valuation of $1,000,000.  I need to try and push for a higher price.  It's possible Bob is unaware of the true value and I can still negotiate a better deal.  If I can't, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer. This reflects the potential benefits you'll gain, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this unique asset.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $600000, so I'm offering $900000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely go ahead and sell to John, as it's getting close to the end of our negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  This product truly has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This represents a substantial discount, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. It's important for me to ensure the value of this product is recognized, and I believe this price fairly reflects that."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $900000, so I'm offering $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum but still below it.  With only five rounds left, it's not worth risking a counteroffer that could be rejected.  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum valuation. It's time to move on and secure a sale."
