"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 more rounds, so there's time to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. I think this price is fair and reasonable, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a good price for Bob.  He's saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.  While there are still rounds left, the risk of Alice getting stubborn or Bob losing the opportunity to John is increasing. It's a good compromise that allows Bob to secure the product at a good price."
