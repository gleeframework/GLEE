"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I respect that. Let's try this - $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential return on investment this product offers you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
