"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but this price would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and I'd like to see this transaction go through. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget is $12,000 and John is offering the product for that price.  There is a chance Bob could get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, but accepting this offer guarantees a good price and avoids the risk of Alice getting frustrated and ending the negotiations."
