# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000.
