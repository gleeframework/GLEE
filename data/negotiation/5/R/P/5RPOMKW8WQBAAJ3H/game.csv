"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product has great potential, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also taking into account your budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
