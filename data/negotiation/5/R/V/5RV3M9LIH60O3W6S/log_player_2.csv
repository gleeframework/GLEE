{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds to work with, so it's worthwhile to try and get a better price. 
* **Avoiding John is key:** Buying from John should be a last resort, as it costs you the most."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's still above Alice's value, so there's potential for a compromise. 
* **Avoids immediate John purchase:** This keeps you in the negotiation and potentially saves you a significant amount."

* **John is a last resort:**  It's still worthwhile to see if you can get closer to your ideal price before resorting to John."
