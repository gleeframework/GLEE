"Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  How about we split the difference?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
