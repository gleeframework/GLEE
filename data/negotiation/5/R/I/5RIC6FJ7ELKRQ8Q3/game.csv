"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $150 is a bit too low for me, as this product is worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $175?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close.  $155 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $160? It's a good price for both of us and ensures we both walk away satisfied.",160.0,Alice,7,
