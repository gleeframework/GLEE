# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This is a good starting point, but Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"",

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.

Alice is coming down, but we're still too far from a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."

""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",

```

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and ours.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the potential returns you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're already close to John's offer. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, potentially ending up with no deal at all.  Buying from John guarantees the product at our maximum price."
