"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable item that I know you'll find useful. This is a fair price, considering its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price? Perhaps something closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $500,000 is significantly below the product's worth. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This allows me some margin while still being within your budget range. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we perhaps aim for $600,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also showing appreciation for your product.",600000.0,Bob,4,
