Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"":**  Exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave some room for negotiation that might entice Bob while still staying above your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You confidently present the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" to add a sense of value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while keeping you well above your safety net of $1,500,000.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly shifts the focus from the raw number to the benefits Bob will receive.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate, but stand firm on not going below $1,500,000.
* **John is Your Leverage:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer gives you strength in the negotiation. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet a price that works for you."
