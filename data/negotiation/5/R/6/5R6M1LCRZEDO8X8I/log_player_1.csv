Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The price is above my minimum, giving me space to negotiate if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm countering with $900,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Mutual agreement:**  I frame my counteroffer as a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Commitment:**  By showing willingness to compromise, I'm demonstrating my commitment to closing the deal with Bob.

This approach allows me to explore further negotiation while keeping the door open to John's offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $850000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my minimum, but I still have time and rounds to try and get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can get closer to $900,000 before I consider settling for $850,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your persistence. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $875,000.  This offer is a fair compromise that reflects both the value of the product and your budget. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession by dropping the price to $875,000, showing flexibility.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I emphasize that this offer is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs.
* **Enthusiasm:**  I express enthusiasm to close the deal,  creating a sense of urgency.

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. We have four rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm still holding out hope that we can meet somewhere between $825,000 and my counteroffer of $875,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your commitment and understand your position. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with this deal.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle ground:** I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and meet halfway.
* **Mutual satisfaction:** I emphasize that this price is beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I mention finalizing the transaction quickly to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This approach aims to reach a compromise without going too low.  I'm still hoping to get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also aware that we are approaching the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'd like to propose a price of $800000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final offer, and it's at my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm aware that there are only two rounds left.  If I reject this offer, Bob might not counter again, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell at my minimum. 

Since John is offering the same price, it's wiser to secure the sale with John and avoid any further risk."
