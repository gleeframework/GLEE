Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's worth $150 to him. This makes the offer more attractive.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going all-in with the highest possible price. This allows for some give and take in the negotiation, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $120 seems a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is my minimum, I'm still willing to come down a bit.  Let's split the difference - how about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while showing I'm not completely inflexible.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, suggesting it benefits both parties.
* **Motivating factor:** By offering a price closer to my initial offer, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $90? That's a fair bit closer to your price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's only $10 less than my last counteroffer.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price, and I risk losing the sale to John. Accepting his offer ensures I secure a profit and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
