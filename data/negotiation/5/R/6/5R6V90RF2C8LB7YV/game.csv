"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate far more value for you in the long run. Let's meet halfway â€“  how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which reflects the value I see in this product and aligns with my budget. This is my final offer.  ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
