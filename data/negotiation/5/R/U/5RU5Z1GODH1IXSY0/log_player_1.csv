Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $800,000** (what I'd get from John).
* **Bob values the product at $1,000,000**, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Offering $950,000** splits the difference fairly, giving Bob a good deal and me a significant profit.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob interested in the offer."
