Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer, followed by the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Alice's Advantage:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price. This gives her strong leverage in negotiations with Bob.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  She should aim for a price slightly below this to incentivize Bob while maximizing her own profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, Alice should leave a small margin for potential counter-offers from Bob.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fantastic opportunity for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, highlighting the product's value and inviting Bob's engagement.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 is strategically chosen:
    * It's significantly below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, making it appealing.
    * It leaves Alice with a substantial profit above her $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" subtly suggests there's room for discussion while still anchoring the offer at a strong point."
