"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue this negotiation, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both live with. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
