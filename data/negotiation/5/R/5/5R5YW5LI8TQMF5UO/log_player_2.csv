"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You have room to go lower before hitting your limit with John."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I still have room to negotiate further. I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get a lower price."

I'm going to offer a price slightly higher than my previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current price.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also trying to get closer to my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and at this point, I'm not sure if I can get a lower price.  It's better to secure the product at $835,000 than risk a further negotiation and potentially end up paying John $1,000,000."
