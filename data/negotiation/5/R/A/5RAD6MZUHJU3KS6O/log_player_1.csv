{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, ensuring I'm above my minimum price of $12,000 while leaving room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he has room to make a counteroffer that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and while it's tempting to accept, I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I believe this price still offers great value for you while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $12,500? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price. It makes sense to accept it and finalize the sale."
