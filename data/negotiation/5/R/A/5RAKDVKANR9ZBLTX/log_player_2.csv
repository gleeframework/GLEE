"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $14,000.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000,  it's still above the product's value to Alice ($10,000). This means there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still higher than the product's value to Alice ($10,000) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($14,000). This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer and still below his maximum budget of $15,000.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and the opportunity cost of losing time makes accepting this offer the best strategy."
