(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're trying to get the best deal possible, so rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy.  You can likely get the price lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $92.50. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to get the best deal. While Alice's offer is closer to your target, you can likely get it down further.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps you in control."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $88 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're getting closer to your target price, but $90 is still too high. Keep trying to negotiate. If you reach the end of the rounds, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $89?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but $89 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me here, I'll have to sell the product to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on $90, and you're close to your target price, but with only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking it. You can always buy from John for $80, securing the product within your budget."
