"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair offer:**  It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have room to lower the price if needed, without going below your minimum.
* **It's positive and engaging:**  The message encourages Bob to think about the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120. I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to that price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $92.50. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $88 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $89?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $89 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer one last time. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $89 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me here, I'll have to sell the product to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 90}
