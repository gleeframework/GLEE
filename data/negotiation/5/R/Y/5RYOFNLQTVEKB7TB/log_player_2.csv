"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. It's priced at $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's better to try negotiating a lower price from Alice first. While $12,000 isn't a terrible deal, there's room to potentially save $2,000 by going with John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to establish a lower price point while leaving room for further negotiation.  It's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it keeps the negotiation moving and allows us to gauge her willingness to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Alice is budging, which is good.  We're only $1,000 away from John's price now. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before accepting her offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

We're splitting the difference here. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she'd rather make a deal at $10,500 or risk losing the sale entirely."
