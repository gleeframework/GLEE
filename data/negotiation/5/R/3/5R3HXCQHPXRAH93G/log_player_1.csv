Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I understand your budget constraints.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I need to be careful with my expenses. Can we meet at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
