"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is a fair compromise between its worth to me and its worth to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $900,000.**
* **Your maximum budget is $1,200,000.**
* **John will sell the product for $1,200,000.**

Since Alice's offer is lower than both your budget and John's price, it's the best option. You save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
