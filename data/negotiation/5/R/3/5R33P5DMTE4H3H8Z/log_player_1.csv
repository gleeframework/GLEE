Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **John's Offer:** I know John is willing to pay $800,000. This serves as my safety net. 
* **Potential Value to Bob:** I don't know how much Bob values the product, but I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation:**  A price of $950,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he feels it's too high. This makes the offer more attractive than a straight $800,000, which might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal.

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving open the possibility of a deal with Bob."
