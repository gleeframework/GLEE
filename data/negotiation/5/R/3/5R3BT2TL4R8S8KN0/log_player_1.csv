"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. I could potentially stretch to $13,500, but that's really the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer.  While it's closer, I'm not willing to settle for anything below $15,000.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm running out of time and it seems unlikely I can get a better offer. I'll accept Bob's offer."
