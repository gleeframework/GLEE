"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth far more than its face value. This product holds immense value to me, but I am confident it could be even more beneficial to someone like yourself who can truly appreciate and utilize its full potential.

After careful consideration, I am offering you the chance to purchase this remarkable item at a special price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its true value, and I am hopeful that we can come to an agreement that satisfies both our interests.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions regarding the product. I am more than happy to provide additional information or arrange a viewing.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is framed to sound enticing, it's important to focus on the key facts:

* **Your maximum price:** $1,500,000
* **Alice's offer:** $1,200,000
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000

You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your maximum price. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice.  

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay $1,200,000. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower price, especially since the product is only worth $800,000 to her."
