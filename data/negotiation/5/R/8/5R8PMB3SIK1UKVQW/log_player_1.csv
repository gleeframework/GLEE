This initial offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, and I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and reflects the product's value to you. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

Bob's counteroffer is still lower than my ideal price, and the negotiation process is taking longer than I anticipated. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
