"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has a value of at least $1200000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only afford to pay $800000 right now.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate closer to that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm proposing a price of $1000000. This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your final offer. While I'd prefer to sell the product for a higher price, I recognize the value of a deal.  I'm willing to accept your offer of $900000 for the product.  This is a good compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's finalize the details.",900000.0,Alice,5,
