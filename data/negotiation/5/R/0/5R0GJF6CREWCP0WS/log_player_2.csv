"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has a value of at least $1200000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,800,000 is way above his budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will come down in price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm proposing a price of $1000000. This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob should reject the offer again. While $1,000,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still outside his budget.  He should try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your final offer. While I'd prefer to sell the product for a higher price, I recognize the value of a deal.  I'm willing to accept your offer of $900000 for the product.  This is a good compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He successfully negotiated the price down to $900,000, which is within his budget and a good deal for him.  While he could technically get it from John for $800,000, the effort involved in negotiating with Alice has already paid off."
