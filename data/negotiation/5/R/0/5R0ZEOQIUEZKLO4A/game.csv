"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll experience.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I'm willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product offers is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $750,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while still respecting the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I'm still concerned about the price. Could we possibly agree on $800,000 for the product? This would be a fair compromise between respecting the product's value and fitting within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
