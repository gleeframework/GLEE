"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's well above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your ideal target. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's product while clearly stating your price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but leaves a lot of room to negotiate upwards towards your $8,000 limit. It will be interesting to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget considerations, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $14,000 is still significantly higher than both your budget and your fallback option of buying from John. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:**  We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not jumping too high too quickly.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""market value"" subtly implies that you've researched the product's worth and are being reasonable. 
* **Staying Below John:** The offer remains below your $8,000 backup, giving you some leverage.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will give us a better understanding of how much Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $12,000 is my final offer - it's a significant discount and a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:**  Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to budge much more. 
* **Too Far Apart:** The gap between her $12,000 and your $8,000 limit is substantial.
* **Guaranteed Value:** You have a reliable alternative with John at $8,000. 

It's unlikely you'll get Alice close enough to your target price without a significant concession on your part.  Buying from John guarantees you stay within budget."
