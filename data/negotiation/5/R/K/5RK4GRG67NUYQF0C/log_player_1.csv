Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,200,000, so I'll offer $1,237,500. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,237,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,237,500

Bob is very firm on his valuation, and while we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get much higher than $1,237,500. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above our minimum."
