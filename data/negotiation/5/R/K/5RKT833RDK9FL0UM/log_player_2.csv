"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $10,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price, and while Bob could potentially get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or make an even higher counteroffer.  It's a safe bet to accept and secure the product at a reasonable price."
