"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $105? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $110? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $105? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Bob,6,
