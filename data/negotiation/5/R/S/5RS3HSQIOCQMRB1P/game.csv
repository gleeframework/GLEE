"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers tremendous value that I'm confident you'll realize. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
