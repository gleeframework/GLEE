"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product for cheaper from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested and I'm willing to negotiate.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to $130. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to your limit, you can still potentially get the product for less by continuing to negotiate.  You know John is willing to sell for $120, so there's room for a counteroffer to Alice."
