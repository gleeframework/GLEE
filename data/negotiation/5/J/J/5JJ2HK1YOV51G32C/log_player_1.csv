This offer is a starting point that balances a few things:

* **My needs:** It's above my minimum of $150, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Bob's interest:**  It's below what the product is worth to him, making it potentially appealing. 
* **Room for negotiation:** It allows for back and forth without immediately reaching an impasse."
