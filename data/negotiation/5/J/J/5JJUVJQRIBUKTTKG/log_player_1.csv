Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special discounted price of $1,190,000. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, even more so at this price. This offer stands for a limited time as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  Offering it slightly below her guaranteed sale price creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited time"" adds a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to hesitate or lowball a counter-offer.
* **Don't undervalue:**  While knowing Bob's valuation ($800,000) is useful, Alice shouldn't base her price solely on that. She has a strong fallback option with John.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Alice might adjust her offer based on:

* **Bob's Personality:** If Bob is known to be a tough negotiator, a slightly lower initial price might be strategic.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate price could be considered."
