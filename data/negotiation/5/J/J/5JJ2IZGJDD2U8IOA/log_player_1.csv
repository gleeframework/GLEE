Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
