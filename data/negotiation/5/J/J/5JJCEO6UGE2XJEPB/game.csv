"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm!  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm ready to offer you $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $105. How about we settle on $108? That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
