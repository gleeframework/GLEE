Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still potentially making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $128.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $128 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  Bob's persistence suggests he might be willing to go higher, but I'm not confident enough to continue negotiating. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is a better deal for me.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
