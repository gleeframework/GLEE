"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $90 is still above your target of $100, so a counteroffer is a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $87? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $87 is within my budget of $100, and it's a good compromise. It's better than going to John and paying $100."
