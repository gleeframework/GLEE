"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $2000000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always wise to start negotiating from a lower price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it,  which reflects the value I see and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. Considering the value of the product and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1800000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to go up to $1400000. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1550000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting the offer gives you an opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to your target price. It's important to remember you can always buy from John at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  I believe this is a great opportunity to finalize the deal and avoid any further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make another move. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1575000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you only have three rounds left. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price is increasing. It's more prudent to secure the product from John at your maximum budget and avoid further potential losses."
