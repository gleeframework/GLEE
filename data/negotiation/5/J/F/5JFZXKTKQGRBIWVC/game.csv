"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $800000 for it. This aligns better with my budget constraints. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply not enough for me to let go of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1400000 for it to make sense for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm going to be upfront.  $1300000 is my final offer.  It's lower than what I'd prefer, but it's a significant discount from my original price, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your budget.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other options.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I am unable to exceed $800000 for your product. I hope this meets your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,6,
