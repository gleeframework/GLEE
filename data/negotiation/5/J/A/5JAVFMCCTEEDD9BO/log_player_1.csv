Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting, Alice. Given the potential value of the product, I'm willing to consider a price closer to its perceived value to you. My counteroffer for the product is $1200000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired value. I have 8 rounds remaining, and there's potential for a better outcome."

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my desired value and within my acceptable range.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of reaching an impasse or running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and allows me to move on."
