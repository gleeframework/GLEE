"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to try negotiating a lower price with Alice first. While $9,000 isn't terrible, there's room to save money.  We can start by offering a lower amount and see how Alice responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000) while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her minimum, but there's still room to negotiate. Let's try a counteroffer a bit below her current offer to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

We're proposing a price that matches Alice's value for the product. This might be agreeable to her, and it represents a significant saving for us."
