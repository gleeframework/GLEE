"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a low counteroffer (but not ridiculously low) gives room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Alice to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice came down in price, but it's still above our budget. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer, but staying well below Alice's last price. 
* **Justification:**  Offering a specific reason (""fair price"") might make the offer more appealing.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** We're getting closer to our $80 limit with John. Alice needs to come down further in the next round or two to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating with her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice went up in price instead of down, indicating she may be unlikely to come close to our desired price range.
* **Time Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks wasting time and potentially missing out on John's offer. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer of $80 is the best we can hope for and avoids further uncertainty."
