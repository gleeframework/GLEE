"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in this product but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value for the product and well within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm happy to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to compromise at $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a decent return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's value to you. I'm genuinely interested in buying this product from you.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a decent return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
