"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I recognize its value, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair market value considering my budget and the potential benefits. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own goals. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
