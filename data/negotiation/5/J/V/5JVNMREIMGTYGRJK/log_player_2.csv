I'm starting with my maximum price, $100. This is a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about a deal and gives Alice room to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice's offer is closer to my limit, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price slightly above my initial proposal but still below Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm willing to meet halfway but am still firm on my budget."
