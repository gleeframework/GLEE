"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept anything higher.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still too high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1,025,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay and what he can get from John. Bob will try to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice is still too high on her price, and he's likely to continue bouncing back and forth without a deal. It's better to get the product at his desired price from John."
