"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant move from my initial offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll do one better and offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
