{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to get closer to my budget, and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant move from my initial offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll do one better and offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget. While we're getting closer, it's risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance Alice will keep lowering her price, but there's also a chance she'll get stubborn and we won't reach a deal. It's safer and more efficient to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget and guarantees the purchase."
