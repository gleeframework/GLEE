Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice has come down in price, but it's still more expensive than buying from John. You've made progress in the negotiation, but it's unlikely Alice will go below $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
