I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good price for both of us:

* It's significantly higher than what I would get from John ($1,000,000), giving me a much better profit.
* It's still lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), meaning he still gets a good deal.

This strategy is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
