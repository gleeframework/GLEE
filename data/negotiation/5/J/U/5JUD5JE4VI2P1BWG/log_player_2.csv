{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is too high. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  It's close to your limit, but you have 5 rounds left.  You might be able to negotiate down further or, if it's too risky, accept the $120 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 
You should offer $115. It's a slight increase from your previous offer but is still below Alice's last offer, indicating your willingness to negotiate. With only 4 rounds left, you need to be more aggressive to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is just a dollar less than what you would pay John, but you have only three rounds left. It's unlikely that you will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the remaining rounds.  It's safer to buy from John at this point."
