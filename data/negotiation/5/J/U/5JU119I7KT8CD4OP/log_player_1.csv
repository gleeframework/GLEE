"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room for me to lower the price if needed. It's important to remember that I have a minimum value of $800,000, and I can always fall back on selling to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'd like to see if we can reach a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer and closer to my desired value. I believe this price is reasonable and gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I get a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired value.  While I'd like to get even closer to $1,000,000, I'm concerned about running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
