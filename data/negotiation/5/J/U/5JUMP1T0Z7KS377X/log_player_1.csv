Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives Bob a potential $25 discount while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle for less than $150. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is fair to both of us, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept and the maximum he's willing to pay."
