# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $10200 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I'm close to agreeing with her, I'm unwilling to spend any more than $10,000. Therefore, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
