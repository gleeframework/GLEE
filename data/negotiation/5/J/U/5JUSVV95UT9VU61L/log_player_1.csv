"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. My starting price is $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to start with a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open communication:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm engaging Bob by asking for his thoughts, which shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially find common ground. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option to sell to John for $120, but I'm giving Bob a chance to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I want to close a deal, accepting $80 is far below my minimum of $120. 
* **Counter-offer potential:** I can still make a counter-offer and try to bridge the gap. It's possible Bob is willing to pay a bit more than $80.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I still have the option to sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle ground:** $95 is closer to Bob's offer but still comfortably above my minimum.  
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging, aiming for a positive and mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still a gap, and I'm hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.
* **John remains an option:**  If this deal falls through, I can still sell to John for a significantly higher price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's try $92.50.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Midpoint compromise:** $92.50 is very close to the middle ground between our last offers, signaling a desire to close the deal. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" and the ""good deal"" aspects to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced it's worth $92.50. I can go up to $90, but I'm not willing to pay more than that. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge further, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum. 
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly higher than the best offer from Bob. 
* **Time is limited:** We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better offer by continuing with Bob. 

By selling to John, I'm maximizing my profit and closing the deal within the allotted rounds."
