# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12000 by you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is higher than what I would charge another potential buyer, ensuring you get the best deal possible. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
