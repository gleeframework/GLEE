"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to something in that range?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can sell the product to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. How about we meet at $12,500? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Alice,5,
