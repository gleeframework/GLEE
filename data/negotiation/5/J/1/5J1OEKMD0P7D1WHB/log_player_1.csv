"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that the product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm keeping the message friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation. This keeps the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** Even though $80 is my minimum, I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  I want to see if I can get a higher price.  
* **Exploring Negotiation:**  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can encourage Bob to come up a bit in his price. 
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiating, $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a counter-price of $90, which is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $80 to me.
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer represents a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  Bob has come up to $85, which is only $5 less than my initial offer and is within my acceptable range. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids further negotiation.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject his offer, there's no guarantee he'll come up higher.  I might end up stuck with John's offer of $80 or even a lower price if I continue to negotiate.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting the offer now saves time and effort, and I can move on to other opportunities."
