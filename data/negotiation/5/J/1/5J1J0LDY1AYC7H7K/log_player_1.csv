{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for potential profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Easy for Bob to understand.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your desire to maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $105. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
