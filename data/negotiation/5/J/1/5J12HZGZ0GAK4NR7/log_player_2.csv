"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still save money by either negotiating further with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's target price of $12,000.  John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, making it the most financially advantageous option."
