"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, as it's worth that much to me. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a really great product, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer willing to pay that.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we're not going to agree at this rate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but this is my final offer. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $115 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $107.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",107.5,Bob,6,
