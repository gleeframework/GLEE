"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intention to negotiate and hopefully sparks a discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not within my desired price range. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  However, it's still lower than her last offer, and I'm keeping the pressure on to get closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $850,000 which is a good deal for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal or ending up paying more if I go to John. It's better to accept this offer and save $650,000 compared to buying from John."
