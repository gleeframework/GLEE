You have three options:

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a backup option with John for $800,000, rejecting Alice's offer of $850,000 is the best initial move.  You can then counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your target of $800,000.  You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a good backup option with John, so you can afford to be a bit more aggressive with your counteroffers."
