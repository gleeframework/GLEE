Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However,  $1,350,000 doesn't adequately reflect the value of this product and the potential it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.

I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,375,000. This is my best offer, and it's a significant reduction from my initial price.
