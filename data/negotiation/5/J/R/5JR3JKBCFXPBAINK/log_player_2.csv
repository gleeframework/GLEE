"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's still a substantial amount of money that might be tempting.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** By starting lower, we create space to negotiate upwards towards a price that's acceptable to both parties. 
* **Time pressure:** We haven't forgotten about John's offer. By starting with a lower offer, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Alice to engage in meaningful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. We need to push a little further and see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $675,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 675000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($750,000) and our previous offer ($600,000). 
* **Moving closer to John:** While still aiming for a good deal, we're getting closer to John's price. This keeps the pressure on Alice to negotiate seriously. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes fairness, hoping to encourage a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and settle on $712,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $712,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $712,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. At this point, her offer of $712,500 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of her digging in and not going any lower, leaving us to accept a higher price than John's or walk away empty-handed.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
