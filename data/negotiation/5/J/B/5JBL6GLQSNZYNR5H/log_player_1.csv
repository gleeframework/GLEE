"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $650,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
 While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to push a little further since we still have rounds to go before I need to consider John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're definitely close.  I appreciate you working with me on this. To show you I'm serious about closing the deal, how about $850,000? That's a significant price drop and demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the movement you've made so far.  To be honest, I have another offer for $800,000. To make this work with you, I can't go any higher than that. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's unlikely he'll go any higher.  Accepting his offer ensures I get the best possible price without risking the deal by going another round."
