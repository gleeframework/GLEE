"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value I place on it, I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000. This is my maximum budget, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've invested significant time and resources into this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. Considering the value you place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's discuss a price of $1,650,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and your budget. What are your thoughts?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000, which is a significant step towards meeting your needs. This reflects the value I place on the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.
