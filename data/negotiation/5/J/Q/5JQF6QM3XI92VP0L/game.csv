"Bob, I have a product that I believe is worth a great deal to you. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial price is $25000, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be significant to you, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $8000? I'm hoping for a more reasonable offer that would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $18000. This price still reflects the value I see in this product. It's a significant investment, but I believe you'll reap the benefits for years to come.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, could we possibly meet somewhere around $14000? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",14000.0,Bob,4,
