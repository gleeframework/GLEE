"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to immediately be rejected.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer while still leaving me with a profit higher than my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value, suggesting it's worth the price. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm keeping the option to sell to John open as a backup, which provides leverage.
* I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed alternative with John that offers a much better return.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price in the next round, potentially bringing him closer to my desired price point.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob in round 3, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.
* I will continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail to yield a satisfactory outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good price while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation and is above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and open to further discussion.
* **Focusing on Benefits:** I emphasize the benefit Bob will get from the deal at this price point.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I am keeping my options open: I can still sell to John if this negotiation fails.
* I am closely monitoring Bob's responses and will adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds based on his behavior. 
* My goal is to reach a deal that is profitable for me while also being acceptable to Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer remains a better alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me a significantly higher profit, making his offer the more appealing option.
* **Opportunity for a final counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make one last counteroffer in the next round, potentially bringing him closer to my desired price point. However, I'm aware that time is running out.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a final counteroffer to Bob in round 5, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.
* I will carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to sell to John if his counteroffer is not satisfactory.
* I will need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,020,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to pursue other options.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm lowering my price again, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate that the offer is a good deal for both of us.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the time constraint and the possibility of pursuing other options. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This is a high-risk move. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely have to sell to John. 
* I'm hoping that the urgency and the close proximity to my minimum acceptable price will push Bob to accept.
* I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this final offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're on round 6, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John will secure a significantly higher profit for me, even if I've lost some negotiating leverage. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further price concessions and potentially losing the deal entirely.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000. While I would have preferred to negotiate a higher price with Bob, the time constraint and the guaranteed profit with John make it the best decision at this point."
