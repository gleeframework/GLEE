"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $25000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $4000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to what I'm looking to spend?",6000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I've made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $12000 and $8000, which is $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
