"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential for future collaboration.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $860,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",860000.0,Bob,4,
