The offer is above your budget, so it's best to try to negotiate a lower price.  There's potential to get a better deal with Alice or you can always go to John as a backup."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still a fair price for her, as it's close to her valuation, and it gives me some room to potentially reach a compromise."

Alice is getting closer to my price, but $1,550,000 is still above my limit. I'll reject and try to get a better deal through another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,450,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still keeping it below my budget. Hopefully, this will be enough to get Alice to accept."

Alice is still above my budget, even though she's lowered her price. At this point, John offers a better deal that's within my budget, so I'll go with that option to avoid further negotiation."
