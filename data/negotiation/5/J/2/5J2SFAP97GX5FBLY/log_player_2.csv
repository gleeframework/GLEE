"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a better deal than buying from John:**  $900,000 is cheaper than $1,000,000.
* **There's limited room for further negotiation:**  Bob already made a counteroffer and Alice rejected it.  Further negotiation might risk losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
