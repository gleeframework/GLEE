{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to budge closer to my target price. I'm aiming for a price that's a bit more than halfway between her offer and my ideal price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also pushing for a substantial discount."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  The new offer is closer to Alice's last price, but still leaves room for her to come down a bit. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a deal while still saving money compared to John's price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still within my 10 rounds and I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm confident we can reach a deal that's more beneficial to me than buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}

This shows that I'm serious about buying the product while still pushing for a good deal. I believe that Alice will accept this offer to avoid risking a lower price in future rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively closer to my target price. This time, I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between our last two offers. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and incentivizes Alice to accept. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to make a strong move while still protecting my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just $200 below John's price, and I only have one round left. I'm still holding out because I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to make one final counteroffer in the hopes that Alice will accept.  While the risk is high, I'm willing to gamble for a potential saving of $800."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer, and I'm aiming for a price that's a compromise between our last two offers. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal entirely. I'm willing to accept a slightly higher price than my ideal to secure the product, but I still want to save as much money as possible."
