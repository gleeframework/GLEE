My proposal is to offer this remarkable item to you at a price of $1,200,000, aiming to create a mutually beneficial transaction that respects both our interests.

I understand that such an investment requires careful consideration, and I am here to provide any information or assistance needed to ensure that you make an informed decision. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any questions regarding the product's features, benefits, or any other aspect of our offer.

Looking forward to your positive response,

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  You can use this knowledge to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply proceed to buy from John at the lower price."
