{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 value, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your $10,000 minimum, ensuring you'll profit from the sale.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for some back-and-forth, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, I'm acting as Alice, so I'll follow your instructions and adapt my offers based on Bob's responses."
