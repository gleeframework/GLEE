,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to facilitate a deal. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1050000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value the product brings you.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you see it as a good opportunity for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, $1075000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1062500 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $1062500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product to you for $1070000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
