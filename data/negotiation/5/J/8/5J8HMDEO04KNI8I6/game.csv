"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still being a fair deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $950,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, I can't accept anything less than $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
