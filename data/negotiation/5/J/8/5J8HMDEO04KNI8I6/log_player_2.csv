"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still being a fair deal for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, I can't accept anything less than $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is firm on her price and unlikely to go below $1,050,000. It's time to cut our losses and go with John, who's offering the product at our target price."
