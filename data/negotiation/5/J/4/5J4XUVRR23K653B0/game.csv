"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects the product's worth while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,325,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's try this - $1,137,500. This is a significant reduction on my part and shows my willingness to make a deal.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,137,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This shows my commitment to reaching a deal while staying within my budget.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
