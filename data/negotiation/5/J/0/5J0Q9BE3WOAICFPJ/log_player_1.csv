Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product you're selling. I'd like to counter with an offer of $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit more. Bob's counteroffer is  low, and I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $150 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $175? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $160. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved a bit closer to my desired price.  $160 is still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing him completely by continuing to push for more.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
