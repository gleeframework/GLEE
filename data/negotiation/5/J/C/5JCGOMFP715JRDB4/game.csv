"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I can do $775,000.  That's a very competitive offer and I think it makes sense for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $790,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can see the value in this compromise.",790000.0,Alice,7,
