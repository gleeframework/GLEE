"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1,100,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
