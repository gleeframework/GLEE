{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find common ground and make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm not willing to go above $1,500,000, which is what I can get from John.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to my limit."

Round 4
