"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my ideal.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the opportunity for Bob. This helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message invites Bob to respond, indicating that I'm open to dialogue and potentially finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2000000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.**  While I'm open to negotiation,  $1,200,000 is too far below my desired price point.
* **I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob.**  There's still room to explore options and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is a viable option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob.**  I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find common ground and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  
* **Fairness:**  I'm positioning the counteroffer as a fair price for both parties, emphasizing that it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Urgency:** The message hints at a sense of urgency by suggesting that we find common ground and make the deal work. This subtly pressures Bob to consider my offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message remains positive and focused on finding a solution.  This helps maintain a constructive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $1500000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable value. 
* **No Further Upside:**  While I'd prefer to get more, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price. Bob has indicated this is his final offer.
* **Time is a Factor:**  I've already had 3 rounds of negotiation, and continuing could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John would give me the same amount, but I prefer to close with Bob if possible. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice, as it secures my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
