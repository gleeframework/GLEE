"Alice,  $2000000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find common ground and make this deal work.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $1500000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
