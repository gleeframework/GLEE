"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to $16,000?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $17,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $16,500.  This is the absolute highest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $16,500. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16750.0,Alice,5,
