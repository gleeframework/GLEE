Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob to entice him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before potentially needing to move to Plan B (selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm rejecting the offer to keep the negotiation going and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by counter-offering with a lower price.
* **Maintaining value:** I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my starting point.
* **Finding common ground:** My message aims to emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $950,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm still optimistic that we can find a middle ground, so I'm rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $975,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to reiterate why this price is fair.
* **Closing the deal:**  This offer puts us in a position where Bob might be inclined to accept, but it also leaves room for a few more rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $925,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. However, I'm running out of time.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to close the deal in the next few rounds, but I'm also getting ready to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $925,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant value for you.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I encourage you to accept."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, so I'm putting the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's latest offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and that if Bob doesn't accept, I might have to sell to John. 

This approach aims to close the deal quickly while still maximizing my profits."
