"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $130. This is a fantastic deal, as it's worth significantly more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

We can try to get a better price from Alice.  While $130 is within budget, there's room to negotiate before hitting the $150 maximum."
