"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is only slightly below my maximum price. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the starting point, that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to her new price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the updated offer! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,250, which is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to hold onto a higher profit margin. While $7,250 is tempting, I think I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two. I'm willing to risk it to save a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly. How about $7,100? That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 7100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, which is a bit higher than your offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  $7,200 is a good price, and it's not worth the risk of her raising the price again or the deal falling through."
