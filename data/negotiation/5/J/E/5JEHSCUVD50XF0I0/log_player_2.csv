"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of starting at $1,200,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm ready to buy but would need the price to be closer to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession. How about $1,075,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Current Situation:** Alice is offering $1,075,000. John is offering $1,000,000. 
* **Bob's Goal:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Analysis:**  While $1,075,000 is not the absolute lowest price, it's only $75,000 more than John's offer.  This is a small price difference to pay for the potential of negotiating an even lower price with Alice.
* **Decision:** Accepting Alice's offer at this point is a strategic move. It allows Bob to secure the product while staying within his budget. He can still potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price in future rounds if the opportunity arises."
