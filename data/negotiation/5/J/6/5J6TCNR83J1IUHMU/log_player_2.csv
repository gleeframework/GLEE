# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than his maximum budget of $15,000, it's still a significant amount. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would give you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
