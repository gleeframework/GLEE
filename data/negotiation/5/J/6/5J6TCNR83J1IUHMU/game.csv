"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let me know if you're open to that.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would give you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
