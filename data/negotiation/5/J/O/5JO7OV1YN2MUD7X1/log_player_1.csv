Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality.  However, $150 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
