# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Considering its unique features and benefits, I believe it would be an excellent addition to your business. For this exceptional opportunity, I am offering the product at a special introductory price of $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it, given my target price range. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider a compromise. For your convenience and within the scope of our business strategy, I propose to sell the product to you for $825000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his target price. There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. Given my budget and the fact that I'm ready to make a decision soon, I'm willing to offer $780,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise at this level."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad to see we're making progress. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose to sell the product to you for $800000. This price is a fair compromise considering both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $800,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. While he could try to negotiate lower, it's risky. If Alice rejects his counteroffer, he'll have to buy from John at the same price.  It's safer to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
