"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a better counter-offer or allows you to purchase from John at your desired price point."
