"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counter. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $7,750? That's a significant discount from my original asking price.",7750.0,Alice,5,
