Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $14,500 is more favorable than risking a lower offer or taking John's standing offer of $15,000.
