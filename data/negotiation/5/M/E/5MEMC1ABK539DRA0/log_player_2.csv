"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  It's worth exploring the possibility of a lower price before buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget of $800,000. While it's still higher than Bob's ideal price, there's a chance Alice won't budge further. Accepting the offer secures the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially breaking down."
