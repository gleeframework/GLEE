{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage in a negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can get at least $150 for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John as a backup:**  Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $130 to $110. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Maintain Margin:**  $110 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me a better chance of securing a deal while still getting a good return.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing that $110 is a ""fair price"" and a ""good deal"" for both of us, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $100 is only slightly higher than Bob's initial offer and significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further concessions and potentially ending up with a price below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is offering me a guaranteed price of $150, which is more than I can get from Bob at this point.

By selling to John, I secure the best possible outcome, guaranteeing a profit that meets my minimum requirement."
