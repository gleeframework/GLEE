"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept your offer of $850,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway, at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $950,000 for the product? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but still below my initial proposal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
