Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** While you could aim higher (e.g., $14,500), there's a greater chance Bob will reject the offer outright. $14,000 is a strong offer that still nets you a significant profit over your minimum."
