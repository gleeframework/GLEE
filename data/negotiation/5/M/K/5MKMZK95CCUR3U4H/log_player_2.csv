Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Start with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a good starting point, but adjust the offer based on how much you think the product is worth to Alice."

``` 

You're still aiming to get the product for under $120. Even though Alice is getting closer to your target, rejecting the offer gives you one more round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 118}

You're almost at your limit, so you're making a final counteroffer.  This is a significant compromise, but it's the last chance to get a price that's slightly lower than John's offer."

```

You've reached a point where Alice's offer is only slightly better than John's. At this point, it's more beneficial to go with John and secure the product at your limit of $120.  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further in the remaining rounds."
