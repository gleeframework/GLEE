Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
