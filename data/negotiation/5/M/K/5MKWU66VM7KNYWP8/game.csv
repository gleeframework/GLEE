"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't part with it for less than $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
