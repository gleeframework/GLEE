"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering your enthusiasm, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9,750. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,200.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation.  $10,200 is getting closer, but to make this work for me, I can't go any higher than $9,900.  What do you think?",9900.0,Bob,6,
