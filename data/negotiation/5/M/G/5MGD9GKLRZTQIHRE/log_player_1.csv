Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to incentivize him to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room to bargain and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm trying to maintain a positive relationship with Bob, as he might be a future customer. 
* **Prepared to walk away:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value strengthens my negotiating position.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and professional tone keeps the door open for a successful negotiation."
