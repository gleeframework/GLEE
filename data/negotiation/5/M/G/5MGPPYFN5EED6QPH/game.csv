"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is my maximum price point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counter with a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to split the difference on our last offers and offer $1000000. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer, so I'd like to counter with a price of $1100000. This is a fair price for the product, and I believe it's worth considering. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1000000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service package worth $100000. This way, you'll get an even better value for your money. I'm sticking with my price of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
