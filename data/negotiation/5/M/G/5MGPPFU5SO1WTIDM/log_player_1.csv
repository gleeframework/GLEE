"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $15,000 is a good starting point because it allows for a few rounds of negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Showing interest:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a lower price. I will also consider if John's offer of $10,000 is becoming more attractive as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price.** While $12,000 is not bad, I am still aiming for a higher price.  
* **There are still rounds left.** Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a better outcome.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.** I am not yet desperate enough to accept John's offer, which is my absolute minimum.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob. My counteroffer will likely be somewhere between $12,000 and my initial $15,000, depending on how I feel about the negotiation and how confident I am that Bob will accept. I will also consider how many rounds are left and how willing I am to risk further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a good starting point,  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but not drastically. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Framing the offer:**  I highlight the reduction from the initial offer, making the current price appear more attractive.
* **Staying above John's offer:**  $13,500 is still above John's offer, ensuring that I'm not losing out by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I may consider a further reduction, but I'll also keep in mind how many rounds are left. The closer we get to the final round, the more I might consider John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12750?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer is very close to my last counteroffer. It's a good compromise that allows me to make a decent profit while also securing a sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a better price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. With only six rounds left, the potential for a better offer is decreasing. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer of $10,000 is still available, accepting Bob's offer provides a $2,750 profit, which is significantly better.

**Next Steps:**

Since I have accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete. I will move forward with the transaction and finalize the sale."
