"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to lower the price by 20%. This shows Alice he is serious about buying the product, but also sets a clear expectation of needing a substantial price reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is a good starting point,  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob is determined to save as much as possible and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to negotiate by offering a price in the middle of Alice's previous offer and his own.  This shows he's willing to compromise while still seeking a good price."
