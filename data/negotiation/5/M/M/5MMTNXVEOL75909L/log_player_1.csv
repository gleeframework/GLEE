"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price, especially since John is willing to pay $1,000,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price or sell to John for $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise and gets us both closer to our goals. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is as close as I can get to your target without breaking my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm hesitant to accept, as John is a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000. I'll counter with one last attempt to reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $980,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000 as a final compromise.  This price is just a small step away from your offer, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $990,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $985,000, which is as close as I can get to your target without breaking my budget. I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  While $985,000 is close, it's still below my minimum.  Since John is a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
