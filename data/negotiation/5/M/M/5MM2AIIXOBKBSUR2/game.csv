"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe the product is worth significantly more in the current market.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's the highest I can go. I'm really interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
