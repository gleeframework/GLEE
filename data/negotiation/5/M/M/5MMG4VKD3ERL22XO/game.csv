"Alice,  $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I'm confident this product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure the price is right.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This still reflects a great deal for you considering the value it will bring.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
