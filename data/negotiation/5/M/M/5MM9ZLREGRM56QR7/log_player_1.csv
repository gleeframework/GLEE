Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,312,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,312,500 is a strong win. It significantly exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing Bob entirely."
