,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming a bit higher. How about $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,312,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",1312500.0,Bob,4,
