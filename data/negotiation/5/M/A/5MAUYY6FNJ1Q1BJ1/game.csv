"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While we appreciate your offer, we're unable to match it due to the high demand and limited supply of our premium items. However, we're willing to negotiate further. Considering the value and benefits of the product, we propose a revised price of $850,000. We believe this still offers a substantial saving compared to the market value while providing a fair deal for both parties.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your budget constraints. After careful consideration, we're willing to further accommodate your request. We propose a revised price of $825,000 for our premium product. This still offers a significant discount compared to the market value while ensuring a reasonable profit margin for us. We hope this proposal will be more in line with your expectations.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $825,000 is still a bit steep for me.  My final offer is $800,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
