"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not sure if it's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,050,000, as I offered earlier, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
