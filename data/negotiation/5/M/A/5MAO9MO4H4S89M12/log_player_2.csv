"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's way above his budget, and he knows he can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating to see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900,000? "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a better price from John. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not sure if it's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,050,000, as I offered earlier, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice is being stubborn, and while she's offering extras, it seems like she's just trying to get a better price. Bob has been consistent with his offer of $1,000,000, and Alice is showing no signs of backing down.  It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John."
