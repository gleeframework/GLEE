"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures a potentially profitable deal with Bob.  I also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to pay less than $120. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than $80, I can likely still get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. I'm confident I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
