"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down a bit. Unfortunately, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and call it $115? That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair too.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a good compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,6,
