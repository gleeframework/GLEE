"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is only $1,000 less than her perceived value. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price, especially since we have the backup option of buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  We start with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This is a common negotiation tactic to establish a lower starting point. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Offering $9,000 leaves us space to negotiate upwards while still potentially staying below our $10,000 limit.
* **Polite and professional:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price range, but we're still paying a premium compared to John's offer. Since we have several rounds left and know Alice is willing to negotiate, it's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we settle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:** We're increasing our offer, but by a smaller increment ($750) than Alice's previous decrease ($500). This signals our interest while maintaining pressure to lower the price.
* **Staying below John's offer:** Our offer remains below John's $10,000 price, giving us some leverage.
* **Open for negotiation:** The language still suggests a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While $10,250 is close to John's price, we're unlikely to get a better deal from Alice. At this point, it's more strategic to take John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
