"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a living, and I need to get at least a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
