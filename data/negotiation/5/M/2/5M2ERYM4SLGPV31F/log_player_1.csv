"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point that balances maximizing profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more. By starting at $100, I'm leaving space for some back-and-forth.  I also want to be mindful of my minimum value of $120 and the possibility of selling to John at that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to sell just yet.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer. This will give me more room to negotiate in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great price for this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still looking to pay $85. If you can meet me there, we can make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept $85. I'm going to make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a bit more on this product. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm flexible and willing to work with you, but I can't go any lower than that. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. Let's try $87.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although I am getting closer to my minimum value, I am still not willing to sell the product for less than $90.  I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming to meet in the middle and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise!  Let's meet in the middle and agree on $88.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. How about $87? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm getting close to my minimum value. However, I'm not willing to take the risk of not being able to sell the product at all. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, which is more important than potentially losing out on a few extra dollars."
