"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's something you've expressed great interest in, and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for you.  I'm asking for $850,000 for it. This price reflects its high quality and the potential it holds. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and discussing it further.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750,000 is a tempting offer, it's a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise, however, and I'm prepared to come down to $825,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $780,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $780,000 just doesn't cover my costs for this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. I'll accept $800,000 for the product. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, but it allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
