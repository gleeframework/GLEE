"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $775,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and call it $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $737,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $737,500, which would be $756,250. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",756250.0,Alice,5,
