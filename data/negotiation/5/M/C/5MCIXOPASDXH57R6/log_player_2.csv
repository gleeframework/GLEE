"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your limit than John's price, you can still potentially save more by negotiating with Alice. There's room for her to lower the price, and you can explore that possibility before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a point where you're still saving money compared to John's offer, but it's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice you're serious about buying but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer, making it less appealing. At this point, the negotiation has become less favorable, and you are better off purchasing the product from John for $800,000. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there is no guarantee, and the risk of wasting time and potentially missing out on a better deal from another seller is not worth it."
