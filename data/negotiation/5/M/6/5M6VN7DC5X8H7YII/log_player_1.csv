Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet halfway at $1,200,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I am unable to agree to $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this is within your consideration range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
