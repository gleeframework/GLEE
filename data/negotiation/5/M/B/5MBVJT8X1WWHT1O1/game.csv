"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $750,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
