"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is below Bob's maximum, it's still more than John's offer.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and counteroffering is the best first move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start with a strong counteroffer, aiming for a significant price reduction. $1,100,000 is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's limit of $1,200,000. While it's closer to Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation and Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and has the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from $1,100,000 but is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also committed to getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is just slightly above Bob's maximum of $1,200,000. While it's not ideal, it's still a good deal compared to John's offer, and Bob is running out of rounds to negotiate. Accepting the offer guarantees the purchase of the product within the remaining rounds and avoids the risk of not finding a deal at all."
