Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is more than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust the price if Bob counters, while still securing a good deal for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to do $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is $130, which is above your minimum of $120. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows you to get a reasonable price for the product. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the sale to John or a prolonged negotiation isn't worth it for the potential extra $10."
