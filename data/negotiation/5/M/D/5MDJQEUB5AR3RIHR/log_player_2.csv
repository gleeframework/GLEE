"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,700? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,700 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price, hopefully closer to his target."
