"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $180. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation. This tactic aims to see how flexible Alice is and how low she might be willing to go.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable. We directly propose a price we find reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $80, we position ourselves closer to our target price ($100) than Alice's starting point ($180).  This gives us some bargaining power. 

This approach sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation where we can gradually increase our offer while trying to get Alice to lower hers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's counteroffer of $130 is a significant reduction, it remains above your $100 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to move her price down suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:** You still have the option of buying from John for $100, giving you leverage. 

You'll likely need to increase your offer in the next round, but there's a good chance you can reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair price and works for me."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Your Limit:**  You're now proposing your maximum budget of $100. This is a firm but fair stance.
* **Justification:** You've provided a simple and understandable reason for your offer â€“ it's a price you're comfortable with.
* **Pressure Point:** By sticking to your budget, you're putting a bit of pressure on Alice, especially knowing you have John as a backup option. 

It's now up to Alice to decide if she's willing to accept $100 or risk losing the sale."
