Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair price and works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:  Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his current offer of $100, which is his maximum perceived value.  It's better to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
