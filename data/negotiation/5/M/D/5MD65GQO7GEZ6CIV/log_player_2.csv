This price represents a significant value to you, as you've indicated you value it at $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $1,000,000 and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This means you'll save $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, it's not worth the risk.** If you reject the offer, you're guaranteed to pay $1,000,000 from John.  It's better to lock in the savings of $50,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
