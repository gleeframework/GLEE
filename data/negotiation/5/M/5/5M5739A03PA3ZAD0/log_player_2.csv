"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product from John for $100, so there is no reason to accept Alice's offer of $110.  You should counteroffer Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $108. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is selling the product for. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, the best option is to buy the product from John for $100."
