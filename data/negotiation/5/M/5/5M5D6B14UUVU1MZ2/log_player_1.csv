Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below your desired price, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price and a reasonable outcome considering Bob's counteroffers.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome, and risking selling to John for $120 is a gamble that may not pay off."
