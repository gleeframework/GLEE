{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price range.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I mention that the product has value to me, suggesting a willingness to pay, but still within my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While $1400000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you, and I'm prepared to reduce my asking price to $1600000. This price reflects the value we both recognize in this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target.  I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating to try and get closer to my desired price.  John's offer is always a safety net, but I'm still aiming to potentially save some money if possible."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which reflects the true value of the product to me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I clearly state my final offer, putting the ball back in Alice's court.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate that my offer reflects the product's value to me, making it a reasonable price.
* **Finality:** I use language like ""finalize this deal"" to suggest that this is my best offer and I'm ready to move forward.
