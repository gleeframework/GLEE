Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I appreciate you starting the conversation, but $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
