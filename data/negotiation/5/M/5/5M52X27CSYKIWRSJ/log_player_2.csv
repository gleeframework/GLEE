"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1350000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1325000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. John's offer is the best option at this point, as it's within my budget."
