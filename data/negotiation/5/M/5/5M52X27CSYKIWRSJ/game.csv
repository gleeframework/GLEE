"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I appreciate you starting the conversation, but $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1350000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $1200000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. If you're serious about making a deal, I think this is a good compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1325000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
