"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us while allowing me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,150,000. This still allows you a substantial gain while recognizing the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
