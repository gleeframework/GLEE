Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is strategically placed. It is:

* **Above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:**  $1,000,000 is still lower than the $1,200,000 the product is worth to Bob. This gives him room to bargain but incentivizes him to accept quickly. 

I'm aiming for a quick negotiation and a good profit.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my goal, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to compromise but not settle for too low a price.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  It demonstrates flexibility and makes it easier for Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable price and avoid a long negotiation."
