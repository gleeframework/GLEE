Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little more. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a good price for you. It's still within your budget and closer to your ideal price point.  It's a good deal, especially considering John is offering the product for $1,000,000.  There's no need to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since you're already in a good position."
