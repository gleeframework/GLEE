"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $120 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's work together to find a solution.",160.0,Alice,3,
