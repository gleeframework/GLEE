"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This will give me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also establish a starting point that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is a good deal, it's not the best I can get. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet because I'm confident I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price but I've lowered my counteroffer to be more realistic. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $180, $170 is a good price.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, I might risk Bob walking away entirely or my offer to John might expire. This deal is safe and profitable."
