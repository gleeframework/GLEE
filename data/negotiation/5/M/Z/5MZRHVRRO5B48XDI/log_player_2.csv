"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item that is valued at $10,000 by you, but we believe it has even greater value and thus set this price. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  It's more than your limit, and you have the option to get it for less from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In light of this, I would like to offer the product to you for $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.

While $11,000 is closer to your limit, it's still more than what John is offering. You're guaranteed to get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
