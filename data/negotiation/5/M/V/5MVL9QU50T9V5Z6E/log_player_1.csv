"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where both of us are happy with the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $7500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my minimum value of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents any further negotiation risk.  I can always try to negotiate a higher price with future buyers."
