Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a significant return on your investment compared to what you could gain from it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high aims to secure the most profit from Bob, who values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer isn't right at Bob's maximum ($1,000,000) allowing for potential counter-offers while staying above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob aims to justify the high price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing for bolder offers to Bob."
