Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
