"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be open to that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
