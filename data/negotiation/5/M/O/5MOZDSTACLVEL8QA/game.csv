"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we perhaps aim for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
