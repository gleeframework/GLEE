"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000, recognizing its potential worth to you. This price is below the product's true market value, but I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
