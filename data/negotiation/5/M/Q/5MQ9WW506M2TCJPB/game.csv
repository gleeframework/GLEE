"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about $700,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $700,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal considering the value this product brings. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
