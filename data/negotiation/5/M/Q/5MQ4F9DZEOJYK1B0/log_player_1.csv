Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, trying to meet halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $135. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. I believe this is a fair price, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $125 is a good price and a significant improvement over selling to John.  At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely."
