"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product, as I believe it's still a great value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I still believe the product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this deal work.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,075,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll do $1,090,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
