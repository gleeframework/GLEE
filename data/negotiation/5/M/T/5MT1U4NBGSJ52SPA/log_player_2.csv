"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's initial price ($10,000). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $8,000 maximum.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (budget limitations) can make the counteroffer seem more reasonable to Alice. 
* **Leaving Room:** We've left a gap between our offer and our maximum price, signaling that we're open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a good deal, as the product is worth $8,000 to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to our acceptable range, but we can still try to get a better deal. We are close enough to John's price that it makes sense to continue negotiating for a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between our last offer ($6,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards a favorable outcome for us. 
* **Framing:**  By using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise,"" we're positioning our offer as a reasonable solution that benefits both parties. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're getting closer to our fallback option (buying from John for $8,000), so it's a good idea to start moving towards a decision in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Alternative:** Alice has met our exact fallback price of $8,000. There's no point in rejecting this offer to try to get a lower price from Alice because it's already equal to what we can get from John.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves us from potentially lengthy negotiations that might not even result in a better price."
