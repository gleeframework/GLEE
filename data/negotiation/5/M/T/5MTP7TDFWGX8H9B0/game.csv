"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer upon considering its potential benefits to you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your position, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I could consider letting it go for $20,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $18,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $19,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",19000.0,Bob,4,
