"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, there's potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Offering $105 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $109 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has already shown willingness to compromise and Alice has also shown flexibility.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer by a smaller amount ($2 instead of the previous $4). This shows continued willingness to compromise while also trying to meet Alice halfway.  It's a tactic to potentially push Alice closer to accepting a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and accepting the offer at $108 means Bob can save $12 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of not finding a better deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gains from continuing to negotiate."
