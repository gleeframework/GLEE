"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000 for the product. This is a considerable offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's reach a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's the best offer I can make. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a deal at $915,000.
