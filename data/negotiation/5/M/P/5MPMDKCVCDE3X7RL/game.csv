"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $850,000?  That would still give you a good profit and be a great deal for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet in the middle!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
