"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $95 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to offer it to you for $90. This is higher than my initial offer and closer to what you're suggesting, while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more room to work with.  I'm prepared to pay $88 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",88.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am able to move forward with a proposal of $89 for the product. This allows us to both reach a fair agreement. Please let me know if this works for you.",89.0,Alice,5,
