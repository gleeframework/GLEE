"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are looking to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150, so it's not acceptable.
* You have an alternative with John at $150, so you can afford to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to consider $110? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to get the price down as much as possible while still potentially getting a deal. 
* Offering $110 is a significant discount from Alice's original price, but it's still above her minimum price of $80. 
* This counteroffer creates an opportunity for further negotiation while showing a genuine interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $120 is within your budget of $150.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price that's both affordable and likely better than what John would charge."
