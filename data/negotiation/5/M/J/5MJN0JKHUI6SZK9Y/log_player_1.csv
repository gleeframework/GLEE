"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $155 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $155 is still a bit low. I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'll see if I can counteroffer in a way that's more attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $155 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $165. That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is closer to what I want, I'm still hopeful that I can get a bit more for the product. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about $162? It's a small compromise on my end, and hopefully, we can finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 162}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think $162 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $158 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $158. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $158
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting close to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to drop my price to $160 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $160 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $157 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $157. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $157
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $157 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price.  I've already gone through a lot of negotiation, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's safer to sell to John at this point and guarantee myself the minimum profit."
