"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'll counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my target. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not desperate yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but I still want to stay above my minimum. I'm hoping this compromise will make Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for more.  $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I still have a few rounds to get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to try and find a middle ground.  I'm dropping my price a bit more, but I'm hoping to get closer to my target before we run out of rounds.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is exactly my minimum.  It's worth taking this deal, as further negotiation might risk losing him entirely and I'd be left with only John's offer, which is the same.  I have 4 rounds left, but the risk of getting a lower price is too high."
