Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept from John, hoping to get closer to my desired value.  Since Bob values the product at $120, this price might be high, but it gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still try to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145, which is a compromise between my desired $150 and Bob's offer of $140. This way, I'm showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll sell to John for $150 to ensure I get my desired value."
