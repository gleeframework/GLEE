"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,225,000? This price is closer to your offer, and it reflects the value of the product for me. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $1,225,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
