Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
