"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its quality and features. Would you like to purchase it from me for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $175? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $190. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product's value.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $190 is still a bit higher than my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $180. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer willing to pay closer to your original asking price.",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $180. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet at $185?",185.0,Alice,5,
