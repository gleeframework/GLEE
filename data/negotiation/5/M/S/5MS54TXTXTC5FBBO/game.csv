"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $7,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $6,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a fair deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $6,500? This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,5,
