"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum target price of $120, and I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product well worth the investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.50. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100.5 is close to my minimum target of $120, I am not willing to accept a price that is less than what John is offering. I still have 6 rounds to negotiate with Bob and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100.50 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find the product a great value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any closer to your target price, and I'm starting to think I should just go with John's offer. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $102.5 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to take a loss compared to what John is offering.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $120."
