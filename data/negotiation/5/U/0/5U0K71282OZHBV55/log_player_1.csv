Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000, slightly higher than the value Bob places on the product. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $15,500. This is a compromise that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial asking price, it's close enough to my minimum.  Given the risk of continued negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer, it's  in my best interest to accept his offer and secure a sale."
