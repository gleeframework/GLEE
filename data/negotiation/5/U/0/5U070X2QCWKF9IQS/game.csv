"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still allows me a good profit. Let's find a middle ground here. ",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 simply isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? This offer is fair and allows us both to get a decent deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to secure a better price than $1,325,000. I'm willing to drop down to $1,350,000 as a final compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
