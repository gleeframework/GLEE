Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for the price to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer, setting a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a faster deal. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his response."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, there's still a chance I could get a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product.  Given the value we've both discussed, I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000.
