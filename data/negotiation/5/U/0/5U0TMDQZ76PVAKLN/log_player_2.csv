"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to find a common ground. Let's make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and since Bob can always buy from John for $1,200,000, it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget.  He has already made a counteroffer, and there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This price is fair and allows us to close the deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product.  Given the value we've both discussed, I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000. This is a small step towards compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,315,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  He's already made several counteroffers, and it's unclear if he'll be able to get Alice to come down further.  With only a few rounds left, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for his target price of $1,200,000.  This guarantees him the product at his maximum budget and avoids further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
