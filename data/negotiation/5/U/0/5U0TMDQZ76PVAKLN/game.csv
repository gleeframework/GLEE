"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to find a common ground. Let's make this deal work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product.  Given the value we've both discussed, I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000. This is a small step towards compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay. What do you say?",1315000.0,Alice,7,
