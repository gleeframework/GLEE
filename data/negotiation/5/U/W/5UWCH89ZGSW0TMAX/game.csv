"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $140. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm already offering a good deal.  If you're serious about buying it, this is the best price I can offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'd be willing to pay $135, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll buy the product from you.",135.0,Bob,6,
