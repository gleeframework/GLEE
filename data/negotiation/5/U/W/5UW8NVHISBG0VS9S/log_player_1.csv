Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $20,000,  and I think it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't possible in a real negotiation:**  You've provided Bob's valuation for the sake of this exercise. However, Alice wouldn't have this information in a real-world scenario.
* **Starting high anchors the negotiation:** By starting with a price higher than even John's offer, Alice sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is likely to secure a price closer to her desired minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering a price significantly above John's offer provides space for potential negotiation while ensuring Alice doesn't sell herself short. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to:

* **Justify the price:**  Have strong reasons ready explaining the product's value and why the price is justified.
* **Negotiate:**  Be willing to lower the price slightly, but not below her $15,000 minimum. 
* **Walk away if necessary:** If Bob remains unwilling to meet a price that's acceptable to Alice, she always has John as a backup buyer."
