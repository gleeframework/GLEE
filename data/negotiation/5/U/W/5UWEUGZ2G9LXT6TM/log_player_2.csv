"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $13,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $13,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a strong negotiating position.
* **Reasoning:** Bob provides a reason for the lower price, making it less likely that Alice will immediately reject the offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob wants to see how flexible Alice is in her pricing and gauge her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $11,000 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has indicated flexibility. There's still room to reach a deal closer to Bob's target price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's a chance that Bob can counteroffer and potentially secure a better price than $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $12,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll offer $12,000, which is my absolute top price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Bob is now at his maximum budget, making this a clear signal of his final offer.
* **Appeal to Mutual Agreement:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price, fostering a sense of cooperation.
* **Closing the Deal:** Bob clearly states his intention to close the deal, adding pressure on Alice to accept."
