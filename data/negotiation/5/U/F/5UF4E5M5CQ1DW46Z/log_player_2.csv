"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,750, which is still below his maximum price of $12,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying the full $12,000 to John."
