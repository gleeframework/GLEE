Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By starting at $140, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still potentially attractive compared to him not having the product at all. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a final price higher than $150. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
