Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on his response, or if the negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, and it's not very close to the value I place on the product. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer. I want to try to get a price closer to my desired value, but I'll be careful not to push too hard and risk losing him as a buyer altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counter-offer. I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my desired value, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer more, I'm not sure if further negotiation will be productive.  He might not be willing to budge further, and I could end up losing him as a buyer altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me $10,750, which is a significant improvement over selling to John for $10,000."
