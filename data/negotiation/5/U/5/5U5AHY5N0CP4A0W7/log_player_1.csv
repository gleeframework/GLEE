"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 9 rounds left, and I can use this opportunity to try and negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not entirely satisfied. With 6 rounds remaining, I have some room to negotiate and push for a higher price. I believe I can still achieve a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to get as close as possible to my initial asking price of $1,800,000. With 4 rounds remaining, I have some room to negotiate and push for a higher price. I believe I can still achieve a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  Let's close this deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1250000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a point where Bob's offer is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, and with only two rounds left, there's little chance of getting significantly closer to my desired price.  

I'm confident that I can secure a sale with John for $1,200,000, which is right at my minimum threshold.  This guarantees a sale and eliminates the risk of a further stalemate with Bob."
