"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9500? I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
