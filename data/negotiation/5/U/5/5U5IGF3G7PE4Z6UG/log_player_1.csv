Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate but is still a great price for you.
* **Time Value:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies you have other options and creates a slight sense of urgency for Bob to act.
 
This strategy balances getting the best price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
