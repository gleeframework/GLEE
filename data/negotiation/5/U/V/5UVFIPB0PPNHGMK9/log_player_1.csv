{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and it's worth much more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80, which is a good start.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not going for the full $150, which gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob, so $120 is a fair price for both parties.

This strategy allows you to potentially get a higher price than $80 from John while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $90. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than your minimum, it's still less than your initial offer.  Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows you to maintain control and potentially get a higher price. It also signals to Bob that you are serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105? It's a good deal for both of us, and it's still a significant saving for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
