Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $950,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes its value to me while still giving you a profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
