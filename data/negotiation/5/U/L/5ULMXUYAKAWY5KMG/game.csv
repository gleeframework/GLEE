"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $950,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes its value to me while still giving you a profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $775,000 for the product. This price is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's close this deal now before we run out of time.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting frustrated, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one final offer to try to find a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This price is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm willing to make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,9,
