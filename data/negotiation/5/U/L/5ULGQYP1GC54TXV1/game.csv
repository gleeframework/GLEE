"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $8500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product without breaking the bank.  Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $8700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",8700.0,Alice,5,
