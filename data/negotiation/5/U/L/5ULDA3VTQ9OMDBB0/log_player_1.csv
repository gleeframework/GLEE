Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,500,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.

It's clear Bob won't budge above $1,200,000.  Since I have a guaranteed offer at that price from John, it makes the most sense to proceed with the sure thing and avoid further negotiation."
