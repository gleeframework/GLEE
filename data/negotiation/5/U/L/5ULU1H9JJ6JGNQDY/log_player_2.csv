{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $720,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $720,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $715,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $718,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $718,000 is very close to my target price and a significant improvement from previous offers.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my offer and the possibility of having to buy from John for $800,000 makes accepting this offer the best option. I've saved a substantial amount of money compared to John's price, and I believe this is a fair deal for both of us."
