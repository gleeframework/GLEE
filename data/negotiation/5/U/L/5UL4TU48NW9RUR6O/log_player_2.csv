It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $800,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and hopefully, it will open the door to further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her new offer is only $50,000 more than my counteroffer.  It's a good price, and it's better than buying from John. Accepting the offer saves me $150,000."
