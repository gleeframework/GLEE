"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds immense value to us at $1,200,000, but considering its significance to you, we aim to make it accessible. We propose to offer you the chance to own this masterpiece at a special price of $950,000. This represents a remarkable opportunity to secure a high-quality asset at a fraction of its market value. We believe this price reflects the unique value proposition and the potential benefits it offers to you. We look forward to your consideration and hope to facilitate a transaction that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She might come back with a lower price, closer to her true valuation."
