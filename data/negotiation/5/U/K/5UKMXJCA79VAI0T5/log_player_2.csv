"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $1,000,000 is above your budget, and you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get her closer to your target price of $800,000.  You could try another counteroffer, or even risk buying from John if you feel like Alice won't budge further."

Alice's offer:

I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the sale. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

You should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You can get the product from John for $800,000, so there's no need to pay more.
