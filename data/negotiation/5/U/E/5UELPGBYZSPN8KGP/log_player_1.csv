{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate. However, it's also significantly less than your minimum price, leaving room for you to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the product and your generosity, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $100. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $90 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 90}
