Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment at a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,500,000 gives Bob the impression of its high value while potentially securing a 25% profit margin for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can always come down in price if needed, with your fallback being John's offer."
