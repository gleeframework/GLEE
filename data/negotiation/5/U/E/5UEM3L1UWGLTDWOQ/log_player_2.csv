"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for your needs. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  That's a great deal, and it allows me to make a good profit as well.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and significantly less than John's offer.  Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
