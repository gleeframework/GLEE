"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, you can potentially get it for cheaper by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore if you can reach a price that is more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $95 to $90, which is a reasonable compromise.  While you might be able to get it a bit lower, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer at $90 saves you $10 compared to buying from John and is a good deal overall."
