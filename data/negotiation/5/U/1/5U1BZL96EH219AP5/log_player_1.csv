{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. I believe it's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $18000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to $19,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $18500. I hope this suggestion is within your acceptable range.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a little higher, and I'm getting close to my target price.  At this point, I think it's a good deal and I'm willing to accept. I don't want to risk losing him completely and ending up selling to John for a lower price."
