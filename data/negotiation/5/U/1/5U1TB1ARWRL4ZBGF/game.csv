"Hi Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $800,000. Let's start with that figure and see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
