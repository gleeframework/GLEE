"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob (""fantastic opportunity"") to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

This is a strategic opening move. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, but it establishes a high starting point and sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $800,000. Let's start with that figure and see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept $800,000, I'm holding out for a better deal.  

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering Bob's initial interest in the product.
* **Risk Management:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a good return, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher price with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price point that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Budget:** I'm acknowledging Bob's limitations to show I'm listening and trying to find common ground.
* **Reasoning for the Price:** I'm justifying the price by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price from the initial offer, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Openness for Further Negotiation:** The message concludes with a call for further negotiation, keeping the door open for a potential agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. 

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation as Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **Risk Management:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a good return, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher price with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price point that's closer to my minimum and still acceptable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's exactly in between our last two offers ($900,000 and $1,100,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the ""true value"" of the product to justify my price and make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Direct Approach:** I'm asking for a direct response, hoping to close the deal in this round. 

This counteroffer aims to secure my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for a quick agreement with Bob."
