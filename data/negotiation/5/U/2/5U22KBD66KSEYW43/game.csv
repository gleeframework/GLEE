"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher given its potential. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
