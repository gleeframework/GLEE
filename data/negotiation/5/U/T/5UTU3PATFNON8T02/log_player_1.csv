Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I appreciate the offer, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $12,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $12,500? That's my final offer.

You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to move much further from his $12,500 offer. It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
