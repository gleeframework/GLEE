"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $140.  Let's see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is a little too low for me. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$135 is a good deal for you, as it's still below your maximum budget of $150.  It's also more likely that Alice will agree to a price closer to $130 in the next round, but there's a chance she'll reject it and you'll end up buying from John.  Since there's always a risk involved in negotiating, it's better to accept a reasonable offer and secure the product."
