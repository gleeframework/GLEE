Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can do $125, which is as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $125. Buying from John for $120 ensures you get the product at the best possible price without further negotiation."
