"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
