"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to consider a lower price. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $100 is still not within my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
