Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his offer of $950,000.  While we might be able to negotiate him up slightly, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal."
