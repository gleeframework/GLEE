Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. This is a fair price for me, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. However, it's still considerably more than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a better price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,250. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.
