"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000. This price would allow us to close the deal quickly and fairly. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
