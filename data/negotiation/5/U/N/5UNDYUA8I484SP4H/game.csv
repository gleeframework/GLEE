"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value for me.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's still a great price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? That still leaves a good profit margin for you, and it's closer to my minimum asking price. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
