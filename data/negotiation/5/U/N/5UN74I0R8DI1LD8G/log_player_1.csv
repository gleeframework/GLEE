"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start strong and show Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price. I know Bob is likely to counteroffer, and I'm prepared for that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a better price than Bob's initial value of $1,200,000, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my price from the initial $1,700,000 offer to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility while still being within my desired price range. Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,250,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for improvement. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, as I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's below my desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm further reducing my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, but I still believe I can get a good price while staying above my minimum. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I need to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the same as his initial value, so there's no more room for negotiation. I've already reduced my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk further losses. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
