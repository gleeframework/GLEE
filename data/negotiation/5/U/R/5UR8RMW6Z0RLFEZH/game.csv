"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me.  How about we come down a bit to $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $850,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
