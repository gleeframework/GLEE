"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would significantly enhance your business or personal endeavors. After careful consideration and evaluation, I have decided to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional item at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its market value, making it an attractive proposition for you.

The product holds significant value for me, but I am confident that its worth to you exceeds $800,000, which is its estimated value to you based on our discussions. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction. By accepting this offer, you will not only secure a valuable asset but also potentially save a considerable amount compared to what others might be willing to pay.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am here to answer any questions you might have and to assist you through the process. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is below her stated value, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You have a strong alternative with John, so rejecting this offer and moving forward with John is the most financially sound decision."
