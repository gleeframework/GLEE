"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, given the product's value. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of your product, I can't agree to $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
