Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, we can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the ""value and potential."" This encourages Bob to consider benefits beyond his initial assessment. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with ""What are your thoughts?"" signaling that this is a starting point for discussion and not a final ultimatum.

By setting a high initial offer and leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of securing the best possible price from Bob, knowing she has a fallback option with John."
