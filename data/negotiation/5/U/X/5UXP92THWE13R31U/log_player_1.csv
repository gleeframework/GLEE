Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product you might be interested in for $99. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $100 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested while still securing a profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $100 to Bob might make him think she's desperate to sell and lower his perception of the product's value.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
