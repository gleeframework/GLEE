Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""special price,"" Alice subtly implies that this offer might not last, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice is guaranteed to sell the product to John for her minimum acceptable price."
