"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product is interesting, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $18,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $18,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and agree on $15,750?",15750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, Bob. I can do $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that John might be a better option...",16000.0,Alice,7,
