{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. It's above your minimum of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone, suggesting you believe in the product's value and are open to finding a fair price for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,300,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,350,000 for the product. This price still offers you a great deal, and it allows me to achieve my target.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
