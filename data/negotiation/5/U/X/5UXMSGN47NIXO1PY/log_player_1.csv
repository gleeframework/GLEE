Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully and respond promptly."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob values the product higher than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency encourages Bob to make a decision quickly."
