"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal for its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:** My message is positive and confident, aiming to establish a good starting point.
* **Value Emphasis:** I emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial price is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for 20% reduction before hitting my minimum. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price, but also provides a safety net by offering a price that is significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay $950000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, which is enough time to negotiate further.  Selling to John is not an attractive option right now as it is significantly below my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and I'll come down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows for a significant profit for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but still maintaining a higher price than his offer. 
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Appeal:** I subtly remind him of the potential profit by stating that the price still allows for a ""significant profit.""

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Push for a Higher Price:**  I'm trying to close the gap between our desired prices.
* **Maintain Control:**  I'm still in the driver's seat, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Stay Above John's Offer:** I'm still well above my minimum selling price to John."
