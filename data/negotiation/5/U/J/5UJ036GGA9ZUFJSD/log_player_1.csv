{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $105 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll try to counter Bob's offer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $92.50? That would be a great compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $92.50.  This is still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate."
