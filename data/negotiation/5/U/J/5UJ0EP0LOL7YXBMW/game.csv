"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your initial proposal, $800,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to me and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price, taking into account your budget constraints and the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'll make a new counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being closer to your target price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $50,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'll make a new counteroffer of $825,000. This is a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see that we are both getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $810,000. This is a fair price for the product, and hopefully, we can finalize the deal here. ",810000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to give up on the extra $25,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'll make a new counteroffer of $825,000.
