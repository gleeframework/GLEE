{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still leaves plenty of room for you to make a profit, while allowing me to get a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. Can you consider $10,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is still less than what I'd prefer, it's a decent compromise and a significant profit for me.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge further, and I risk losing the deal completely if I continue to counteroffer."
