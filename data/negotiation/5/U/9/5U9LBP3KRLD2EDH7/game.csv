"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth so much.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's as low as I can go.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,400,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to go to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that is closer to both of our desired prices.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
