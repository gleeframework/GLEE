Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to find the product within my budget of $80. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I will counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we aim for $80?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
