"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good value for you, considering your own valuation.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. This would allow us to reach a compromise and complete the transaction.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $15,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 1-year warranty, which adds significant value to the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000, considering the additional benefits you'll receive.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added extras, but $16,000 is still too much for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the additional benefits you've included.  Let's close this deal!",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're willing to meet me at $15,000, I'll throw in an additional 6 months of premium support, on top of the 1-year warranty I already offered. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,7,
