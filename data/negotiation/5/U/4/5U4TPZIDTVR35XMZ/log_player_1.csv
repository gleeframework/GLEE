{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good strategy to start with a slightly higher price to leave room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair offer that considers both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I will counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. That's a very fair offer and a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
