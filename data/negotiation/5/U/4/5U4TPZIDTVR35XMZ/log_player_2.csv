"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,450,000 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly aiming for a price above her own valuation, so we should try to bring the price down closer to the $1,200,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair offer that considers both our positions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** We're beginning with a strong counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief, friendly explanation helps keep the negotiation collaborative and avoids coming across as too aggressive.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** Aiming for a price closer to the midpoint between Alice's valuation ($1,200,000) and our maximum ($1,500,000) is a strategic starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However, she's only moved $100,000 from her initial offer. We're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I believe there's room for her to come down further, so I'll reject and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. That's a very fair offer and a good compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer signals willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. We're essentially splitting the difference between her last offer and ours.
* **Firm but Fair Language:** The message maintains a positive tone but clearly states our position and the attractiveness of the offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  While we haven't explicitly mentioned John, Alice knows we have other options.  The longer the negotiation goes, the more likely we are to walk away and take the sure thing.  This offer adds subtle time pressure without resorting to threats."
