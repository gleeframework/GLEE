Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $12,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my target price.  How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both room to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer for $10,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and it avoids the risk of losing out to John or having to continue negotiating for another six rounds."
