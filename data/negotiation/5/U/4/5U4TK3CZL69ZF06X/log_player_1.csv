Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Sense of urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **Justification:** While vague, mentioning ""unique value proposition"" aims to plant a seed of curiosity and potential value that Bob might not have considered initially.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Information is key:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or financial limitations. More information could lead to a more tailored approach.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright and go with John. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price justifies the risk."
