"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110.  I think it would be perfect for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Because Alice's offer is quite high considering your maximum budget and John's offer, it's worth negotiating.  You might be able to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price closer to your target while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  How about we split the difference and meet at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting you in the middle, and $100 is a reasonable price, saving you $20 off your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results."
