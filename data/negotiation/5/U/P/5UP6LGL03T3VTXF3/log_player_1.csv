Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Friendly approach:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leave room for counteroffer:**  By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm signaling I'm open to a counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to be firm in negotiations and walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $115 is a little too steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $100. Accepting this would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for better deal:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest. I can potentially negotiate a higher price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me the leverage to reject low offers and pursue a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his initial offer but still above his perceived value. 
* **Highlight value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with ""Let me know what you think!"" to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Keep John in mind:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price ($120), allowing me to walk away if Bob rejects it and pursue the deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. How about $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and below his own perceived value of $100.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can likely get a better price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. 
* **John is a secure option:**  I have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $120, which gives me the confidence to hold out for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we both agree on. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that is right in the middle of my previous offer ($105) and Bob's latest offer ($97).
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the compromise and fairness of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **John as Backup:**  While $100 is still above my minimum, I have John as a guaranteed sale at $120, allowing me to walk away if Bob rejects this final offer."
