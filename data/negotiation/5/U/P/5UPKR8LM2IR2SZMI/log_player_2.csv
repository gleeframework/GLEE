"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
