""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically helps justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""we can discuss further"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in a counter-offer.

By aiming high but remaining open to negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of securing the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
