"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than John's price. While her message tries to inflate the product's value, you have a backup option at a much better price point. Rejecting her offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to proceed with John."
