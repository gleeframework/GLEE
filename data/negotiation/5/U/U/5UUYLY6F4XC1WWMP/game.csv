"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is far too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and what it can do for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant value it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still more than double what I'm looking to spend. If you're willing to get closer to the $700,000 range, I think we could make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
