Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and what it can do for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant value it offers."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still more than double what I'm looking to spend. If you're willing to get closer to the $700,000 range, I think we could make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.

While negotiating with Bob might eventually lead to a sale, his offer is too far below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price.  It's time to move on from Bob and finalize the deal with John."
