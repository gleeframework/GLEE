Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. I'm confident it's worth a lot to the right person.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $150 is a good starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value can make Bob more interested. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will pay $100 gives you a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, you can always switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$120 is still above your minimum:** While Bob's offer is lower than your initial ask, it's still above your $100 minimum. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to go higher with a counteroffer.
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should now send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your initial $150. Be prepared to be flexible, but don't settle for too low of a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $120 is a little low for me at this point, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $135 shows you're willing to negotiate, while still keeping the price above your minimum.
* **Middle Ground:**  Meeting in the middle suggests a fair deal for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone can help keep the negotiation going. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, great! You've successfully negotiated a price above your minimum. 
* If Bob rejects, you can either make another counteroffer or sell to John for $100, depending on your confidence in a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe that $120 would be a fair price for the product. Could we meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 away from your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Upside:**  There's a chance Bob won't budge further, and you risk losing the sale if you keep rejecting. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and it's not guaranteed to lead to a significantly higher price. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is close to your minimum and saves time and energy. While you could try to push for a higher price, the potential gain may not outweigh the risk of losing the sale."
