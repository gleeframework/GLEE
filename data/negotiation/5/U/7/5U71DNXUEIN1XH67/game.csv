"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $16,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
