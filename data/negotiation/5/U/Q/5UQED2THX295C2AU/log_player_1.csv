Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and my other interested parties, I'm proposing a price of $16,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than $15,000 but lower than $20,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal for you while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
