Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10000 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $10000. Considering this, I propose a starting price of $9500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
