"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the value and potential benefits for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:**  A $100 offer allows for some back and forth without immediately reaching my minimum acceptable price or scaring Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.** While it's closer than Bob's initial offer, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **It's early in the negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left to try and get a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to hold out for a higher price. This may incentivize Bob to come up with a more competitive offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $95? It's a fair compromise that still allows you to get a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $95, which is halfway between his last offer and my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still pursuing a price closer to my desired range.
* **Compromise:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Value proposition:** I reemphasize the value of the product, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal.

By using a moderate counteroffer and a positive message, I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $92 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Early in the negotiation:** I still have 6 rounds left to try and get a better deal.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $120 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm committed to getting a price that reflects the product's value. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still not able to go lower than $97. This offer is fair considering the quality and value of the product. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm increasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount ($5) than in the previous round. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Maintain position:** I'm maintaining my stance that $97 is the lowest I'm willing to go, signaling that I'm not desperate to close the deal. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still giving me some leverage to potentially reach a more favorable price in the upcoming rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $94 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $94 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited time:** We're halfway through the negotiation, and I need to get closer to my target price.
* **John's offer is always an option:** If I don't reach an agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John for $120.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  This may encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round or potentially lead to a faster decision to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $96, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 96}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm lowering my offer by only $1, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my desired range. This shows willingness to compromise without giving up too much.
* **Focus on agreement:** I emphasize finding a ""solution that works for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Direct approach:**  I keep the message concise and focused on the offer, making it clear that I'm ready to move forward if Bob accepts.

With only 3 rounds left, I need to start moving closer to a deal. This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, and Bob has only offered $92, still significantly below my minimum of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  With only 2 rounds left, there's not enough time to make significant progress toward a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to prioritize getting a fair price for my product. Selling to John is the most sensible choice at this point."
