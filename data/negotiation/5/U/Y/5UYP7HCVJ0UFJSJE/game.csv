"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $135. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Would you be willing to accept that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. Would you be willing to accept that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
