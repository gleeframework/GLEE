"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000, which is halfway between my maximum budget of $1,200,000 and Alice's offer of $1,400,000.
* **Negotiation:** This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also demonstrates my serious intent to buy the product at a price that's reasonable for me.
* **Alternative:** Remember, I can always buy from John for $1,200,000, so this counteroffer gives Alice some incentive to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. By rejecting the offer, I maintain the pressure on Alice to come down further, potentially making a counteroffer closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** Alice came down by $20,000, so I'm increasing my offer by $50,000. This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still pushing for a better price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm now only $80,000 above my maximum budget. This should make the offer appealing to Alice while still keeping me within a reasonable range.
* **Alternative:** Remember, I have the option of buying from John, so Alice needs to be competitive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is only $150,000 over my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to save more, I'm now within a reasonable margin and  I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate. It's likely Alice won't go much lower, and I could end up paying more if I buy from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is still acceptable."
