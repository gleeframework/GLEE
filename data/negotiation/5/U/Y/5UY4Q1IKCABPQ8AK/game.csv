"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This price is still a fair reflection of its worth, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
