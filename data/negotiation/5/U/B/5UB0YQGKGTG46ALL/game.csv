"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in it and we can work out a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit hesitant. Could we try for $1,075,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. How about we meet at $1,125,000? I think that's the lowest I can go and still feel good about the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
