"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $10,500. I can do $11,500 for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This way, we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $11,000. I can meet you halfway, but I need $11,750. It's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little higher than where I want to be. Let's meet in the middle again, how about $11,500?  It's a fair price, and we can both be done with this negotiation.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
