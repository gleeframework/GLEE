You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

You're still getting a better deal with John at $15,000 than accepting $11,500 from Alice.  Let's see if you can get Alice to come down a bit more."

You're still better off buying from John, but let's see if we can squeeze Alice down a little further.  $11,750 is still a bit high for you.  Let's see if you can negotiate a little lower."

Alice has come back up to $12,000.  You're better off buying from John at $15,000. You've tried negotiating with Alice, and it seems like she's not willing to go lower.  It's time to move on."
