Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value this product holds for me. However,  $900,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
