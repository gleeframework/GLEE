"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value this product holds for me. However,  $900,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still looking to get as close to the true value of the product as possible. Considering its worth $1,200,000 to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
