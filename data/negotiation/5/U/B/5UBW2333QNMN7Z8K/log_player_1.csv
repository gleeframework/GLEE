Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm mentioning the ""value"" of the product without revealing specifics, creating intrigue.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to determine if he's a serious buyer or just trying to haggle.
* **Counteroffers:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll consider his price and decide if it's acceptable. I'll likely aim for a price closer to my minimum if he's too far off. 
* **John's Option:** I'll always keep John's offer in mind. If the negotiations with Bob drag on or become too tedious, I'll consider taking the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $15000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?  I'm confident this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Budget:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is Money:** Negotiating further would risk losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the minimum profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Close the Deal:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
