# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!

{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show good faith. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,050,000 is better than her original offer, it's still over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. It's still above my initial offer, and it's significantly closer to your desired price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure I get a fair return.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this price.  If we can't, I'm ready to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice has dug in and is unwilling to come down any further.  While Bob might be able to get Alice to budge a little more, it's likely to take more than the remaining rounds to reach a satisfactory price.  Since John is offering the product for $800,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the most sensible option at this point."
