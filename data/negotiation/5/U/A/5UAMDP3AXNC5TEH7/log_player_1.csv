Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly hint at the product's worth without explicitly revealing your minimum price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to hearing your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue, making a counter-offer more likely.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob immediately. It's your leverage if negotiations falter. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any information he reveals during the negotiation process."
