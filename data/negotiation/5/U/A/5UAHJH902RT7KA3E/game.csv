"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This product is truly worth it, and I believe it will be valuable to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
