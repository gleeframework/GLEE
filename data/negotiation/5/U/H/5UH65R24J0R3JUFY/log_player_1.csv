Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. This price is fair given the value of the product to you and the market value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose $9,100 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $9,500, Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close. We've been going back and forth, and accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice. It's only $400 less than my initial offer, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm happy with this outcome, as it's a significant profit for me."
