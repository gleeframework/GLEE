"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about $80?  I think that's a fair offer considering your original asking price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $80 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've invested a lot of time and effort into this product, and I think it's worth more than that. How about we try again? I'm willing to offer it to you for $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your position.  I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $82?",82.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $82. How about we try $83? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",83.0,Alice,7,
