"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more to me than that, and I need to make sure I get a fair price.  I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $13,000?  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is more reasonable. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",11500.0,Bob,4,
