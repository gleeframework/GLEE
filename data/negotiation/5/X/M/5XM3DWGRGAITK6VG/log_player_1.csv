Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $870,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I believe I can still negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $870,000 is still a bit low for me. How about $890,000? This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still giving you a substantial discount. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $860,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a little more. We have several rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to $880,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire with only two rounds left. While I still believe I can get a slightly better price from Bob, the risk is too high.  He's not budging from his offer, and we're getting closer to my minimum.  To ensure a guaranteed sale, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  It's not ideal, but it's still a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
