"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a discount from her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
