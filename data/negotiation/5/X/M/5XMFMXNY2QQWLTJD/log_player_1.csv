Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I highlight the product's value and emphasize the discount to make the offer more appealing.  I also leave room for negotiation without revealing my minimum acceptable price.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  

* By offering a lower price than my minimum, I increase the chance of Bob accepting.
*  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.

This approach balances risk and reward, allowing for a potential higher profit while still guaranteeing a reasonable outcome."
