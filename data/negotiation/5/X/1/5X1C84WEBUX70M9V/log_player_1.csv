Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000 to be satisfied.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer of $800,000 from John. 

By offering $1,200,000, I'm:

* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob has a potential $300,000 in savings if he accepts.
* **Maximizing my Potential Profit:** This price is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a high probability of Bob accepting the offer."
