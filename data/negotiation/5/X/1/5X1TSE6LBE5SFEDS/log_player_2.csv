"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to go lower.** You gain information by testing the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant, but it's still within your budget. This signals your seriousness about getting a good deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's serious about selling, she might be open to a lower price.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  You've still left room for Alice to counter at a price you might find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:**  She's moved from $5,000 to $4,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **There's still room for improvement:** You're still comfortable with the price dropping further. 
* **Gaining information:**  By rejecting, you can potentially get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer of $3,000 and Alice's current offer of $4,000.  It shows you're willing to compromise but still want a good deal.
* **Demonstrating commitment:**  By offering a higher price than before, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product and are willing to meet her halfway.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will reveal whether Alice is willing to budge further or if she's firm on $4,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to your target:** Alice's offer of $4,200 is a significant drop from her initial $5,000 and only $300 away from your last counteroffer.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation process.  Continuing to reject offers risks losing a good deal and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Potential for counteroffers:** Even though you're accepting, there's a chance Alice might counter with a lower price after you accept. This is a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk at this point."
