# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
