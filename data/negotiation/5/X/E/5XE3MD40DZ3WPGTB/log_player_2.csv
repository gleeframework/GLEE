# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a better price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,120,000. Considering the product's value to you and my own valuation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,080,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $1,080,000, which is within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and also lower than his initial counteroffer of $1,050,000.  It's a good compromise and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting the offer saves Bob $120,000 compared to buying from John."
