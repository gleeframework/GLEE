Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,025,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a significant jump, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  My final offer is $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and keeps it within a reasonable range for both of us. What do you say?

Alice has come down to John's price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and it's not worth risking losing the deal at this point."
