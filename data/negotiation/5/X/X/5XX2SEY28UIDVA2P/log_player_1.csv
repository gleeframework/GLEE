Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product without revealing too much], and I'm offering it to you for $200. I know it's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$200** is a starting point that is higher than your minimum price of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially start a conversation.
* **Not revealing too much about the product** keeps some mystery and potentially makes Bob more interested in learning more.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, you increase your chances of getting closer to your desired price.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer, leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Provide a backup plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, ensuring you won't lose money."
