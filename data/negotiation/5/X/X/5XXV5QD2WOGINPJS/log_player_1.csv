Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a very competitive offer considering the product's value. I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are getting close to the point where the difference with John's offer is negligible. Accepting $1,025,000 now ensures a good deal without risking losing Bob altogether and having to settle for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
