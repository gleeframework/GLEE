"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $450,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $500,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth.
