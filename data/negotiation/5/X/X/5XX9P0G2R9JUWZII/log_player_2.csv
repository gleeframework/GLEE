"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a good starting offer from Alice, but there's plenty of room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  This product looks great, but $600,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $400,000?"",
""product_price"": 400000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate.  I'll hold firm for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $450,000 is the highest I can go right now. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 450000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $450,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $500,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely I'll get much further.  $500,000 is a significant savings from both her original offer and John's price."
