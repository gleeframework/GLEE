"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
