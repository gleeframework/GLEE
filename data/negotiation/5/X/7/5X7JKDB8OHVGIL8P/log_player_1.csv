Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to buy the product for $100. This sets my baseline and helps me avoid accepting an offer lower than what I can get elsewhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $100 matches my baseline, I know the product is worth more to him. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a better price before accepting his offer or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. However, the product's value is higher to me than your current offer.  Would you consider $108?"", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying firm that the product is worth more than $100. $108 represents a compromise that still gives me a profit margin.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** By countering, I'm signaling that I'm willing to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned it, each round implies that time is passing.  I want to close the deal with Bob ideally but need to be mindful of potentially losing the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am still unable to meet at $108. My maximum offer remains at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated his maximum offer twice now.  It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation might be fruitless and could risk losing both Bob and John as potential buyers. 
* **Profitable Sale:** While not ideal, $100 is still a profit over my minimum and better than losing the sale altogether."
