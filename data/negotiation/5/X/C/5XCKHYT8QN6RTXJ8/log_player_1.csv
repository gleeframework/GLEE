"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* I'm setting the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my valuation.
* **There's still time.**  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob before selling to John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $100 to $95. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging, showing I'm open to reaching an agreement. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially sway his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob before resorting to selling to John. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target:** By rejecting, I can counter with a slightly higher offer to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price. While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we split the difference at $92.50? That way, we both get a good deal! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefit for both of us – ""we both get a good deal"" – to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Time is running out:** While I still have 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially losing out on a higher offer from John.  
* **Maintaining a fair price:** $92.50 is still above my minimum price of $120, but it's getting closer to Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $92.50. How about $87.50? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  I have only 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer is still well below my minimum price of $120. 
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further concessions and a potentially lower final price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is significantly better than the current offer from Bob.

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of ending up with a lower price and the limited time remaining make selling to John the best choice."
