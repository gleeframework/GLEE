Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be of significant value to you. I'm asking for $925,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential worth to your business. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have a significant advantage knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially still get a price higher than John's offer.
* **The ""Fair Price"" Angle:** By framing the price as ""fair"" and highlighting the product's value to Bob, you create a stronger argument. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
