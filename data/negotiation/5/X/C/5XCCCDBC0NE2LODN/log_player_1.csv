Bob's offer:

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. He's not moving significantly towards your minimum price, and his mention of buying from John for $800,000 seems like a bluff to pressure you. You have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John, which surpasses any of Bob's offers."
