"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, the product's inherent value and potential for your business warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise and acknowledges the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  My final offer is $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I think this is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping you can meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
