"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more like $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a great price for a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
