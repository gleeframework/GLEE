"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worthwhile to try and negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. This creates room for bargaining and hopefully leads to a price closer to your desired $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still above your desired price of $8,000, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $12,000. Given that John is selling the same product for $8,000, you have the option of accepting Alice's offer and saving $500, or purchasing from John.  However, it's unlikely that you'll be able to get Alice to drop her price further. It's more advantageous to accept her current offer and save some money."
