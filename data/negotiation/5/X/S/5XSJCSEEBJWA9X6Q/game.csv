"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500?  This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
