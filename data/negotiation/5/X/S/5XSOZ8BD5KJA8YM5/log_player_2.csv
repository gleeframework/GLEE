Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 just isn't enough for me to move on this. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm willing to meet you at $840,000. This is a final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $840,000. Her language suggests she's firm on this price. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, saving you $40,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
