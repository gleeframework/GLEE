"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my current assessment, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise, considering its potential benefits and my available resources.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 falls short of accurately reflecting the product's true value and potential impact on your business.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a revised price of $2,000,000.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the significant worth of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my available budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground here.  I'm also very keen on seeing this deal go through and believe in the immense value this product will bring to your business. To meet you closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This revised offer reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're committed to this deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This price represents my absolute maximum, and I believe it reflects the value we've both agreed this product possesses. Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
