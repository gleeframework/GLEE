"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $16,000.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to do right now. How about we settle at $17,000? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can make this work.",17000.0,Bob,4,
