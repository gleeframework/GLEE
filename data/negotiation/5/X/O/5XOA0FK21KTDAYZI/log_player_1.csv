Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start negotiations from a strong position.  This also leaves room for me to adjust my price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with that amount. I believe I can potentially get more. I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer to $1,750,000. This allows me to make a profit while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'll accept this offer to maximize my profit."
