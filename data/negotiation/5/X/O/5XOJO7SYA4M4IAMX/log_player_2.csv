"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's still within Bob's budget and offers a significant saving compared to buying from John. While there might be a chance to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
