Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($120) but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm not going all the way to $120 to give Bob some room to bargain and potentially agree to a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Politeness:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($120) and even my initial offer ($110).**  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **There's potential for negotiation:** I can make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but still showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer ($90) is halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($60), showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid confrontation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $75 is closer to my minimum, I can likely still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** If the negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can still sell to John for $120, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85, but that's my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious about $85 being my final price. This creates pressure for him to make a decision.
* **Compromise:**  I'm continuing to compromise, moving from my previous offer of $90 to $85, but staying above my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Value Justification:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive, But Firm Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone but emphasizing that this is my final offer to demonstrate that I'm committed to this price."
