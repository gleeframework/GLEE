"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer gives me room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but makes it clear I'm looking for a substantial discount.
* **Strategic Goal:**  I want to see how flexible Alice is on price. If she completely rejects this low offer, I'll know I need to increase significantly or consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice lowered her price, $90 is still more than I'm willing to spend. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to meet closer to my budget. I'll try one more time before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $75, I'm splitting the difference between her latest offer ($90) and my previous counteroffer ($60). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards my target price.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** I'm implying that this is a strong offer, but I'm leaving myself a tiny bit of wiggle room in case Alice is very resistant.  I'm getting close to taking John's offer if she doesn't budge. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes fairness and finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85, but that's my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:**  Alice is firm at $85, and I'm unwilling to go over $80. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed option with John at my target price. 
* **No Point in Haggling:** Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to close the $5 gap. It's time to move on and take the sure thing."
