"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This leaves us both with a comfortable profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.
