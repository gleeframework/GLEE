"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $17,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's value.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

Bob is going to start with a lowball offer, aiming for his maximum value.  He knows Alice is motivated to sell, so this might be a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's value, it's still higher.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000,  it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

Bob is going to increase his offer, but only slightly. He wants to show Alice he's serious about negotiating, but he's still trying to stay below his maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is only $2,000 more than Bob's maximum value. It's likely that further negotiation won't get Alice much lower, and Bob could end up losing the deal with Alice to another buyer. It's a good deal for Bob, considering he could buy it from John for $10,000."
