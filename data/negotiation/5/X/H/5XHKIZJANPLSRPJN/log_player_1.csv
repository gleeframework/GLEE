I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations. It gives me room to negotiate down and still get a price closer to my minimum. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I have a backup plan if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. I will proceed with a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still higher than what Bob offered, but closer to his offer. I hope this will encourage him to come up on his price."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because it's still lower than my minimum. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to go below $13,000 yet. I'll send another counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $12,000.  This is a significant concession, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows him my willingness to compromise while still staying within my acceptable range."
