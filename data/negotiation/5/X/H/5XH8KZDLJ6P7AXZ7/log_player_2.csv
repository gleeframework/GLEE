"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $300,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer tests Alice's willingness to compromise and signals that Bob is serious about acquiring the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $350,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's price. While further negotiation is possible, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further rounds of negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations altogether."
