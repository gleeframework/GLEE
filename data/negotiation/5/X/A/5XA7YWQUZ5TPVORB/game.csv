"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
