"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the impact it could have on your operations, I propose a price of $11500 for the product. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the high demand and unique features of the product. I'm confident this offer presents a mutually beneficial opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $10,000."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its potential. However, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within my valuation range. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a price of $11000 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on the product and the benefits it offers to your business. I hope this proposal aligns more closely with your budget while still allowing us to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has lowered her price from $11,500 to $11,000, indicating she's willing to compromise.  Bob can likely push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After reviewing your latest offer, I am prepared to consider a price of $10900 for the product. This figure aims to find a balance between the value we place on the product and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is more acceptable and allows us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,900, which is only $400 above Bob's last counteroffer of $10,500.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer again.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that is significantly lower than what John is offering."
