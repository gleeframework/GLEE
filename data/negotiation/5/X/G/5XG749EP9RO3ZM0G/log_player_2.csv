"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe its true value might be even higher for the right buyer.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $1000000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You're better off waiting to see if John's offer is still available."
