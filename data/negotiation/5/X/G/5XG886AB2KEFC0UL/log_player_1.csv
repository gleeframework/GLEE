Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by pushing for more."
