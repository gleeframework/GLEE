"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $11,100.  It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford.",11100.0,Bob,4,
