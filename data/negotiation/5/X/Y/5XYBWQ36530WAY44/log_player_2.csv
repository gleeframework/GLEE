"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $11,100.  It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 11100}
