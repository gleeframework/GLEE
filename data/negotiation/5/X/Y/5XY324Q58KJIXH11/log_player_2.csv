"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can find a price closer to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This price would still allow you to make a significant profit, while keeping the deal within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my desired price point. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's worth exploring further negotiation to see if we can get the price down even further.  I'll continue to try and find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a good compromise. This price would still allow you to make a profit and would be a more comfortable price point for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is still lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to accept $975,000 to finalize the deal quickly. This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is a good compromise. It's still within my budget and allows me to save a significant amount compared to the initial offer or buying from John.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, Alice will stick to her final offer, and I'd be forced to either buy from John or risk losing the product altogether."
