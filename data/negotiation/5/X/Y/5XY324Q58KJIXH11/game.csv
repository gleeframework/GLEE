"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This price would still allow you to make a significant profit, while keeping the deal within my spending limit.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a good compromise. This price would still allow you to make a profit and would be a more comfortable price point for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is still lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to accept $975,000 to finalize the deal quickly. This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",975000.0,Alice,5,
