"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This will give me room to negotiate downwards while still maximizing my profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to secure a decent price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Could we meet in the middle again at $1,100,000? That would be a fair price for both of us and would let us close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than what I need. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Could we settle on $1,200,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. This would be a win for both of us - I get a fair price for my product, and you get a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still looking to stay around $1,100,000. Could we meet halfway again at $1,175,000? This would be a win-win and let us finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum value with Bob's offer, but there's still a gap.  However, we're in round 8, and I don't have much room to negotiate further. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
