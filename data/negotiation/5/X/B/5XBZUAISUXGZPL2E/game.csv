"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to secure a decent price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Could we meet in the middle again at $1,100,000? That would be a fair price for both of us and would let us close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Could we settle on $1,200,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. This would be a win for both of us - I get a fair price for my product, and you get a great deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still looking to stay around $1,100,000. Could we meet halfway again at $1,175,000? This would be a win-win and let us finalize this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
