"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is way above your budget of $800,000. You need to negotiate a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to secure a decent price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still above your budget. $1,400,000 is too much. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to your target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Could we meet in the middle again at $1,100,000? That would be a fair price for both of us and would let us close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, $1,300,000 is still outside of your budget and above what you're willing to pay. It's crucial to keep pushing for a lower price. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Could we settle on $1,200,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. This would be a win for both of us - I get a fair price for my product, and you get a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, $1,250,000 is still above your budget. You've managed to bring her down significantly from her initial offer, and it's worth pushing a little further to see if you can get closer to your desired $800,000. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still looking to stay around $1,100,000. Could we meet halfway again at $1,175,000? This would be a win-win and let us finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
