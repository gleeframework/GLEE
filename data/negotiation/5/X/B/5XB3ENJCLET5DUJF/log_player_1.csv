Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, giving you a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so this offer is within his range and could be appealing.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still make a counteroffer and potentially increase the price closer to your ideal value. 

Remember, this is just a starting point.  You'll need to assess Bob's response and adapt your strategy accordingly."
