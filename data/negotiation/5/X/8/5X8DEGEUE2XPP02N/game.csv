"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $7,500 is closer, but still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,250. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway. Would you consider $7,250?",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for working with me. $7,250 is still a tough pill to swallow, I could meet you at $7,100.  This is my final offer, as I think it's more than fair.",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $7,200. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Would you consider $7,200?",7200.0,Alice,7,
