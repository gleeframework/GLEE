(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is above your budget, and you can always buy from John for $8,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit too high. You can try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,200. I'm willing to come down to $8,400, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,400 is getting closer to your goal, it's still not within your budget. You can try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more. It's worth trying to save that extra $400."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,400.  I'm willing to go up to $8,300, which is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 8300}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8,300, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to come down to $8,350, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
