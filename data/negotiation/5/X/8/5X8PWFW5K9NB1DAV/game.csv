,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're open to it.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,200. I'm willing to come down to $8,400, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,400.  I'm willing to go up to $8,300, which is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to consider my other options.",8300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8,300, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to come down to $8,350, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",8350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product, I'm still only able to offer $8,300. If you're not willing to accept that price, I'll have to look at other options.",8300.0,Bob,8,
