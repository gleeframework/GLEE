"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth significantly more to me than Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. It's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue negotiating, hoping to reach a more favorable outcome.  There are still many rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay it.  I'm willing to go no lower, but I'm still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and we've reached a point where negotiation seems unlikely to lead to a better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and accept the guaranteed offer from John. It's a significant amount, and it's in my best interest to secure the sale."
