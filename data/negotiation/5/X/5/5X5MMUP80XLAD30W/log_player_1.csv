Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price point with another counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession to get the deal done.
