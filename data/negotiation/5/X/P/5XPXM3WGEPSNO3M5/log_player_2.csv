Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm happy to consider your offer, but I think $1300000 is a bit too low for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to offer $1,325,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1325000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive support package worth $25000. So, the total value you'll get is $1350000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
