"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm happy to consider your offer, but I think $1300000 is a bit too low for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to offer $1325000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1325000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive support package worth $25000. So, the total value you'll get is $1350000. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
