"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering our shared goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $700,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer $650,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",675000.0,Alice,5,
