"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the condition of the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested. $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and $13,000 is a good price. It's lower than what he'd pay John, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Alice's previous offer.  There's always a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting his offer again and potentially increasing the price is too high. Accepting the offer is the safest and most cost-effective option at this point."
