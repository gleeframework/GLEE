"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm asking for $95, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but Alice is asking for $95. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate since the product is worth $80 to Alice. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $90.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $100 to you.  Let's find a price that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's lowered the price, it's still above your ideal price point of $85.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's still potential to get a better deal. 

It's better to try another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
