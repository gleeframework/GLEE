"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm asking for $95, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $90.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $100 to you.  Let's find a price that works for both of us!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That way we both get a good price.",87.5,Bob,4,
