``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe $10000 would be a fair price for it considering its condition and features. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm willing to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you taking interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me considering the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to negotiation to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your prompt response. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $10000. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been firm on his offer of $10,000, which is below my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go any higher.  To avoid further haggling, it's best to sell to John for $12,000, securing a price that meets my minimum requirement."
