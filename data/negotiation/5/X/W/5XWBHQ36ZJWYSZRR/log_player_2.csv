Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500 for the product? I believe this offers a fair compromise considering both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's still below your maximum price of $12,000, and you've already successfully negotiated down from the initial $10,000.
* There's a risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up paying more, or not getting a deal at all.
* Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price, and you can move on to other things."
