"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000 and even less than what I offered in the previous round. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I want to see if I can get him closer to $10,000.  We have time left for negotiation, so I'm not ready to accept his offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000.  This is a compromise, but still a fair price given the product's value to me.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds left,  Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my desired price point.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000.  It's better to secure that sale now than to risk further negotiation with Bob that may not yield a satisfactory outcome."
