"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, it's still cheaper than buying it from John. 
* **You want to save money:** Your goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While this is a ""one-time offer,"" there might be room to negotiate further with Alice, but even if you can't, the $950,000 price is still the best option."
