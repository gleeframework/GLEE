Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you something truly unique.  While I have other interested parties, I believe this product would be particularly valuable to you. I'm willing to make a special offer just for you, how about $795,000?"",
""product_price"": 795000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to sell to Bob for a slightly lower price and still make a significant profit. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, potentially making him more receptive to the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $795,000 is just below Bob's perceived value ($800,000), making it more tempting for him to accept. It also provides a good buffer above my minimum acceptable price."
