Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs and I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price within reason maximizes potential profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob provides leverage for a higher price than John's offer.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,100,000) leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses a confident tone to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer without feeling lowballed.

This strategy balances risk and reward. While a higher offer could potentially be rejected, the potential gain from Bob accepting justifies the slightly bolder approach."
