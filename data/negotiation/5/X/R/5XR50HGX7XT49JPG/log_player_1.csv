"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome ($120) than the absolute minimum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $100, I anticipate Bob might counteroffer, which gives us a chance to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my goal, potentially leading to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good price, I'm hoping for a bit closer to my asking price. I'd be willing to accept $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not going down to Bob's price, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a slight discount from my initial offer. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Staying friendly and encouraging keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** $95 still leaves some space for Bob to counter if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $92. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  $92 is very close to my desired price point of $95, and it's a significant improvement over John's offer of $80. 
* **Limited rounds:** We're already on round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to sell to John. 
* **Potential for future deals:** Even if I get a slightly lower price this time, it's possible that Bob will be more willing to negotiate with me in the future, knowing I'm a reasonable seller."
