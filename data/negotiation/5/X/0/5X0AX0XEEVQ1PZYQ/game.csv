"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value exceeding your investment. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering its value to you, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. How about we try $1,050,000?  This allows both of us to gain a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to finalize the deal, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go at this point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
