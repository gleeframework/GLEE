Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering $9,500 as a counteroffer.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still leaves me with some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than I initially hoped, it's still higher than my minimum value and a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000. It's important to acknowledge that negotiation is a process of compromise, and this offer seems like a fair compromise."
