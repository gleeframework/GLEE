"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Let's talk, I'm confident we can come to an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate down from a price that's already above your maximum. While her message is friendly, it's in your best interest to see if she'll come down further. You have the backup option of buying from John at $12,000, so there's no immediate need to accept her first offer."
