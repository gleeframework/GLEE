"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I still get a good return.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to still make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925000? That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This would be a fair deal that keeps us both happy, and it's the highest I can go. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
