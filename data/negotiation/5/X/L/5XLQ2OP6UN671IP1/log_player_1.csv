{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I still get a good return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial to both of us, emphasizing a ""win-win"" situation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've made a successful sale!
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll wait for his counteroffer and see how close he's willing to come to my desired price. If his offer isn't acceptable, I'll either counter or turn to John, who guarantees me my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to still make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I need to push for a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate, as Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer.  
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than $850,000, especially since I have a backup buyer in John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect again, highlighting the ""happy"" outcome for both of us. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price still allows for some wiggle room in case Bob needs to negotiate further. However, it's significantly closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal closer to my target price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close enough, I might accept. If it's too low, I'll either make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $925000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This would be a fair deal that keeps us both happy, and it's the highest I can go. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether and I might have to settle for John's offer, which is lower than my desired price.
* **Good Deal for Both:** While I'd prefer $1,000,000, $900,000 is a good deal for me, and Bob has shown he's willing to pay a significant amount.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** I'll accept Bob's offer, securing a strong deal and ensuring a sale."
