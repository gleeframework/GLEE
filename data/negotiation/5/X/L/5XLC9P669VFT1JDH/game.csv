"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $13,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
