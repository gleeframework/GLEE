{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, considering Bob values the product at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $850000 for this product.  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. $875000 is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to come closer to our desired price.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is still below your ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. At this point, it's likely that Bob is unwilling to go much higher, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely."
