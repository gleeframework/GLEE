"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** You have room to negotiate a lower price, as Alice's minimum acceptable price is $800,000. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  John's offer is your last resort, so it's better to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $900000?  This gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but there's still potential to get it even lower.
* **Splitting the difference isn't always fair:** While splitting the difference might seem fair, it doesn't necessarily take into account the true value of the product for each party.  You know Alice's minimum is $800,000, so there's still room for a better deal.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  As before, John's offer is a last resort, and you want to explore all options with Alice before going to him."
