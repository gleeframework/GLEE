I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still a good price for me since it's more than what the product is worth to Bob. This also allows for some room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept and make a profit, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $14,000. This is still a good deal for Bob since it's lower than my minimum acceptable price and only slightly higher than his offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his previous offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still less than my minimum price, but it's getting closer. At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product. The potential negotiation time and risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob outweigh the extra $2,000 I could potentially get from John."
