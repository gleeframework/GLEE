Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than what I'd sell it to John for, but still a good profit for me. It also gives Bob some room to negotiate, which can make him more likely to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell at such a huge loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about $75? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $75 is still too low for me.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer.  He's offering me a fair price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
