Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob's value is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and make a decision based on his perceived value and the risk of losing him completely.  I'll always keep John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point.  While I'd like to sell, $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise closer to my target.  John's offer remains a safety net, but I'm willing to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum and closer to his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product. I'm hoping this will entice him to come up a bit and we can find a deal. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer.  I'll aim for something in the middle ground to see if we can find a price we both agree on. However, if this fails, I'm going to sell to John.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is too high, and I don't want to end up with an unacceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  It's a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  If he rejects this, I'll sell to John.  I'm hoping this final offer will convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm going to sell to John.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go higher. I don't want to risk continuing to negotiate and potentially lose him completely, leaving me with nothing.  John's offer is guaranteed, and it's above my minimum, so it's the best option for me at this point."
