"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and it will provide a clear indication of her flexibility. If she's not willing to budge much from $1,200,000, then I'll know I need to be more realistic in my subsequent offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement. I believe I can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate. It's still early in the process, and I want to maximize my potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my desired range. By moving in smaller increments, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and we're now within a reasonable range.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm concerned about wasting valuable rounds trying to squeeze out an extra $50,000.  The risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the $1,100,000 offer is a good compromise."
