"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $9,375. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $9,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no more. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9000.0,Bob,6,
