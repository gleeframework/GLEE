"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth that much to you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
