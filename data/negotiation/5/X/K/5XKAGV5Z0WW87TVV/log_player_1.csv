{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

This is just a starting point, and I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for better negotiation:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to potentially offer more.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a more advantageous price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay a bit closer to my asking price. How about $12,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $12,000, which is still above my minimum and closer to my initial offer.
* **Maintaining value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth and incentivize him to come closer to my desired price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message maintains a positive and open tone, signaling that I'm willing to continue negotiating to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I really think this product is a good value, and I'm eager to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still just $500 above my minimum threshold. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that he'll become frustrated or less willing to pay more. 
* **Guaranteed sale with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection.

While it's a bit disappointing not to get a higher price, securing a sale at my minimum value is a good outcome, especially given the potential risks of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
