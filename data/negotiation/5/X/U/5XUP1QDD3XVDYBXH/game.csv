"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100 yet. I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",110.0,Alice,5,
