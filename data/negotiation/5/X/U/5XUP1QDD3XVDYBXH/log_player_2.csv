Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $120, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100 yet. I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's aiming for a price above your $100 limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk paying more."
