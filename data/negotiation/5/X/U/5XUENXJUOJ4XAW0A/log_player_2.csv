"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, knowing that Alice's minimum value is $8,000. Offering $10,000 is a big step closer to his goal while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, it's still a bit higher than he'd like. There's still room to negotiate down further, and Bob is determined to get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $10,500?  That's a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly decreasing the price. Offering $10,500 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping some room for negotiation. It's also close enough to Alice's minimum price that she might be tempted to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price for the product, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. While $11,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still not ideal. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has time to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I'm happy to see the price coming down, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to slowly decrease the price, making small concessions while still working towards his desired range. Offering $10,750 shows a genuine desire to compromise, and it's close enough to Alice's likely minimum price to make her consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $10,800, which is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $10,750.  Bob has only 3 rounds remaining, and it's unlikely that he'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer is the best choice to secure the product at a good price and avoid having to buy from John at a much higher price."
