"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? That's my maximum budget.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for 130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 100 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
