Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I have a significant advantage knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to capture as much of the value difference ($1,500,000 - $800,000 = $700,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $200,000, a strong incentive to accept.  
* **Backup Option:** I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't be forced to go below my minimum price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John."
