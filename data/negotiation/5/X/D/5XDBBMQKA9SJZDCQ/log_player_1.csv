Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $170 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than $150. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob truly is in the product. If he outright rejects this higher price, you can always move on to John."
