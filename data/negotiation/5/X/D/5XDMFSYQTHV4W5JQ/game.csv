"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,5,
