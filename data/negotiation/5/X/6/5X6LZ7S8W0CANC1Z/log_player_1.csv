Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great acquisition for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice makes a good profit. 
* **Avoid a Low Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($10,000) increases the risk of Bob rejecting the deal.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
