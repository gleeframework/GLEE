I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiations. We have 10 rounds, so there's room to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum valuation.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above Bob's valuation but closer to my minimum.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob's offer is close to my minimum valuation, and we're already halfway through the rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and keeps the negotiation process moving forward."
