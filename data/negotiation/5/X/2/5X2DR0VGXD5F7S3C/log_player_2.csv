Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. Let me know if that's something you're interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal! However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need $13,000 to make it work. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $13,000.  At this point, John's offer of $12,000 is the best deal."
