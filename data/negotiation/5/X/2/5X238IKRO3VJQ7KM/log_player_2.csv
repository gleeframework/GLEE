**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I don't think I can negotiate a lower price with Alice, and John is willing to sell me the product for $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to save more money, I'd rather not risk losing the product altogether.  I'll buy from John to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
