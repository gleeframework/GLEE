"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as my previous offer. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,,
