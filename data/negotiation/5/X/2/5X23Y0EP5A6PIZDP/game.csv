"Hello Bob, I am offering you our premium product for $12,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be of great value to you, considering its worth to me is significantly higher than this price. I am confident it will meet your needs and expectations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $5,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $5,000 for the item. To provide some flexibility, I am willing to consider an offer closer to my valuation. How about we aim for a midpoint between my initial asking price and your offer? Would $7,000 be within your budget?",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counter offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $6,000? That would make this a great deal for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway between my original asking price and your latest offer. Therefore, I propose a final price of $6,500 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",6500.0,Alice,5,
