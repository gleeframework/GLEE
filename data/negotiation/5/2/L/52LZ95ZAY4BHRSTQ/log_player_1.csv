"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential compromise while still securing a profit well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, but I'm interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's worth trying to squeeze out a better price.  You have more rounds and still have the option of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, you still have several rounds left and the option to sell to John.  It's worth pushing for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would ensure a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer being very close to your minimum, it's a good idea to accept. You are only $75,000 below your desired price, but there's a risk that you might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's also likely that John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000, might not be available later, so accepting Bob's offer is a safe bet."
