"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its worth to me, but I'm open to discussing it further. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000 to make this deal work. This still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
