Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hinting at its potential benefits for him.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation process. If he rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. If he is unwilling to come close to my minimum price, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below my initial offer of $140. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not to compromise too much.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and avoid setting a low price precedent.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price closer to his offer but still well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning and Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing that this is still a good deal for Bob and highlighting the value of the product.
* **Collaborative Tone:** Using a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move designed to find a compromise.  By demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I aim to create a win-win situation while remaining within my acceptable price range."
