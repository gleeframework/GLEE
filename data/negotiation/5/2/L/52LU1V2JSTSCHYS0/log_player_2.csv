"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $1200000. Considering its worth to both of us, let's aim for a fair deal. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has offered the product at your maximum price point. There's no benefit to negotiating further as you're already getting the product at your desired price. Buying from John would be the same price and doesn't offer any advantage."
