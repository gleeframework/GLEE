"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to potentially get a good price. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'd like to pay. How about $75?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have 8 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob!  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
