"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical step in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'd like to pay. How about $75?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal.  $75 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer Bob!  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $100 price to $85. This is a good price, especially considering there are only 7 rounds left before Bob has to buy from John for $150.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially not getting a deal is higher than the benefit of trying to get a few dollars lower. Accepting the offer at $85 is a good balance of saving money and securing the product."
