"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $700,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $650,000. This is already a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $600,000. I'll offer you the product for $650,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

This seems like a good time to accept. Alice is clearly holding a firm line, and while we could try to haggle further, the potential savings are getting smaller.  It's unlikely we'll get a price much better than $650,000 from Alice."
