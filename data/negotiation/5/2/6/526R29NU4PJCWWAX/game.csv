"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $700,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  While $700,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would that price point be workable for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $650,000. This is already a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $600,000. I'll offer you the product for $650,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
