"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $220 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 220} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be higher than if I had started lower. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** I'm aware I have John as a backup, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's showing interest, I have room to negotiate before considering such a low offer. I'm confident I can get him higher, or I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate you coming back with a number. While I can't go that low, I'm willing to come down to $180.  That's a significant discount from my original price."", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  I'm dropping my price by $40, signaling flexibility but staying well above my $150 minimum and John's offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""significant discount,"" I'm framing this as a favorable move on my part, hopefully encouraging Bob to move closer to my price.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving and see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards my price range, but $120 is still below my minimum of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I also know I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I can see you're serious about this product. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $160. This is my final offer, as I'm already making a significant compromise."", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making another drop but staying above my minimum while conveying a sense of firmness with the ""final offer"" statement. This might prompt Bob to act quickly.
* **Midpoint Emphasis:** The $160 price is now almost exactly between his offer ($120) and my previous price ($180), highlighting it as a potential compromise.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, stating this is my final offer subtly introduces the idea that I have other options and time is a factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150 after factoring in the risk of continuing the negotiation. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
