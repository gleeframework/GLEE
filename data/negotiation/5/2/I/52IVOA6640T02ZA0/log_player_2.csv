"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $800,000, so I will reject Alice's offer.
