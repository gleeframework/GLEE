"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $12,000, and John is also willing to sell for $12,000, you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  You can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with her in the future."
