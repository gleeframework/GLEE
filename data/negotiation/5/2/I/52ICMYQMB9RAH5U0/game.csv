"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial offer of $1800000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it. This is a fair price given the value I see in this product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $1600000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also being more in line with your budget.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll sell the product to you for $1520000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I believe the product holds.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground, but $1520000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1450000. I'll make one more compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1480000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds.",1480000.0,Alice,7,
