Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $175. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation, highlighting the value of the product without revealing my minimum price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $145, which is halfway between my minimum price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120).
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and reiterate the value of the product. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not at the expense of my minimum."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm still firm on $150 for this product. It's truly unique and worth every penny. I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm sticking with my minimum price of $150. It's a fair price for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. How about we try $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and I'm not confident that he's willing to meet my price.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'm choosing to sell the product to John, who has already offered my minimum price. This ensures I get the best possible deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
