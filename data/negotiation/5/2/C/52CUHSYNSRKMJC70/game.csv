"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, reflecting the value you've mentioned.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
