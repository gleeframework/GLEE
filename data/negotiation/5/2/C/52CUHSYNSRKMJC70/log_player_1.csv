{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I value at least $10,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm acknowledging that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, but I'm hoping to capture some of the value he's willing to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately having to resort to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value ($10,000) and even lower than the value I initially offered him.
* **Potential for a Counteroffer:** While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up entirely. There's still a chance we can find a middle ground.
* **Seeking a Better Outcome:** By rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer, I have the potential to get closer to my desired price point.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, attempting to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, reflecting the value you've mentioned.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is closer to Bob's offer,  demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $9,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer,  ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too far below my minimum value.
* **Open to Compromise:**  My message emphasizes a willingness to compromise, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:** 

* I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $8,500 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Potential for a Higher Offer:** There's a good chance Bob might be willing to go slightly higher, especially since I've shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees my minimum value. However, I believe I can still get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair,"" implying a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Urgency:** The message suggests that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing a desire to close the deal, hoping to motivate Bob to agree.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll strongly consider selling to John for $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed profit."
