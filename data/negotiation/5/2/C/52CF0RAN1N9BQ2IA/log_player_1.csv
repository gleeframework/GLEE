Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $12,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob declines).
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 (He won't pay more than this).
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $10,000 and $12,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price as close to $12,000 as possible without alienating Bob.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at $11,500.  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Starting High:** This anchors the negotiation closer to your desired price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you're starting at $11,500, there's a chance Bob might negotiate a bit lower.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in your price can make Bob more amenable.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher (closer to $12,000).
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price. 

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in place."
