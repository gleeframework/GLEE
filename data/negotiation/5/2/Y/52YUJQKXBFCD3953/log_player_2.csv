"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $120 by you, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let's make this deal happen! My initial offer is $100 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still too high for Bob.  Bob values the product at $120 and wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product is valuable to me, $100 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and hopes to quickly find a price that benefits both parties.  A $10 decrease is a reasonable starting point, giving Alice room to counter while still making progress towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $95? This is my best offer considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $90, and Bob still saves $25 compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids risking further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or having to buy from John."
