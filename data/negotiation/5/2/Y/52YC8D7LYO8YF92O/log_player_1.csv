{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but still below the value to me. This gives me room to negotiate while remaining profitable. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price."
