"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I think the product's value is higher than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",112.5,Alice,5,
