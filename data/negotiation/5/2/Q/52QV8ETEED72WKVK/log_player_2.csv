"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking $145 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $145 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $135 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?"", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $134.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $134. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $134
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but she's only willing to come down to $134. This is still above Bob's preferred price point of $120.  Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $120, it makes more sense for him to accept that offer and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
