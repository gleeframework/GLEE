"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $16000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and while I understand you have a budget, $16000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $18000 is still above my limit.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $16000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
