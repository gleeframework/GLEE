# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,250,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000
* **Maximum Budget:** $1,500,000

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount above her own valuation. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $1,000,000 valuation.

**Important:** You have a backup option (John) so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely. This puts you in a stronger negotiating position."
