"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to sell to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $105. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was a bit too high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $102. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
