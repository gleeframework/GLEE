"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price needs to be lower to make sense for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than you'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could meet you halfway between our previous offers.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
