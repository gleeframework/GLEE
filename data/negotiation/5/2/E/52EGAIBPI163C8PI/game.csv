"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This price still represents a good value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
