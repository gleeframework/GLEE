"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500.

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
