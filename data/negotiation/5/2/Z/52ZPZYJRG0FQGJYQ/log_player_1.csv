I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
