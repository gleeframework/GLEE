"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $14,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $12,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget better."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $12000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $13000. That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good deal for you. You can buy the product for $1,000 less than your maximum budget and $1,000 more than Alice's minimum. Accepting the offer allows you to get the product without risking a counteroffer and a potential stalemate."
