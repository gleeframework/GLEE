"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is significantly below what you value the product for and what it's worth to him. You have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,075,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for me. How about $950,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still too low. You can afford to push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's getting closer.  To be fair, though, your initial offer was quite a way off from where I valued the product.  Could we try $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're getting close, but Bob is clearly willing to go higher.  Holding firm for one more round is worth the risk."
