"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for me. How about $950,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's getting closer.  To be fair, though, your initial offer was quite a way off from where I valued the product.  Could we try $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're nearing a deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer reflecting the product's true value.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
