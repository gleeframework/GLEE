"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $17,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to be immediately rejected. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the potential deal for Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation by asking for his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable deal.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 rounds remaining, so I can afford to be patient and wait for a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I still have a chance to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum price, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""make this work"" to encourage a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a significant step closer to your price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob is showing some willingness to increase his offer. I want to see if he'll go higher before I consider selling to John.
* **Time on my side:**  I still have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm not desperate for a sale. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the compromise and fairness of the offer.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and potentially move closer to my desired price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise. It is worth seeing if he will increase his offer further.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to come up, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this and move on to bigger things."", ""product_price"": 14250}

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  We are in round 7, and I want to secure a deal as soon as possible."
