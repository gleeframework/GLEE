Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can lower the price gradually, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable value. 
* **John as a backup:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage. If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still under my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my goal. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I know John is willing to pay $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer just to make a sale.  This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $9,500, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  A friendly message keeps the negotiation open and avoids pushing Bob away.
* **Clear next steps:** I'm stating that this is my final offer, giving Bob a clear decision point. 
* **Remember John:**  If Bob rejects, I can still turn to John and secure a sale for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but I'd like to go even lower to $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, so I'll go $9,000 to $9,150 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but still under:**  While $9,150 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, it's still significantly lower.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** The back-and-forth is starting to get tiring, and Bob's offer indicates he's not willing to budge much more. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is significantly higher than what I would earn with Bob at this point. 

Considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob to be lengthy and possibly fruitless, and the certainty of a higher profit with John, selling to John is the most strategic option at this moment."
