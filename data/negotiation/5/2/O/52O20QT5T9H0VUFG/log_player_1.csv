Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning any price below this gives him a net benefit.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer to Bob should exceed this.
* **Splitting the Difference:** A price of $120 splits the difference between your minimum ($80) and Bob's maximum ($150). This aims for a mutually beneficial deal where both parties profit.

**Important Note:** While this is a reasonable starting point, negotiation tactics can be complex. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, or your initial offer might be accepted outright."
