"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,050,000 for it.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $1,125,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum price point. To make this work, I need to see $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to move forward at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
