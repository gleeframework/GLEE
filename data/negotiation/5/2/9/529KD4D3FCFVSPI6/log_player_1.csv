We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is moving in the right direction. Let's see if we can push a little further."

**Reasoning:**

While we could push for a little more, Bob's offer of $1,555,000 is a strong price and considerably higher than our guaranteed offer from John. It's always possible Bob could walk away, leaving us to accept the lower amount. It's better to secure a great deal now than risk losing it for a potentially marginal gain."
