"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $12,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still  above his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $12,500 is a good price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a risk that if I reject and make a counteroffer, he might walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer."
