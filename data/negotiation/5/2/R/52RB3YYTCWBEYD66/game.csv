"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation, and it leaves room for us both to make a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
