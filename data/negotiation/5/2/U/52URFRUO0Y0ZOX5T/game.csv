"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value is $15000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a significant discount from my true value. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $10250.  Let's split the difference and go with $10375. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident this is the best possible outcome for both of us.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle and make a deal work. What do you think?",10200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10200, but I'm still not satisfied with that price.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $10300.
