Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a bit high at $1000000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can we compromise on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $850000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $875,000, it's important to close the deal before running out of rounds. We're only at Round 6, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  $850,000 is still a good deal for me, and it's worth securing the sale."
