"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $100. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90?  It's a fair compromise and would get us both closer to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $120 to $100, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, which is $95. It's the best I can do.",95.0,Alice,5,
