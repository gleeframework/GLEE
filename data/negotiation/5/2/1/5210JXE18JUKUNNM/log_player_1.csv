"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a strategic move for a few reasons:

* **Sets a high bar:** It establishes my expectations and positions me as a seller who values the product highly.
* **Room for negotiation:** It gives me plenty of room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Tests Bob's interest:** If Bob rejects this offer outright, it suggests he might not be a serious buyer, or he is unwilling to pay what I believe the product is worth. 

In the next round, I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,800,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if I'm not satisfied with the negotiations with Bob.  

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my initial asking price but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer of $2,000,000, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price.  

I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate.  If he accepts this offer, it shows he's serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a significant amount. If he rejects this offer again, I will have to decide if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,750,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe the product is worth more than that. With several rounds left, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

I'm also considering John's offer of $1,500,000 as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob don't go well. 

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,850,000.  This is a more significant compromise than the previous round, but it still leaves me with a comfortable profit.  

I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.  If he accepts this offer, it shows that he's serious about purchasing the product and is willing to pay a fair price. If he rejects this offer again, I will seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000, as we are nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. With six rounds left, I want to continue pushing for a higher price.  

This negotiation has been a bit of a back-and-forth. I'm not sure if Bob is truly committed to the product or if he's simply trying to lowball me.  I'm also not sure if he's aware of my fallback option with John. 

In the next round, I'll counter with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still leaves me with a profit that feels worthwhile. If he rejects that offer again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1775000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm now offering $1,775,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer of $1,725,000. 

With only four rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a higher price.  I'm hoping that this compromise will be enough to entice Bob to finally make a deal. However, I'm also considering John's offer of $1,500,000 as a real possibility.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer in the next round to ensure I don't lose out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob have stalled.  It's clear that he's not willing to meet my price, and I'm running out of time. While $1,700,000 is a decent price, it's still not as good as John's offer of $1,500,000, which is a guaranteed sale.  

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer in the next round, potentially leaving me with no sale at all."
