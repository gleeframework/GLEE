"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the lower end of what the product is worth to her, so there's likely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while also highlighting his commitment to acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  While there might be room for further negotiation, accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
