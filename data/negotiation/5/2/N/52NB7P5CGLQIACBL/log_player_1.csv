Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly opening:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaving space for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hard and fast price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if he's interested but thinks the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still below it. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for me to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $120 as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about $100? That would still be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $100, he's getting a great deal.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or even a stalemate. 
* **John's offer as a backup:** I can still sell to John for $120 if I need to, so accepting Bob's offer is a safe option. 

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at a price close to my minimum, minimizing the risk of losing a sale or having to negotiate further."
