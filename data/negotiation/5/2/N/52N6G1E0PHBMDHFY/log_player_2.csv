"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Aiming for Savings:**  My goal is to save as much as possible, and starting low increases the chances of getting closer to my $10,000 limit.
* **Respectful Tone:** I want to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere even while being firm about my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Limit:** Alice's offer of $10,000 matches the maximum I'm willing to spend.
* **Avoiding John:** While I could buy from John at the same price, accepting Alice's offer saves me the potential hassle of going to a different seller. 
* **Fair Deal:** Alice negotiated reasonably, and this price feels like a fair compromise."
