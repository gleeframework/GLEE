Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it quickly."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it at $13,000 gives Bob a $2,000 discount (making it very appealing), while still earning you a significant profit above your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you subtly encourage Bob to act quickly before the opportunity is gone."
