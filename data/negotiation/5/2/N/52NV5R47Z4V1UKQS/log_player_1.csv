"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me and shows a willingness to negotiate. I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer as it's closer to his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,050,000.  This is getting very close to my minimum, but I believe it's still a reasonable price for both of us.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000. We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and while Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, it's still not enough to reach my desired profit.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John."
