Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as a reflection of the product's value, making it more appealing than a simple, blunt offer.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a high reward."
