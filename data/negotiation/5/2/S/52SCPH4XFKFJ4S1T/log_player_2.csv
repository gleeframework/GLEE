"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity considering its value to you is $12,000. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the opportunity for a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting lower, you signal that you're looking for a good deal and are willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Considering John:** You have a backup option with John at $12,000, so you don't want to agree to a price too close to that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $11,500 for the product. This is still higher than your proposed price, but I hope it aligns better with your budget while allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to your budget, but you're still very close to John's price. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go a little lower, especially since you've already established your willingness to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Movement:**  Instead of making a large jump, this counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a better price.
* **Psychological Target:**  $11,000 feels like a more significant win and might be agreeable to Alice to close the deal.
* **John as Leverage:** You're still below John's price, keeping your backup option viable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product to you and the discussions we've had, I propose a final offer of $11,250 for the product. This allows for a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,250 is a solid price, saving you $750 compared to John's offer and $2,750 off Alice's initial asking price.
* **Finality:** Alice has labeled this as her ""final offer,"" signaling that she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing for the extra $250 might backfire, leading Alice to walk away and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
