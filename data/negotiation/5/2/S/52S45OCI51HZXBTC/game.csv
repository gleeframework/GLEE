"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents the value I see in this product, I understand your budget constraints. Could you consider $17,000?  I'm ready to move quickly if that works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a lower offer. How about $12,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about $14,500?  This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
