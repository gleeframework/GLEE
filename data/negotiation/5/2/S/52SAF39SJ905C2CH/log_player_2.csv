"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive offer considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our mutual interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice wants to sell the product for as much profit as possible. She knows you value it at $1,200,000 but is starting with a high offer.
* **Your Advantage:** You have an alternative seller (John) and know your maximum price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that her price is too high. This opens the door for her to potentially offer a lower price, closer to her $800,000 value. 

**Remember:** Your goal is to get the best possible price, not to settle for the first offer, even if it's within your budget."
