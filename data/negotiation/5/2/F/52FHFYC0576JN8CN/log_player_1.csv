"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, accepting Bob's offer of $1,500,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Meeting my Minimum:** This price matches the amount John is willing to pay, ensuring I don't sell for less than my product's worth to me.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time.  Each round represents a potential delay in closing the deal. Accepting now secures the sale. 
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:**  There's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and pushing too hard could make him walk away."
