,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $1,275,000.  This represents a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings to you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
