This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. By offering $1,400,000, I'm aiming for a profitable deal while also allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than what I'd ideally want. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

$1,250,000 is still below my minimum desired price, but I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?

It seems like we've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm at $1,250,000. While this is less than I'd hoped for, it's still above my minimum desired price and better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
