"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1300000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for the product. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $1200000, but I need you to commit to the purchase. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer, and I expect a serious commitment from you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
