Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing the price,"" signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" you plant the seed in Bob's mind that the product is worth a premium. 

This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and his potential willingness to pay more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price. While his interest is a good sign, accepting $7,000 would mean selling yourself short. You have the backup option of John at $8,000, so there's no need to settle for less. Moving to a counteroffer keeps the negotiation with Bob open while aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Explanation:**  You politely decline Bob's offer, explaining it's too low.
* **Compromise (Apparent):**  Offering to ""meet halfway"" creates a sense of compromise, even though you're still above your minimum. 
* **Strong Counteroffer:** $8,500 is a strong position. It's a significant jump from Bob's offer but still allows room for him to negotiate further if he's really interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking close to his initial offer and seems hesitant to move significantly higher. While he might be persuaded to go a little higher than $7,500, it's unlikely he'll reach your $8,000 minimum.  

At this point, continuing the negotiation has a diminishing return. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the sale with John."
