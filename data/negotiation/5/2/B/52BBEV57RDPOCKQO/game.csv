"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $5,000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could you meet me halfway at $7,500? That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll find this product very valuable.",9000.0,Alice,5,
