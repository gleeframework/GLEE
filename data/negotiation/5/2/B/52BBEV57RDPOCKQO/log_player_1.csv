"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This is a reasonable starting offer. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're serious about a deal while leaving open the option to close with John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $5,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. There's no way I can accept that, so I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could you meet me halfway at $7,500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $15,000 John is offering. I'm going to hold out for a better price from Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll find this product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 9000}
