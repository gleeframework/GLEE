"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a great price, but I have 10 rounds to negotiate. There's a good chance I can get it for even less.  I'll see what Alice's bottom line is before I commit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much wiggle room Alice has.  I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than her initial offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable. I'll adjust my strategy based on Alice's response in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get her down further.  I'm not yet ready to commit to $400,000, as I'm still holding out for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can push her a little further.  By increasing my counteroffer slightly to $350,000, I'm showing her I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to pay her initial asking price. This should keep the negotiation moving forward without risking a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $450,000 is a tempting price, I'm still holding out for a lower price.  I'm committed to getting the best deal possible and I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if I can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, suggesting she's willing to compromise. I'm going to meet her halfway by increasing my offer to $400,000. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. If she accepts, we have a deal. If not, I'll continue to negotiate until I can get a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to negotiate a bit lower, with only three rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer will secure a product at a reasonable price, and I'll still be saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
