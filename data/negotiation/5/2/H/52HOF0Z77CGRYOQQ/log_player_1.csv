Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting you even closer to your $150 goal.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $140 is just below the $150 threshold and seems more appealing than a round number like $150.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a sale without having to go to John."
