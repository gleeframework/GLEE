Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product less than I do, so I need to be open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to meet John's price. This gives Bob a chance to get the product at a price that's still better than what it's worth to him, while also ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. John is offering me my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I start over with another buyer. I'll sell to John to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
