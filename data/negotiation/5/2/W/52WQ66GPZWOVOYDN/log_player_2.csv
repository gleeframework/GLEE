"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $2,000,000. You can get it cheaper from John.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a significantly lower offer of $1,000,000. This gives Alice some room to counter, while still allowing you to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is now at your limit.  It's better to buy from Alice at $1,500,000 than to buy from John at the same price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating further."
