"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the terms of the sale with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still quite high, considering the product's worth to her is only $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds left, so there's ample time to try and get a better deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both parties. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While she's willing to meet halfway, it's still $150,000 more than my initial counteroffer.  I can continue to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my target price.  There are still 7 rounds left to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
