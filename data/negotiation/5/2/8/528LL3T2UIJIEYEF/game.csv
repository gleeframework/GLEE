"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still quite high for me.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This seems like a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both parties. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have a price you're aiming for, but $950,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows you to get a solid profit while I get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
