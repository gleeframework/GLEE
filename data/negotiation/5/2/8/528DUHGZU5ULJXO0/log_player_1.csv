While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Significant Profit:** $825,000 is a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of the product and a strong return overall.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer risks losing Bob entirely. Accepting now secures the deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John offers $1,000,000, there's no guarantee that deal is always available. Accepting a strong offer now is preferable to potentially ending up with nothing."
