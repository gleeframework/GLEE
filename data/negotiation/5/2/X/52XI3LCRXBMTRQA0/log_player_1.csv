Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?**  This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000. It's a good starting point to try and maximize my profit. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a high initial offer. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm trying to push for the highest possible price. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll still make a profit by selling to John."
