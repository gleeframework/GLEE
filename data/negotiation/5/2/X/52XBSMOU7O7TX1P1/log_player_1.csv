Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $1,175,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We're willing to negotiate, but we need to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product, one that will benefit both of us. Considering its potential, how about we settle at $1,250,000?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering the market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our absolute minimum price.  While we could potentially push for more, there's also the risk that he walks away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
