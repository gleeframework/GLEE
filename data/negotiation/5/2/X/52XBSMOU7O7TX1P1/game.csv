"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
