"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,700 is closer to his target price, he can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has not budged much. At this point, Alice's offer of $9,650 is very close to Bob's desired price range and a better deal than buying from John for $10,000. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving some money.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better result, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob missing out on the product increases with each round."
