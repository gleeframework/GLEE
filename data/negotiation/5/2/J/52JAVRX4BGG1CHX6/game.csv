"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our exclusive product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that's worth $1000000 to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save a bit more, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Alice,3,
