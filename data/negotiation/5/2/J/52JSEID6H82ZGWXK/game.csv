"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for it. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's a significant discount, and it still leaves room for you to get a great deal.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. If we can meet in the middle, we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $13,100?  That's a great deal for both of us.",13100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  How about we meet at $13,150?  That's only $50 away from your offer and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal, I'm sure you'll be happy with this product.",13150.0,Alice,7,
