"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's still a significant savings for you and gets me closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,750. How about we try $8,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
