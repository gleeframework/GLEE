"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a little higher than that. How about $115? It's a fair price for a product you value at $150, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $105 is really too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? This is a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $105, but I'm willing to throw in an extra $5 to sweeten the deal. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
