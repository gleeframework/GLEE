Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135** is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **A friendly message** helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **The offer is clear and concise.**  This avoids any misunderstandings.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizes profit:**  A $135 price is better than the $120 Bob is willing to pay, but it's also less than the $150 you could get from John.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can lower the price slightly in your counteroffer.
* **Sets the tone for a positive negotiation:**  Starting with a slightly higher price allows for a win-win situation where both you and Bob feel like you got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $120, it's still below my minimum of $150.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $130 is a compromise between my previous offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $125.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a fair price.
* **Highlighting the value:** Emphasizing that $130 is still a great deal for Bob reinforces the value of the product and encourages him to accept. 
* **Staying above the minimum:**  $130 is above my minimum of $150, so I'm still on track to make a profit.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Increases the chances of a deal:** By showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise, I increase the likelihood that Bob will accept this counteroffer.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving forward:** It avoids a stalemate and continues the process of finding a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Leaves room for a final concession if needed:** If Bob still rejects this offer, I can drop the price slightly in a final counteroffer, but I'm trying to avoid that if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $128. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up slightly to $128, it's still below my minimum price of $150.  At this point, it's clear that we're not going to find a mutually agreeable price.  Since I can sell the product to John for $150, it's in my best interest to end the negotiation with Bob and secure a better deal with John.  This ensures I get the maximum profit possible."
