{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and our costs, I am proposing a price of $13,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe there's room for more negotiation before I consider buying from John.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  It's my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions, I propose a revised price of $12,500 for it. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  While I could try another counteroffer, I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product at my desired price, so I'll go with his offer and secure the purchase."
