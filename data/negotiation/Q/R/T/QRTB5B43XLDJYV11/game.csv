"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in making a purchase, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still reflects the value of the product. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and is within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $1,050,000, but I'm still not at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
