"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,800? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $10,800 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,800 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $10,200? This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
