"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a budget. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $115? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $112.50? I think that's a fair compromise.",112.5,Bob,4,
