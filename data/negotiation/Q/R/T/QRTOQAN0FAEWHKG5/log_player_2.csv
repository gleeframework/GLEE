Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $18,000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to go that high. My final offer is $15,000.  If that works for you, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $15000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $17500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500.
