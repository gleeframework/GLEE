Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price of $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can still likely settle above our $80 minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $80 immediately might make Bob think it's worth even less.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
