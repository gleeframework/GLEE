I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to share with you. I think you'll really appreciate its worth. Would you like to make an offer or discuss the price?,18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for your offer, but $18,000 is higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to offer $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,14000.0
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,13000.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about it. Let me see if I can do a bit better. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250. This seems like a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13250.0,Bob,6,,
