"Bob, I understand your desire to get a great deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit on your offer.  While $1,080,000 is closer to where we need to be, it's still a little too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
