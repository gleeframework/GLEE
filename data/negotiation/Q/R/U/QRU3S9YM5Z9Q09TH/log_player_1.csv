{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount and is a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum.  
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the discount and the opportunity. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to:
    *  Start high enough to maximize potential profit, but not so high that Bob immediately rejects. 
    *  Encourage Bob to counter-offer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. 
    *  I'm always aware of my backup option (selling to John), so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher amount. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll counter-offer Bob and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, potentially $1,150,000 or $1,175,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get a great deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. 
* **Price:** The new price of $1,150,000 is a compromise that reflects my willingness to negotiate but also keeps me above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" and acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, while staying firm on my bottom line.
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counter-offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. If Bob rejects again, I'll consider lowering my price slightly or ending the negotiation and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the amount we've already discussed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,080,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident that I can secure a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher amount.
* **Next Steps:**  I'll counter-offer Bob again, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  I'll likely offer a price slightly lower than my previous counter-offer, perhaps $1,125,000 or $1,130,000.  I'll continue to frame my offers as fair and reasonable compromises while keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit on your offer.  While $1,080,000 is closer to where we need to be, it's still a little too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,125,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** I'm continuing to frame the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while also emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping that this counter-offer will be more appealing to Bob and that we can finally reach an agreement. However, I'm also aware that if Bob rejects this offer, I might have to consider selling to John, as continuing to lower my price may not be worth it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the amount we've already discussed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Bob's latest offer of $1,070,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's clear that we're too far apart in our desired prices, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in further concessions that would ultimately leave me dissatisfied.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate with Bob, and it's becoming increasingly clear that reaching a mutually acceptable agreement is unlikely.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for a much higher price, ensuring I get my desired value and minimizing any further negotiation risks. 
* **Final Decision:** Selling to John is the best option for me. It guarantees the maximum profit and avoids the potential for further frustration and wasted time in negotiations with Bob."
