Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a great deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.
