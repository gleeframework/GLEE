"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth, while also being more in line with your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price point. If you're able to come down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. ",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
