"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $600,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth, while also being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price point. If you're able to come down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. "", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so it's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
