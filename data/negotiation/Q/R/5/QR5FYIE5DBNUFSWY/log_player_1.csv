"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I hope this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my price while still leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I hoped, it's a good deal and I'm concerned about running out of rounds. I'm also not sure how much more I can push Bob for a higher price, and there's always the risk that he'll walk away altogether.  $1,250,000 is a decent profit and I'm comfortable closing the deal."
