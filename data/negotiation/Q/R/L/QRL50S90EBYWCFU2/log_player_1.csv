Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.

I'd rather work with you, but I need a better deal.
