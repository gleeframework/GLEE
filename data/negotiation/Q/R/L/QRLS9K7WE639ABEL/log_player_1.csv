Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  Offering $15,000 is above my minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Attractive but not too low:** This price is potentially attractive to Bob, but not so low that it devalues the product in his eyes.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to negotiate if he's interested. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing me to sell to John for the minimum."
