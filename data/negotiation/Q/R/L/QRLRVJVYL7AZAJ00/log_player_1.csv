Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why my price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the phrase ""given its value"" suggests there might be additional benefits or reasons for the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below that price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still providing Bob a chance to purchase the product."
