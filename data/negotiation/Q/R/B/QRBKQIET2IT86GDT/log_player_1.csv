Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to bring the price down.
* **Understanding Value:**  Both you and Bob value the product at $1,500,000. By offering it at a significant markup, you're testing Bob's eagerness and potentially his perception of the product's value beyond the base amount.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer provides a buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob.  

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
