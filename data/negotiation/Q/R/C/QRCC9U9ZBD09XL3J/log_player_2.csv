{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and while Alice has continued to negotiate, her price is still higher than what I believe is a fair value. I've made significant concessions, and I don't think there's much more room for negotiation in this short timeframe.  Given that John is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum, I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from him. It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Alice and potentially lose out on the opportunity."
