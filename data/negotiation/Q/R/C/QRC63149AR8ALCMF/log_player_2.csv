"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$75 is a good price, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets a lower starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but it's still not low enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I still have a significant number of rounds left to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still staying below Alice's latest offer. This approach demonstrates that I'm engaged in the negotiation, but I'm also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $68 is now very close to my counteroffer of $65.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, so accepting the offer makes the most sense."
