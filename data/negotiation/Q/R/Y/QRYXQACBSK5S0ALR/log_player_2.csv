"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject the offer. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $108? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is offering $108, which is within your budget of $120 and is a better price than John's offer of $120.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
