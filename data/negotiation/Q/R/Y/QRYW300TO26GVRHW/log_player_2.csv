"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than $100, you're still paying more than your maximum budget of $80.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're offering the maximum you're willing to pay. You know Alice values the product at $100, so it's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above your maximum budget. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
