Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more like $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $950,000, I can likely get closer to my desired price with some negotiation.  I'm also not completely opposed to selling to John for $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,025,000 is closer to my goal, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm also not completely opposed to selling to John for $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,025,000.  However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,030,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,030,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm also aware that time is running out, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option if I can't get a better deal with Bob. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,035,000. This is a significant concession, and it's my final offer.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're running out of time, Alice, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,030,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing quickly enough.  The risk of not closing a deal with anyone is too high at this point.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 will give me the best outcome given the current circumstances."
