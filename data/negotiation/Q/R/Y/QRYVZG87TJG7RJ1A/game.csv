"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more like $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,030,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
