"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than what others are charging. For you, we're offering it at an introductory price of $120. This is a great opportunity to get a top-notch product at a reasonable cost. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's closer to her own valuation than mine. I should try to negotiate it down closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to accommodate you as much as possible. Considering your feedback, I am willing to negotiate further. For this exceptional product, I propose an offer of $75. This still allows us to maintain a fair value for our product while making it more accessible to you. Please let me know if this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal. It's below my maximum budget and significantly lower than her initial asking price. It's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Alice, and buying from John would mean missing out on this price."
