{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to leave some room for negotiation.  However, I'm not going to go too high since I know John is willing to pay $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth more than that to me, and I know John will pay significantly more.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer but $60 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120.  It's a great deal for you, and it's closer to my price point.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit much for me. Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's barely over his own valuation of the product. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
