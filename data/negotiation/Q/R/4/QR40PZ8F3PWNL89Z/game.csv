"Bob, thanks for the offer but $60 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120.  It's a great deal for you, and it's closer to my price point.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit much for me. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
