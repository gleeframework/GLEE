"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's worth that much to you, and it's a valuable asset.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation or saving money if you accept her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens up the possibility of a better deal, even if it means ultimately buying from John."
