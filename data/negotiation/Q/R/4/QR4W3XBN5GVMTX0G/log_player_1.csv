Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105? I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $102.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $102.50.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and it's likely we won't get closer.  I want to avoid losing the sale to John and risk getting nothing."
