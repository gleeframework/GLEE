"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's maximum value of $12,000, making it a potentially attractive offer for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for profit.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of ending up with nothing or prolonging the process unnecessarily. John is offering me a guaranteed $10,000, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
