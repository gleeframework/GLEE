"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is outside my budget. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still above what I can comfortably pay. Given the value of the product to me, I can offer $9,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $9,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
