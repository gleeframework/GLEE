"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to consider a price of $950000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $925000. I'm willing to consider a price of $975000. This is a fair price that's still a bit above your previous offer, but I believe it's a good balance between what I need to get out of the sale and what you're willing to pay.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer and meet you at $950000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
