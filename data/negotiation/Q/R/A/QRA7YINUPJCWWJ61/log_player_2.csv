"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, accepting the offer is the best choice. You don't need to go through the hassle of buying from John for the same price."
