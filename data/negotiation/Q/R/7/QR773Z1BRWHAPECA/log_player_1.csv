Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and hints at wider availability (""list it publicly"") to encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
