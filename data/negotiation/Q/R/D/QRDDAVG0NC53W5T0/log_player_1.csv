Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counter-offer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** A strong opening offer demonstrates that you're not just playing games.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price slightly.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using language to suggest finality, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12,000 is still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. It's important to remember that continued negotiation can risk losing the deal entirely, and $11,500 is a solid outcome."
