Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,200. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has stated this is her final offer. While I could push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and there's a risk Alice will walk away from the deal. Accepting $12,200 saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer."
