"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this, and I'm offering $8,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value we're both seeing in this product. ",8250.0,Bob,4,
