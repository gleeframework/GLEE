"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to sell the product for $14000, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll make one last offer: $14500, and that's non-negotiable. If you're still interested, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",14500.0,Alice,9,
