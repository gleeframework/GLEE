"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price considering its value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still aiming for $100.  I understand it's worth more to you, but that's my budget. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly signaling that $100 is his absolute limit.  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of him going with John."
