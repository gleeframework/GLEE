"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking $120 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. While this is a good price, I can likely get it for less by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it. $120 is a bit high for me right now.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference at $110?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$110 is a good price considering my $150 limit. I'm getting a good deal, and Alice is getting a better price than her initial offer.  It's a win-win!"
