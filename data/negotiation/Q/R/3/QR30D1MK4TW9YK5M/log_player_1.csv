Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $120 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive. This is likely to make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Openness:** I'm not being overly aggressive. I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, which signals a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll evaluate his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it. $120 is a bit high for me right now.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer of $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price range. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and I want to capitalize on that.
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to see how committed he is to buying the product and potentially pushes him to increase his offer.

**Next steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, likely starting somewhere between $100 and my initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference at $110?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This shows good faith and makes him more likely to accept.
* **Still above minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""walk away happy"" creates a positive tone and reinforces the value of the product.

**Next steps:**

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* **Reject:** If he rejects, I'll need to assess his commitment to the deal and whether I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
