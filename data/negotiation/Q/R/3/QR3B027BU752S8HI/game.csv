"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $990,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,005,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",1005000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,005,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",980000.0,Bob,6,
