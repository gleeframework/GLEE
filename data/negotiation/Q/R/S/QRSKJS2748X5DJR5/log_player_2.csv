"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $130 is less than the $150 John is asking, there's still room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering $100, which is still more than the product is worth to Alice. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation, giving Alice room to counter while still allowing Bob to save a considerable amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $130 represents a fair price given the product's value, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better.  He's willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a smaller, more incremental counteroffer.  He's showing that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still trying to get the best possible price.  By offering $110, Bob is  showing a willingness to compromise while keeping a buffer for further negotiation."
