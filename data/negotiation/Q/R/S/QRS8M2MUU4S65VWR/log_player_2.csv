"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. It holds significant value for you, worth $1,200,000. I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer. In light of our discussion, I propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This allows for a compromise between our positions while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might yield an even lower price, it's unlikely that Bob will be able to secure a price point lower than $1,050,000 within the remaining rounds."
