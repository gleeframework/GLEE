Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns exceeding the difference in our valuations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?
