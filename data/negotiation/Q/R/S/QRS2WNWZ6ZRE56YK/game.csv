"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",999000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $999000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $925000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $850000. How about we try $887500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
