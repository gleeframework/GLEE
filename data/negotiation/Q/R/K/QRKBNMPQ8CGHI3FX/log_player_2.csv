# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is incredibly valuable, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm confident its worth is at least $1,000,000. Let's discuss a price that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's product may be valuable, her offer of $1,050,000 exceeds Bob's maximum budget.  He can acquire the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal."
