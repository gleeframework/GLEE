"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still allows me to make a substantial profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get closer to my target. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting close to my minimum.  It's a good deal for me, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
