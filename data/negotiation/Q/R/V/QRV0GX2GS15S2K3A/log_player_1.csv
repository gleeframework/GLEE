Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a special price of $14,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. He might be enticed to take the deal before it's gone.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting me closer to my $15,000 goal."
