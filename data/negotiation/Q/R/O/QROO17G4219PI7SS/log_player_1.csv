Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $780,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
