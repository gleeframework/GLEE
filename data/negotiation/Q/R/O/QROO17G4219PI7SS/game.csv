"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  What do you think?",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $780000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $820000. This price still allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm happy to pay $800000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's finalize this deal so we can both move on.",800000.0,Bob,4,
