"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10500.  That's a fair price, given that I could get it from John for $10000.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10500, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11250. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
