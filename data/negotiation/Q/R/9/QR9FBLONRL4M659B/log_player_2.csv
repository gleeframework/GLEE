"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's something you'll find valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $14,000 is still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13250? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your $12,000 limit.  While you could counteroffer again, it's likely you'll end up paying more than you want. You can get the product for your target price from John."
