"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. I would like to counteroffer at $1,200,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still leave you with a substantial profit and would be a fair price for me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
