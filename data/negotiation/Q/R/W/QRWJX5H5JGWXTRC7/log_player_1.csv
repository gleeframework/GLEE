{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting $400,000 more than your minimum, which is a good start.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob can still make a profit, which makes him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for both of you to negotiate and potentially come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. I would like to counteroffer at $1,200,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is still a significant profit for me, it's a far cry from the potential $1,400,000 I was aiming for. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still leave you with a substantial profit and would be a fair price for me. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
