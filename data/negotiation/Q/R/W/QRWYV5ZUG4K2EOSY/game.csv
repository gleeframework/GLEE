"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and would be happy to discuss further.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and would be happy to discuss further.",825000.0,Alice,5,
