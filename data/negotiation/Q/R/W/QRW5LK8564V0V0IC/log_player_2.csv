"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately.  You're looking to save money, and rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price from Alice.  Buying from John right away would be pointless since you can get the same product from Alice at the same price.  The counteroffer strategy gives you more leverage to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant price cut.  It's a bold move that shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal.  It also leaves plenty of room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still within the range where you could potentially negotiate a better deal.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 would be pointless since you're trying to save money.  Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer increases your offer from the previous round, showing you're serious about buying, but also keeps the price well below her offer. This creates a middle ground for potential agreement and keeps the pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, it's still too high. There are still rounds left, and rejecting and counteroffering allows you to potentially secure a better deal. Buying from John right now would mean paying $1,000,000, so continuing the negotiation is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to come down on her price. This counteroffer shows that you're prepared to meet her halfway while still trying to save money. This move keeps the negotiations moving forward towards a potential agreement."
