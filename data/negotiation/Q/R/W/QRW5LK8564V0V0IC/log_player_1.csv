"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate from there. 

However, I'm also aware that this might be too high, so I'm prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and the progression of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still far too low for me to accept. I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's offer is simply not a viable option at this point. I believe there is still room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  However, it's still a price that reflects the value I place on the product while leaving room for further negotiation.  I believe this offer shows good faith and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept. I believe there's potential to push for a higher price, especially since I'm not under immediate pressure to sell.  I'm confident that with more negotiation, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's also a price that's very close to my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to close the deal, especially since John is waiting in the wings with an offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000.  While Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer, I'm running out of time and the risk of further negotiation is too high. It's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or not closing the deal at all."
