"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is much higher. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the closest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
