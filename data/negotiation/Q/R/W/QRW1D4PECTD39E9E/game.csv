"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Could we start the negotiations at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so my counteroffer is $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
