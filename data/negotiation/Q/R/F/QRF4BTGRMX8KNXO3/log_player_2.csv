"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a good price, you can potentially get it for even cheaper by making a counteroffer. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you still have room to negotiate. It's worth trying another counteroffer before potentially settling for $9,200."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still not quite within your target range. You've been making counteroffers, and she's been rejecting them. It's possible that she's unwilling to go lower, and you've likely reached the limit of your negotiation efforts.  It's more efficient at this point to buy from John for $10,000 to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
