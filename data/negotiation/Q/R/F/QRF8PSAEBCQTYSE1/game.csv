"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15000 is my absolute maximum. Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm very interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12000 is a good offer, it's a little lower than I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to go up to $13000? This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth it for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, and so do I. $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference at $12500? It's a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying your product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
