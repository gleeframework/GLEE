"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer attempts to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired price range. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message remains courteous and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, which is a good sign. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** $12,000 is still above your budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle on a price of $8,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** You're now stating your maximum price clearly.
* **Justification:**  By framing it as a ""fair deal,"" you're emphasizing that this price is your limit and benefits both parties. 
* **Time Constraint:**  You're getting closer to your fallback option with John, so putting your best offer forward makes sense."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,000 is the absolute minimum you're willing to pay, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $14,000. It's still a discount from my initial offer, but it's a more reasonable price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has indicated that $14,000 is her bottom line.  It seems unlikely she will budge significantly from this price.
* **No More Room:**  You've clearly stated your maximum price of $8,000, and Alice is unwilling to meet it.
* **Guaranteed Price:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which aligns perfectly with your budget and saves you a significant amount compared to Alice's offer.

Continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point is unlikely to result in a better outcome.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the price you've deemed acceptable."
