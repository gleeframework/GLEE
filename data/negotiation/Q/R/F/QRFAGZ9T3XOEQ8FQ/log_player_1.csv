Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still allowing me to make a good profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting the Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a good deal for Bob compared to what he might get elsewhere. 
* **Maintaining Optionality:** By mentioning ""what I could get elsewhere,"" I subtly remind Bob that I have other options (John) and am not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my minimum, selling for $1,300,000 would still result in a significant loss for me.
* **I have a better alternative.** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much more appealing option. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the upper hand and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate further, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to go down to $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not closing the door completely. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but not desperate.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm offering a smaller price reduction to signal flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Framing it Positively:**  I highlight this as a ""significant compromise"" on my part, putting the onus on Bob to reciprocate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate that the price reflects the value of the product, adding weight to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this price is closer to a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,350,000 I offered in the previous round.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a lengthy back-and-forth.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures a larger profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

The risk of getting a lower price or a longer negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential benefits of a slightly higher price. Selling to John is the most rational and profitable decision at this point."
