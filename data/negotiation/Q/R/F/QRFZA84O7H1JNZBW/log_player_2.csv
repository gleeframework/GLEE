"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $1250000.  This is a significant discount and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product, which is $1,000,000.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower the price to something closer to her own valuation, potentially resulting in a significant saving for me."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1050000 is closer to my desired range, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000, which reflects the value you see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for me. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your final decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than her valuation but represents a significant improvement from her initial offer.  It's also considerably lower than the $1,500,000 I would pay John. Accepting this offer means I save $350,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially beneficial choice in this scenario."
