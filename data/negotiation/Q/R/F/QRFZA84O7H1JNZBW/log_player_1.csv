I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which reflects the value you see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for me. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
