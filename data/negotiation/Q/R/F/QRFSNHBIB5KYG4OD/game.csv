"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $10,250. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,250 is still below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",11500.0,Alice,5,
