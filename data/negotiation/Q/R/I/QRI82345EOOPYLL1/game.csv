"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  However, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $17000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to go down to $16000.  This is a fair price that takes into account both of our positions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $16000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $15500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",15500.0,Bob,6,
