{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer represents a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, making it attractive for Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This offer is likely to spark his interest, as it's lower than his estimated value of $800,000.
* **Start a negotiation:**  It gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, allowing for a back-and-forth process.
* **Maintain leverage:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving me room to accept a counteroffer or move to John if Bob's offer is unsatisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I will counter-offer Bob to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,000,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This counteroffer represents a further compromise from my previous offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob a strong incentive to accept, as it's closer to his desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs.  It's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 and guarantee a satisfactory profit."
