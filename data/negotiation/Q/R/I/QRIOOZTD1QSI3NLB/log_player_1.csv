""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below that is pointless. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing John will buy it for $1,200,000 gives Alice bargaining power.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below John's price ($1,100,000) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob, while still maximizing Alice's profit."
