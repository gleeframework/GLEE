Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You know you have John as a backup who will pay your minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you could still settle on a price higher than $12,000. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you want to make as much as possible, starting too high (e.g., close to $20,000) could make Bob immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate."
