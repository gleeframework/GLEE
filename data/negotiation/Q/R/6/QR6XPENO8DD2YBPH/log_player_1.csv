Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a significant amount for me and allows you to make a healthy profit. I believe this offer is fair to both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
