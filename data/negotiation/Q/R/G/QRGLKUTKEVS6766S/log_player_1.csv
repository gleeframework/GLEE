Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Offering it at $140 is a price that's still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat good deal.
* **Psychology:** By starting with a higher price, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making it more likely he'll accept a slightly lower price if he counter-offers.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, reject it outright, or try to negotiate further.  You'll need to be prepared to respond accordingly."
