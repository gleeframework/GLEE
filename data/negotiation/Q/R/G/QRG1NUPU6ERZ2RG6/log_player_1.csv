Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is far too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a bit higher than my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping he'll meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is still too low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a compromise from my last offer and is still above my minimum. I hope Bob will see that I'm serious about selling to him and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$140 is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145} 
```

I'm going to counter with $145. This is just a little above Bob's last offer, and it's very close to my minimum. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum value. I'm not willing to go any lower. I've given Bob a fair chance, but he's not willing to meet my price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
