"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential and worth, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,800,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than my minimum acceptable price and even further from my initial offer.  Bob's counter-offer indicates a willingness to negotiate, so I'll try to meet him closer to the middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still quite a bit below my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  I believe this price reflects the true value of this product and leaves us both with a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By reducing the price by $100,000, I am demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I am still keeping the price point significantly above Bob's offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am unable to meet you at $1,900,000. I would like to propose $1,750,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this will be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to the $1.8 million mark, but I'm still above my guaranteed sale price with John. It's a calculated risk, but I'll apply a bit more pressure to see if I can nudge Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  Let's make this simple: $1,850,000, and we have a deal. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a compromise, but I need you to meet me halfway."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm at a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's offer while presenting it as my final concession.  The ""take it or leave it"" tone adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet you at $1,850,000. I would like to propose $1,800,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this will be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has met my previous ""final offer"" price of $1,800,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above my guaranteed sale price with John and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
