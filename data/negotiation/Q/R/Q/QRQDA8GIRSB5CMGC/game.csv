"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer it to you for $550000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800000.
