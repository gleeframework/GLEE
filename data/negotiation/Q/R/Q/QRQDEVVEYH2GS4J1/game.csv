,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $22,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This is a fair offer considering its potential.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
