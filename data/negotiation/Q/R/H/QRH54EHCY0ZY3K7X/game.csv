"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a bit above your initial estimate, but I believe the value it brings to you justifies the price. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This is a substantial discount from my initial price, and I believe it still offers you excellent value.  Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the discount, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers. It's also closer to your offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm going to be upfront â€“  $1,350,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum, and it's a price that still offers you significant value. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for this product.  Let's close the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you can meet me halfway. Can you reconsider?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
