"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. While I'm interested, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you compared to John's price, and it's a price that I feel comfortable with.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
