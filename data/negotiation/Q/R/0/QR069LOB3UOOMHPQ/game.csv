"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $14000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $10500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $11250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
