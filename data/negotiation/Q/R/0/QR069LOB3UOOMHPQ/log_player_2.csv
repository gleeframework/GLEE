"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this unique item, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $14,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying to push for a lower price. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $11250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, and we're only in round 5.  While she seems firm on her price, it's risky to continue negotiating with her.  I don't want to spend too many rounds trying to reach a price that works for me, especially since there's a guaranteed alternative with John.  Buying from John will ensure I get the product within my budget."
