**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the same as John's, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to come down in price to secure a sale."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still think the product's value is worth more than $1,125,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,140,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,140,000, which is only $40,000 more than my last offer.  While I'd like to save even more, it's getting close to John's price.  It's a good deal, and it's time to close the deal."
