"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $10,000, a counteroffer of $10,500 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is lower than John's price of $12,000.  This is a good deal for you as you are saving $500 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal to John makes it worthwhile to accept Alice's offer."
