"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is more than selling to John, it's still significantly below my minimum of $100.  I'm willing to continue negotiations to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $105 is the best price. I can do $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm hoping to get a bit more by continuing negotiations. It's worth taking the risk of losing the deal with Bob, since I can still sell to John for a better price than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can't go as low as $95, but how about we settle on $100?  That way, we both get a fair price and I can avoid selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I can meet you at $98, that's my final offer. Can you accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $98 is tempting, it's still slightly below my minimum price. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $100. If I reject this offer, I can either sell to John for $100 or see if Bob is willing to come up to my price. The risk is that Bob might walk away, but I think it's worth the gamble."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $98 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  If you're willing to go up to $100, I'd be happy to seal the deal with you.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $100, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we do $99? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Bob isn't going to budge much further.  While $99 is close to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to feel comfortable with the deal.  I'm better off selling to John for $100 and avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  It's better to guarantee a profit and move on."
