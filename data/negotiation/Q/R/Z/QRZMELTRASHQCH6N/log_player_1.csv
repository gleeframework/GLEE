This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and whether he's willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'm happy to sell the product to Bob for $10,000, I'm going to try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Bob is now offering less than what John is willing to pay. While I'd prefer to get a bit more,  it's best to secure a sale at this point and avoid further negotiation.  Selling to John for $10,000 is the safest option and ensures I get a decent price."
