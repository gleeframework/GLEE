Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to be persuasive without seeming outlandish. Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price.

By offering it slightly below our guaranteed sale price to John, we create a strong incentive for Bob to accept while still securing a significant profit."
