Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't reflect the value of the product. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  If Bob is truly interested, he should be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While it's closer than before, I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirements."
