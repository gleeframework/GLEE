"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
