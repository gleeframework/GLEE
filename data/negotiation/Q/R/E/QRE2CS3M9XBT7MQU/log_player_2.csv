"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's target of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired $12,000 limit.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
