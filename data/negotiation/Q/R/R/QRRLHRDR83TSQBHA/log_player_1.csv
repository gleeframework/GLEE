Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely you'll secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his level of interest. If he immediately rejects the offer, we know we need to come down considerably. If he counters, it suggests he's seriously interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Safety Net:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
