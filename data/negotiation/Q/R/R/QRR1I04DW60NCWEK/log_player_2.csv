"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is attractive ($900,000 is significantly lower than your $1,200,000 maximum), there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price point.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving the price up again is present. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price, saving you a significant amount compared to buying from John."
