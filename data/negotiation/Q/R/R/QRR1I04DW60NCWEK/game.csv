"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
