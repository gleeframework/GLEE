"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, though. How about $1050000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. $950000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
