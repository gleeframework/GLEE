"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its potential and value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective but I'm still firm on the value of this product.  $700000 doesn't reflect its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This allows for a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about other options, so I'd like to hear if you can meet me at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still below my minimum value. However, I'm willing to come down to $825000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can make a deal at this price.",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800000? This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",800000.0,Alice,7,
