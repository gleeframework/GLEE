"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's a chance Alice will accept a lower price, as the product is worth $10,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $10,500, considering the value to you and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,200 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with no other option than to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without taking unnecessary risks."
