"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This still offers you a significant value and leaves room for further negotiation. Let's make this deal happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
