"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. It gives you a good deal while ensuring I can still profit from the sale. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1050000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  I'm serious about buying this product, let's find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
