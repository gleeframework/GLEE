"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a significant investment for you, but I believe the value it offers will be well worth it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. It gives you a good deal while ensuring I can still profit from the sale. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay from John. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try for a lower price."
