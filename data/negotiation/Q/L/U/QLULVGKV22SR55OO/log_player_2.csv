Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $1,130,000. This is my final offer for this round, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While it's not my absolute ideal price, accepting this offer saves $70,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, and it's important to secure the product before potentially losing it."
