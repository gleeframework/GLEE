"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,650,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,350,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's significant value and my desire to find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,450,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
