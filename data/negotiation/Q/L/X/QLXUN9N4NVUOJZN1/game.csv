"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is impressive,  $750,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $700,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,
