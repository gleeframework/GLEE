"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still within a reasonable range for Bob considering his valuation.  This allows room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit.  I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I'm eager to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm eager to make a deal,  $6,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $8,000. I will counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $6,750? It seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm committed to getting as close to my minimum value of $8,000 as possible. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $6,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $7,000. It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,875?  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not willing to go lower than $7,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7250}
