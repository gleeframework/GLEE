"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value and would be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to him, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. There's no reason to accept this offer without trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to find a good home for the product, $8,500 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to Bob's target price."
