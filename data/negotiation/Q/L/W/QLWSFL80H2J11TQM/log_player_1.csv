Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I've done some research, and I believe it's a bit overpriced at $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget of $150. Can we meet at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to be within my budget. How about we try $115? I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers very slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than $120 within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer at $115 is less ideal than John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
