"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I've done some research, and I believe it's a bit overpriced at $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget of $150. Can we meet at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to be within my budget. How about we try $115? I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",115.0,Bob,4,,
