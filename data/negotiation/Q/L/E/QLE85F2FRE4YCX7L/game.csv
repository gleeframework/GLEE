"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $700,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant investment for me. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  While I recognize the value of the product, $825,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $775,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This would be a mutually beneficial deal, allowing me to invest in the product and you to close a sale.  Let's find a way to bridge this small gap.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not ready to accept $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.
