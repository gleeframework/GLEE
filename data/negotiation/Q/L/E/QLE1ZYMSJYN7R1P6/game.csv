"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introduction to the product. However, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While the product is impressive, $1,100,000 still stretches my budget a bit. How about $925,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $925,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000 as a final attempt.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This product is a game-changer, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
