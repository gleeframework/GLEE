Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a great price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers.  
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly is ideal even if I make slightly less profit than selling to John. This offer balances a quick sale with a good profit margin."
