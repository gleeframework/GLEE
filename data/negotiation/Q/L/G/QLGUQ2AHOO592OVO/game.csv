"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $9,500? I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value this product provides.",9500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only if we can agree on $9,400. This price is closer to my minimum and reflects the true value of this product. Let me know your thoughts.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,300? This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. I'm confident you'll find this product valuable at this price.",9300.0,Alice,7,
