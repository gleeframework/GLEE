"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see from it."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** We're aiming to maximize profit, so our opening offer should be significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and our own minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves ample room for negotiation over the next 10 rounds. 

By starting high, we:

1. Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
2. Potentially secure a deal closer to our desired price. 
3. Establish ourselves as confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still below our desired profit margin. We have room to negotiate and try to bring the price closer to our starting point.  We're not in a desperate situation to accept his offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of its potential for significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a substantial concession from our initial price ($2,200,000 to $2,000,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):** We're still holding above Bob's offer by a significant amount. This signals that we value the product highly but are open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value and potential for returns to justify the price. 

The goal is to keep the negotiation moving while aiming for a higher closing price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the product's potential value, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point, but we are still in a position to negotiate further. Accepting $1,900,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table. We are willing to counter in hopes of bridging the gap closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  How about we make this the final push - $1,950,000, and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it a ""final push"" we introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  This offer is a very slight concession from our previous counteroffer, signaling we're reaching the limit of our flexibility. 
* **Clean & Simple:** This offer aims for a clear resolution. Bob is likely to understand that this is close to the best deal he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. While we could push further, the risk of Bob walking away increases.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit margin, well above both our minimum and Bob's initial valuation.
* **Avoid Risk:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation or relying on John. 

It's a good business decision to accept a strong offer on the table rather than risk losing the deal for a potentially marginal gain."
