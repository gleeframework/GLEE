"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a profitable sale. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This price allows us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1320000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go. Let me know what you think.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
