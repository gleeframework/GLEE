"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
