"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $12,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer. You've already brought the price down from $12,000 to $11,000, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  While you could try to get a lower price, you'd need to be prepared to walk away from the deal if Alice refuses.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk losing it and having to buy from John for a much higher price."
