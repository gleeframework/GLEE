{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a friendly tone, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is above my minimum value, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
