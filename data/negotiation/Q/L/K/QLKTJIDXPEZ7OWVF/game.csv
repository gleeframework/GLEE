"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $800,000 to you. Considering our negotiations, I'm willing to offer you a deal that I think is fair for both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering its value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
