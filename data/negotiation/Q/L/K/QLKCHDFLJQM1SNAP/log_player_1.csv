Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start with an ambitious offer.
* **Justification:**  The message includes a touch of justification for the high price, emphasizing the ""value and potential"". This might make Bob more receptive than a bare number.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,200,000, there's space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still significantly higher than our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice (you) might need to adjust your approach in further communication."
