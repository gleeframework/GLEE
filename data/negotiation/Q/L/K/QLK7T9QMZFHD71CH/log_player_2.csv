"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make me a serious offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening offer of $10,000 is higher than John's price of $12,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. Alice is likely motivated to sell to avoid losing the sale altogether. 
* You have some bargaining power because you have a backup option (buying from John)."
