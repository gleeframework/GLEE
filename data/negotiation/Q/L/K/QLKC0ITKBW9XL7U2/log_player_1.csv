Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the value, Alice provides a subtle reason for the higher price without revealing her true minimum.
* **Alternative:** Highlighting that John is waiting as a backup could pressure Bob, but it might also make him feel manipulated and less willing to negotiate.  

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
