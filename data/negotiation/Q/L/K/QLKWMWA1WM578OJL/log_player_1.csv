{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate, but it's not so high that he's immediately turned off.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $150, which is important.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your desired minimum of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You're already pretty close to your goal, and it's worth trying to see if you can push Bob a little further.  Let's see if you can get that last $10."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum while still giving you a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $105 is not terrible, it's just a few dollars above Bob's perceived value. You've already spent a few rounds trying to get a better price, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge significantly.  At this point, it's more valuable to sell to John for $150 and guarantee your minimum desired profit."
