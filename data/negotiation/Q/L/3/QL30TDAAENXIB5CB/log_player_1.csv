Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this offer saves you a significant amount compared to my asking price from other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer it at $15,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower offer, increasing our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below John's offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value and Scarcity:** The message emphasizes the discount and the existence of other buyers to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving us with the option of selling to John at our minimum acceptable price."
