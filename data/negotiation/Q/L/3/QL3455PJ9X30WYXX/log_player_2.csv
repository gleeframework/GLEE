"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $11,000.  To maximize savings, it's better to secure the product from John at $10,000."
