"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is my absolute limit.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a good way to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
