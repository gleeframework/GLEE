Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, so I'm offering it to you for $775,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

Alice has made it clear that $800,000 is her absolute lowest price. Continuing to negotiate would likely be fruitless and might push Alice away from the deal entirely. Accepting the $775,000 offer secures a significant savings compared to John's price."
