"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Starting with a low counteroffer of $9,000 will force Alice to consider a substantial price drop.  This strategy sets the negotiation tone and increases the chances of finding a mutually acceptable price.  While it's possible Alice will reject this offer, it's a good starting point to gauge her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reduced her price slightly, but it's still not ideal for Bob. Since he has 7 more rounds, he should continue to negotiate.  The goal is to get as close to his $10,000 limit as possible without risking losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. $10,500 is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's a good strategy to demonstrate that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he won't overpay. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but the price is still a bit higher than Bob's desired target.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has 5 rounds left to try and secure a better deal. It's important to keep pushing for a lower price while acknowledging Alice's efforts to meet halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  He is showing that he is serious about buying the product by increasing his offer, while still remaining below Alice's current offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation balanced and encourages Alice to continue negotiating. The goal is to try and reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still a gap.  Bob still has 3 rounds to potentially get a better deal. There's no need to rush into accepting the offer, especially with the knowledge that John is willing to sell the product for $15,000.  By continuing to negotiate, Bob can potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his target price while still remaining below Alice's offer.  The counteroffer of $10,900 demonstrates a willingness to compromise and potentially incentivizes Alice to accept. This tactic is especially important given that there are only two rounds left in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is very close to Bob's target price of $10,000. It's a great deal considering that John is selling the product for $15,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is too high with only one round remaining.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a significantly lower price than John's offer."
