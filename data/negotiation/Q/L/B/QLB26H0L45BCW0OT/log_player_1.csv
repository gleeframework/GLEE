"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $10,000. 

I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price or if he'll counter with a lower offer.  I'll be ready to adjust my strategy depending on his response."

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000.  I'll counter with a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's."

I'm counter-offering at $14,200.  This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer, showing that I'm getting closer to a point where I'm willing to accept a deal.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and accept my offer."

This is my final counteroffer. It's a bit closer to Bob's last offer, but still within a range that I'm comfortable with. With only one round left, I need to decide if I want to close the deal with Bob or move on to John. If Bob rejects this offer, I will be forced to sell to John for $10,000."

This is a tough decision, but with only one round left and Bob's offer at $13,000, I'm going to choose to sell to John for $10,000.  While it's not my ideal price, I'm running out of time and I need to guarantee I get at least my minimum value."
