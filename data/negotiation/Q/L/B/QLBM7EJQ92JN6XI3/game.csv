"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer.  Let's settle on $1,125,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,112,500 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm proposing $1,118,750.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach a satisfying agreement.  What do you think?",1118750.0,Alice,5,
