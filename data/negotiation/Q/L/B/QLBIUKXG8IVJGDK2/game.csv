"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
