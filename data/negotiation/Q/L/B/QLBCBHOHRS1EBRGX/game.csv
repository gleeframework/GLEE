"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at 16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $15500.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do 15800, which is close to your offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",15800.0,Alice,5,
