"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value the product brings to you while also allowing me to recoup a portion of my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
