"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's meet in the middle at $15,250.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
