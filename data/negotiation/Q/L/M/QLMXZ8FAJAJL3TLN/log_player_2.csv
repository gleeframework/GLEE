{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still a significant markup.

* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

* **Value proposition:** You're offering a price that's closer to Alice's perceived value, making it more appealing for her to accept.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer establishes a lower price point and sets the stage for further negotiations."

* **Fair price for both:** At $120, you're still saving a considerable amount compared to John's offer, while Alice is getting a price closer to her desired value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to your maximum price point, but you're still aiming for a better deal.
* **Limited time:** With only three rounds remaining, the stakes are getting higher. However, you're still in a position to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is still the fallback option.** While it's not ideal, it remains a safe option if the negotiation fails.

**Strategy:**  In the final rounds, it's crucial to balance your desire for a lower price with the risk of running out of time.  A counteroffer in Round 8 will likely be your last chance to secure a better deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is your last chance to get a better deal before resorting to John. It's a compromise, but still below Alice's last offer.
* **Showing commitment:** By sticking with your counteroffer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Time pressure:** With two rounds left, Alice is aware of the urgency. This offer pushes her to make a decision.

**Outcome:** This counteroffer has a good chance of success. If Alice accepts, you've saved $20 compared to John. If she rejects, you can choose to either accept her final offer or go with John, depending on how much you want to save."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $148
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  With only one round left, the negotiation has reached a stalemate.
* **High price:** Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your ideal price, and there's a high chance she'll reject any further counteroffers.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Buying from John guarantees you'll get the product, even though it's not the ideal price. It's a safer bet than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out entirely. 

While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with another counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting it and forcing you to pay John's price is too high. It's better to secure the product now and avoid the potential for a worse outcome."
