"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a solid return. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
