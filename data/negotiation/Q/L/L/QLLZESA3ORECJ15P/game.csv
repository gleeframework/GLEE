"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of what it offers.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 is my ideal price, I understand we may need to find a middle ground. How about $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's settle this - $14,500 and we have a deal. This is a very fair offer considering the value it brings.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,500 is my absolute bottom line.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer - I have another buyer ready at a higher price, but I believe in being fair with you.  This product is going to change things for you, I know it.",14500.0,Alice,7,
