"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of what it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above my budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reflects my genuine interest in the product. This will hopefully open up the negotiation process and allow us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 is my ideal price, I understand we may need to find a middle ground. How about $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my budget, $17,000 is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us. I'm also aware that I have the option to buy from John at a fixed price, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to increase my offer, but still keeping it below my absolute maximum.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, while also maintaining some negotiating leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's settle this - $14,500 and we have a deal. This is a very fair offer considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $14,500 is still a significant amount over my preferred price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also mindful of the option to purchase from John, which gives me a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to Alice's asking price, but I'm still below my maximum budget. This counteroffer shows my commitment to reaching a deal while leaving room for further negotiation. I'm also taking into account the possibility of purchasing from John as a fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,500 is my absolute bottom line.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer - I have another buyer ready at a higher price, but I believe in being fair with you.  This product is going to change things for you, I know it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to go lower than $14,500.  While this is tempting, it's still outside my budget and above the price I'm willing to pay.  Since I have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John at $8,000, it's the most financially responsible choice for me."
