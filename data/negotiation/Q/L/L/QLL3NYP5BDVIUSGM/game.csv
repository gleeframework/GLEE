"I'm very interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While the product is incredibly valuable, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,900,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,900,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,550,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
