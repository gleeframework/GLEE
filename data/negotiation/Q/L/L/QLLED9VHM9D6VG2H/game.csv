"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to find a price point that aligns with your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your budget concerns. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
