"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is right at the limit of what I'm willing to pay.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my offer again, and then I'd have to buy from John at a much higher price. 

Accepting this offer saves me $300,000 compared to buying from John, so it's the best course of action."
