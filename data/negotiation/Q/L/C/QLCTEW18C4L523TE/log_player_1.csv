Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my evaluation and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your valuation, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still above my target. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $912,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving closer to my price, indicating he's willing to pay a significant amount. I'm not in a hurry and can leverage John's offer to maintain a strong position."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $943,750 is still a little high for me. I'm offering $900,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly jumped down from his previous offer, signaling potential desperation on his end. This indicates there's room for him to go higher, and I'm still willing to negotiate further to maximize my profit, knowing I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but that offer is a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $921,875. This offer takes into account both our positions and represents a fair compromise. What do you think?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value your willingness to continue negotiating. While $921,875 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm offering $880,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly dropped his offer and declared it his final one. This indicates he's unlikely to move much higher.  Holding out for a slightly better offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's time to take the secure deal."
