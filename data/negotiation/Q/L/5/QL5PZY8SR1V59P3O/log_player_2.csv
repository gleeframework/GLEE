"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I think it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $13,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

$12,000 is a good price. It's still a good deal for you and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or you having to deal with John."
