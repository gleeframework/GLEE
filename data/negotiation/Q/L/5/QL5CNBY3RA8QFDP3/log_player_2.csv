"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive and set a price point that is closer to his ideal price. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice needs to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,500, which is within Bob's budget and a good price for him. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking a further negotiation that might lead to him having to pay more or buying from John for $15,000."
