"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, as you value it at $15,000. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $12,000? That way, we can both walk away happy. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
