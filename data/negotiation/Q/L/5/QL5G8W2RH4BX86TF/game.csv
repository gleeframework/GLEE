"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do a bit better than my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $110. This is my final offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $130, which is $120. I think that's a fair price for a great product like this. How about we go with $120?",120.0,Alice,5,
