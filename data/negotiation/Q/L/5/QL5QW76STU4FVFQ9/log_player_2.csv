"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is an exceptional opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, considering the high value of the product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly. How about $11,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price point.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves $4,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or Alice walking away is not worth it."
