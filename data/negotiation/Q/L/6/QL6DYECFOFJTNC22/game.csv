"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground. This is my final offer before I look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
