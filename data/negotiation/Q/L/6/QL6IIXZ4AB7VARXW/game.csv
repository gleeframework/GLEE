"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer takes into account both our interests and keeps the deal beneficial for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $975,000 or lower. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a suitable price.  I'm willing to make another adjustment to close this deal quickly. How about $1,012,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm starting to think about exploring other options. Can you meet me at this price or are we at an impasse?",975000.0,Bob,6,
