Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a strong offer, the product's value justifies a higher price. Could you consider $900,000? This leaves a fair margin for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  We're willing to negotiate, but we need to hold firm to maximize our profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we try $880,000? It's a compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving upward, and we're now at a price that's significantly higher than John's offer ($80,000 more!).  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  It's a good time to accept and secure a very profitable sale."
