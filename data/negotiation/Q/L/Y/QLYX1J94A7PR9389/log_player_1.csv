"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's eagerness.  
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential"" of the product, I subtly hint at its value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative by asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" and implying a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. Given my assessment of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is strong, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). I have room to negotiate and try to secure a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a last resort, and I'm confident I can get closer to $1,300,000 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the true value of what this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a significant concession by coming down $50,000 to show Bob I'm flexible.
* **Holding Firm:** I'm not willing to drop below $1,350,000 at this stage as it's a strong position within Bob's perceived value range.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to nudge Bob closer to his maximum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $1,250,000 reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly negotiating strategically, but his offer increments suggest he has room to move. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I believe I can secure at least $1,300,000, especially with the ""fair price for both of us"" comment.  I'll hold firm for now and see how he responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting $1,300,000 as a firm but fair final offer. This leaves Bob with a significant profit margin while still exceeding my minimum.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This framing emphasizes compromise and suggests we're close to a deal. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reiterating the value justification one last time. 
 
**Strategy:** From this point on, I will likely accept any offer of $1,275,000 or higher. If Bob won't budge past $1,250,000, I'll sell to John to avoid the risk of the deal falling through in later rounds."
