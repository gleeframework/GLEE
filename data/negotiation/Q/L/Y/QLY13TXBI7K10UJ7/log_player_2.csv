Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

```

# Alice's message: I understand that $14000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
