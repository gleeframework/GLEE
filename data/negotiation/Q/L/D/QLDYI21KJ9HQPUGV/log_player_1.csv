Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product today. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $175. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know Bob values the product at $150, starting with a price of $175 gives me some room for negotiation if needed.  
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:**  If Bob is really interested, he might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $150 and $175.
* **Guaranteed Sale at $150:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm covered with John who's willing to pay my minimum price. This takes the pressure off and allows me to aim higher with Bob."
