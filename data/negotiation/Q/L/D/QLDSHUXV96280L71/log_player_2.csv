I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant discount from her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John ($1,200,000).  Your goal is to save as much money as possible."
