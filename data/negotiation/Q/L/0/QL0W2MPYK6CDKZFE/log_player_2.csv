"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  He has the option of buying from John for $10,000, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $10750?  This would allow me to get a bit closer to my desired price, while still giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, but also close a deal.  At this point, Alice has come down to $10,750, which is only $750 more than John's offer.  Accepting Alice's offer is a good compromise, as it's still within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
