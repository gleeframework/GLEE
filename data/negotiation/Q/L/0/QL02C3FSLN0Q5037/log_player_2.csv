"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,250,000) is higher than John's price ($1,000,000).**  You can save a significant amount of money by going with John. 
* **Alice's message contains pressure tactics.** Her claims about another buyer and the product's worth to you are irrelevant. Focus on the actual numbers.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John at your desired price."
