"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $12000 on this purchase. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price within this range?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe that $12000 is the maximum I can realistically spend on this product. I hope we can come to an agreement closer to my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
