"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's significant room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if I can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $90, I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to her perceived value of $80. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives us space to meet in the middle if Alice rejects it. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed positively and expresses my interest while clearly stating my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice met me in the middle, which is a fair negotiation tactic. $100 is a reasonable price, saving me $20 compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Saved:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings are likely small. Accepting now saves time and guarantees I get the product."
