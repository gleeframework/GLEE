"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is a good start, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $125 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. It's close to her value, but leaves me with a good amount of savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. I'm still willing to try for a slightly lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and meet at $107.50?"",
 ""product_price"": 107.5
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a good deal. By suggesting a specific number, it might encourage Alice to do the same and avoid drawn-out back-and-forth."
