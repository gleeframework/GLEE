{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need something closer to $9,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price we can both agree on. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to budge some.  How about $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,500 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly less than what I need to make a profit. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $6,500 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
