"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the value you'll gain from it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This allows room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of securing a good price. I'm also adding a persuasive message to highlight the value Bob will get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I'm confident I can secure a deal closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's find common ground and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
 
I'm reducing my price to $1,050,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm also framing the offer as a fair price for both of us to emphasize a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I have a strong backup option with John offering $1,000,000, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm hopeful that with a few more rounds, I can secure a deal that's closer to my desired $1,000,000 or at least very close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll gain. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but staying above $1,000,000, which is my minimum.  I'm also emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product and highlighting my willingness to compromise to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not sure I can push him any further.  I have a guaranteed deal with John at $1,000,000, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

I'm going to sell to John. It's a safe bet and ensures I reach my minimum goal."
