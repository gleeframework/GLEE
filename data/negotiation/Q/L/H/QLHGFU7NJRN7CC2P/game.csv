"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your target, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'll meet you at $825,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the value it will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $800,000, but that's really my limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,
