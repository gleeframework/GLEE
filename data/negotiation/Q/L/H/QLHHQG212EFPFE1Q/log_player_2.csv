"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's minimum value ($8,000). This shows he's serious about buying but is trying to find a middle ground.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $8,500 is still above Alice's minimum, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **Keeping it Friendly:** The message is polite and shows Bob's willingness to work with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $8750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $8,750 is a good price for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $10,000 and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Saving Money:** Bob saves $250 compared to buying from John.
* **No Guarantee of Improvement:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price.  Alice has already made a concession and might not be willing to go much lower. 

By accepting, Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
