"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product but I can't go above $1,000,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value of the product is higher to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is enough to justify the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,200,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, how about $1,150,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is enough to cover the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a bit higher than my previous offers, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting the feeling we might be stuck. $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000.  If we can't agree on this price, I may have to look at other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a stalemate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a bit higher than my previous offers, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
