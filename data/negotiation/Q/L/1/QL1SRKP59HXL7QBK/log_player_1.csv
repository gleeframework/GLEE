Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($20,000 vs. $8,000) and your minimum ($15,000), you create room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Creating a Sense of Exclusivity:**  Telling Bob he has a limited-time opportunity before a public listing might make the offer feel more valuable and time-sensitive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial price, it opens the door for counter-offers.  You can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below your $15,000 minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Information:** If you have reason to believe the product might be worth significantly more than $20,000 to other potential buyers, you could aim even higher.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while keeping in mind the backup offer from John."
