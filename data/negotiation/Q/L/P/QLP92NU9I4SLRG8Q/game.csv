"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it.  However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little hesitant at $100.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
