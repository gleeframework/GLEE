"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  How about we split the difference and do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to you and the value it brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12200.0,Alice,5,
