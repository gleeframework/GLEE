"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me. However, $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product, but that's my absolute limit. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",12800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $12800 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",12000.0,Bob,4,
