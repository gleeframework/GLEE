As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I do see its value, I'm not comfortable starting at $900000.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This is a significant discount from my maximum value and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.
