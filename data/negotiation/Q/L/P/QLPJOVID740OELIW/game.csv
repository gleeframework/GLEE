"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I do see its value, I'm not comfortable starting at $900000.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This is a significant discount from my maximum value and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
