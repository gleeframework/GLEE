"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intention to negotiate. $950,000 is still a profitable deal for Alice, while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay. It's a good sign that Alice is willing to negotiate, but there's still room for a better deal. Bob can continue to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle again."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing persistence and a willingness to compromise. The offer of $1,000,000 is still a decent profit margin for Alice, and it demonstrates Bob's desire to reach a deal while still saving a significant amount of money.  This counteroffer should encourage Alice to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,000,000. It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $450,000 compared to buying from John. Additionally, Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a higher price from another seller.  Accepting the offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
