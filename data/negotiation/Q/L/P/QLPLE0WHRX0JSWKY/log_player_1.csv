"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, making it more appealing for him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message ends with ""Let me know what you think"", making it clear I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price and my ideal outcome. I believe I can still get a better price, especially since Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. I will counter-offer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a reasonable drop:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility but not giving away too much.
* **Reminding Bob of the value:** I'm reminding Bob about the value the product holds for him, making it more appealing to accept a higher price.
* **Focusing on meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting a compromise, which increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,000,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth, especially considering Bob's stated value for it.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round.  We still have several rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** I'm setting a tone of finality by stating this is my final offer before exploring other options. This creates pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting him halfway between our last offers. This shows a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm still reminding him of the product's value and why this price is fair. 

By using these tactics, I hope to push Bob towards accepting my offer while also leaving open the possibility of moving on to John if he refuses."
