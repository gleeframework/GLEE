"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very special product that I believe would be of immense value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, which I'm sure we both know is quite substantial.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is indeed special, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's desired price point.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's higher price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice.  Bob saves $200,000 compared to John's offer."
