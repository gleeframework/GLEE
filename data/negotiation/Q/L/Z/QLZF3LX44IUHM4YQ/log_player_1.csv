Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is indeed special, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
