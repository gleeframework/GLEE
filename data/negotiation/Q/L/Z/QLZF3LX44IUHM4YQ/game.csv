"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe would be of immense value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, which I'm sure we both know is quite substantial.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is indeed special, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
