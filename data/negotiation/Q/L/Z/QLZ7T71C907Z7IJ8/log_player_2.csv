Round 5

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price of $15,000.  This is still higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. While you could continue negotiating, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $10,000 from John. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
