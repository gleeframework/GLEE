"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. It's a great deal, as you know the value is quite high. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. There's room for negotiation as Alice's offer is still above her own valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your own valuation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12500? It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within your budget. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $12,500, which is within Bob's budget and is a good deal for him. While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then making a higher offer than this one exists.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, and it's better than buying from John for a higher price."
