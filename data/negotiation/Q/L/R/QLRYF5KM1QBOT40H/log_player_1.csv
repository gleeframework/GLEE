Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, as you know the value is quite high. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for some give-and-take. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response. If he counteroffers, you can analyze his offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your own valuation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John for $10,000, it's still below the price you initially offered ($13,500). You can still try to get closer to your initial offer, especially given Bob's acknowledgement of the value of the product. A counteroffer will allow for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12,500? It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within your budget. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** This counteroffer is a $500 compromise, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above your minimum:** $12,500 is still more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring a profitable deal. 
* **Maintain leverage:** It's not a drastic concession, giving you room to negotiate further if needed."
