"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. By starting significantly lower, I aim to encourage Alice to meet me closer to the middle ground. It's still important to remain respectful and polite throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I understand it's a lot of money, but this product is really special. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met my walk-away price. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
