Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to build rapport.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential middle ground. 
* **John as a backup:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $120, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $100. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price. I can use the fact that John is willing to pay $120 as leverage in negotiations.
* **Maintaining my position:**  By rejecting the offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to walk away if necessary, making Bob more likely to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I understand it's a lot of money, but this product is really special. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer near Bob's value:**  I'm offering $100, which is closer to Bob's perceived value of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price. 
* **Focus on ""good deal"":**  I'm framing the $100 offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us. This appeals to Bob's desire to get a good price while also implying that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** I'm not mentioning John's offer of $120 yet. I want to see if I can reach a deal with Bob before resorting to that."
