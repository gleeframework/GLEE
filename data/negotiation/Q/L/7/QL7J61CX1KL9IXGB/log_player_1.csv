{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth even more in your hands.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point higher than Bob's value but lower than your minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring you can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. Let's keep this momentum going!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, $13,250 is a decent deal and a good outcome for this negotiation."
