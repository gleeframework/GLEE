"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do much better than $1,200,000.  He has a clear upper limit of $1,500,000 and should try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer is also below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000, giving him some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's first offer, Bob can still get a better deal.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying below his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a good middle ground and could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than the price offered by John.  This is a good deal for Bob, and accepting the offer allows him to secure the product at a lower price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee and it risks losing the deal altogether."
