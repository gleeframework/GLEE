"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10500? This price still allows for a reasonable profit for me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. $10500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $9750? This would give us both a good deal and avoid the need to go back and forth further.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9750 is still not quite where I need to be. How about $10000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price while still giving you a great deal.  Let's try to wrap this up, as I'm also considering other offers.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
