{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob. This might pique his interest and make him more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hard line, leaving the door open for a counteroffer from Bob.

**Remember:** This is just the first step. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider factors like his counteroffer, his perceived value of the product, and my willingness to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $12000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's potential for a more favorable counteroffer. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob. I'll need to balance the need to secure a better price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This price still reflects the unique value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $17,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I won't accept a price that's less than what I'm comfortable with.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to maintain Bob's interest.
* **Opening for Negotiation:** I'm again leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to analyze Bob's response and decide whether to continue negotiating or go with John's offer if it's the best outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make an offer of $15000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Further Negotiation:**  There's no real benefit to continuing the negotiation.  I've already come down to my minimum, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer.
* **Equal Value:**  John is offering the same price as Bob, so there's no financial advantage in selling to either one.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option.  It's a fair price that meets my minimum requirements, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome."
