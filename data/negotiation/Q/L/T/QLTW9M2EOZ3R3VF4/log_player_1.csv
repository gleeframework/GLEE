{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is strategic. It's a decent discount from what the product is worth to me, making it attractive to Bob. But it's also a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for me to potentially make more money. I'll see if Bob accepts or counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, it's not worth sacrificing that much profit. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's still a good deal for you and leaves me some room to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is closer but still a little high for me. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not comfortable accepting such a low price yet. I'll make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $85? That's a good price for both of us. If you're still not comfortable with that, I may have to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
