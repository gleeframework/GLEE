"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's still a good deal for you and leaves me some room to make a profit.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 is closer but still a little high for me. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $85? That's a good price for both of us. If you're still not comfortable with that, I may have to go with another buyer.",85.0,Alice,5,
