You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's still a good deal for you and leaves me some room to make a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $85? That's a good price for both of us. If you're still not comfortable with that, I may have to go with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80. It's better to secure the product at your target price with John rather than risk Alice walking away."
