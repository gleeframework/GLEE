Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,500 is still too far off from what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still be getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
