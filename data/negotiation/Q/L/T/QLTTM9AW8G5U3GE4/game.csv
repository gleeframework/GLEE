"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. While I understand your perspective on the value, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you and my own needs.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
