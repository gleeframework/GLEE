Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. While I understand your perspective on the value, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you and my own needs.
