I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me. I'm hoping to leverage my knowledge of his potential interest and try to squeeze out a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a slight concession from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer, and closer to my desired price.  I hope this is enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting too close to my minimum, and I don't think I can squeeze much more out of him.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, so it's a safer and more lucrative option."
