"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $2,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially create a sense of urgency.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for significant negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so this offer gives me a strong negotiation position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum threshold, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired outcome.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe there's room for negotiation. I can explore a counteroffer closer to my initial price, hopefully finding a middle ground.
* **Time on My Side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me time to negotiate and potentially improve the price. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would secure a sale, but it's far less than what I could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. Let's split the difference and go with $2,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining High Value:**  This price still reflects the significant value of the product, while acknowledging Bob's initial concerns.
* **Showcasing Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Increased Pressure:**  With each round, the risk of selling to John for $1,000,000 becomes more real, creating a bit of pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2150000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $2150000. How about $2000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $2,000,000 is closer to my desired price range and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Momentum Shift:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and accepting his offer could lead to a quick and favorable outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially negotiate higher in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away or further lowering his offer increases.
* **Time Constraint:** With 6 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer secures a good sale while leaving time for potential future deals."
