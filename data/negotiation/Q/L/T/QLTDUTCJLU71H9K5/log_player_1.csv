"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my price, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open Ended:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a favorable position and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm happy Bob is interested, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a price lower than my minimum. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again mentioning the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Open Ended:** I'm using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage further.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room for negotiation. I can make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher price. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, which provides a safety net if I can't reach a satisfactory price with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and try to get a better deal without risking selling below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fantastic deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're ready to close this."" , ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** I'm now offering my absolute minimum price, demonstrating my willingness to close the deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make $100 seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Direct Call to Action:**  I'm asking Bob directly if he's ready to close the deal, putting the pressure on him to make a decision.

This strategy aims to:

* Secure my minimum acceptable price.
* Push Bob to make a decision and close the deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I can proceed to John, ensuring a sale at my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to pay $92 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There is a high chance we won't reach an agreement if I continue. 
* **Guaranteed deal:** John's offer of $100 provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum.  This is the safest option given the circumstances. 

I've attempted to negotiate with Bob, but his offers haven't reached my minimum. To avoid losing the opportunity to sell at my minimum price, I will sell to John."
