"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1400000 simply wouldn't be fair to me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1575000.  Let's make this happen.",1575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1575000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1500000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
