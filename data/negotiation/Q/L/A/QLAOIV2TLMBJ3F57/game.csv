"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go down to $105 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $107.50. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $106.  Let's try to work something out.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $106 just yet. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer it to you for $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
