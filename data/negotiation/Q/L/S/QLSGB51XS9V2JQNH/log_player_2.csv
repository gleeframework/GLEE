Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion.  However, to be completely transparent, your initial offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial position, but I can't accept anything below $1,850,000.  This price point takes into account the value it offers while leaving some room for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 falls quite a bit short of what I consider a fair deal.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to make one more move to seal the deal with you. Would you consider $1,650,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing hardball and her ""final offer"" is still significantly above your alternative option with John. It's unlikely she'll move much further, and you're running the risk of her accepting another offer. Buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees you get the product at the best price you've established."
