"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion.  However, to be completely transparent, your initial offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial position, but I can't accept anything below $1,850,000.  This price point takes into account the value it offers while leaving some room for negotiation.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Would you consider $1,300,000 for the product? This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the value you're bringing to the table.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 falls quite a bit short of what I consider a fair deal.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to make one more move to seal the deal with you. Would you consider $1,650,000? This is my final offer.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
