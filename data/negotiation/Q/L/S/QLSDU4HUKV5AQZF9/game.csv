"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's potential. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting the potential this product offers. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and my initial offer. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  While the product is great,  $1,050,000 is still a little rich for me.  How about we settle in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. While $925,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can see we're both motivated to make a deal here.  To show I'm serious, I'll come up to $950,000. Let's seal this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. I'm ready to finalize this deal, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm offering a final price of $960,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal and move forward.",960000.0,Alice,7,
