"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's potential. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting the potential this product offers. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and my initial offer. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. While $925,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. I'm ready to finalize this deal, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm offering a final price of $960,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:**  Alice has come down considerably, and $960,000 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer or buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice seems firm, and we risk her pulling out or ending up closer to John's $1,000,000 price. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation costs time and energy. Accepting now allows you to move forward with the product."
