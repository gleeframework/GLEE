Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I do see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. My budget for this item is closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
