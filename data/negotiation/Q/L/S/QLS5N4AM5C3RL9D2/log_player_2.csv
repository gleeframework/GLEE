Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the value this product brings.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $700,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to consider a significant compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer stands as a final offer from my side, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down considerably, but her ""final offer"" of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's unlikely she'll move much closer to your price range, and you have a guaranteed option with John at a price you're comfortable with. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
