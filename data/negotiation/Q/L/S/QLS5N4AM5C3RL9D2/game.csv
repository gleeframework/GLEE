"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable paying.  To be frank, I'm targeting something closer to $700,000.  If that's not feasible, I might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $700,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to consider a significant compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer stands as a final offer from my side, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
