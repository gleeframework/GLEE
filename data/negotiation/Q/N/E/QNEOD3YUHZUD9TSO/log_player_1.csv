"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable, so there's a good chance he'll accept. However, if he rejects, I have room to lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids further negotiation."
