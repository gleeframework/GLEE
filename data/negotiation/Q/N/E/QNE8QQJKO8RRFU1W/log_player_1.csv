Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I acknowledge the product's value to me, emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, potentially decreasing my price slightly.
* If the negotiation stalls or drags on, I'll have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** 
* **I am willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.**
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and open the door for further negotiations.**

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price point.  I will likely offer a price slightly below my minimum, leaving room for compromise.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will assess if his counter-counteroffer is more acceptable, or if I should proceed with selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still leaves some room for profit for me, while also allowing you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer, bridging the gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer.
* **Reasonable Adjustment:** The price is a significant increase from Bob's offer but leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the value the product provides for both of us, framing the price as a win-win situation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counter-offer, I will analyze his next counter-offer carefully. If it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I may consider accepting.
* If Bob's offer remains too low, I'll assess if I should make another counter-offer or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I'm still working within my budget. I would like to propose $11,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this suggestion is more aligned with what we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing negotiations may be time-consuming and ultimately lead to a similar price point.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher price could risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially missing out on a sale altogether.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. 
* I will then focus on fulfilling the sale and ensuring a positive experience for Bob."
