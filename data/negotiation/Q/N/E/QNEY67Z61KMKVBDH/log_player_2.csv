"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.  This is a great opportunity to own a unique and valuable item.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 for the product and Alice is offering it for $10,000, there's no immediate advantage to accepting her offer.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
