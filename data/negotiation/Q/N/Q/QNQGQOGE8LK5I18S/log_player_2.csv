"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between its value to you and its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can do better.  You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might come down further in price if you reject her initial offer."
