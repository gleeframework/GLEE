Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This price is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than what I could get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still giving me a good profit.  I'll be ready to counter any offers he makes, but if he's not willing to meet me halfway, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $10,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'll sell to John and secure the full $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise between my original offer of $12,000 and his counteroffer of $10,000.  I believe this price is still fair, given the value of the product to both of us. If Bob is not willing to meet me at this price, I will proceed with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000, and I'm confident that John will pay me the full $15,000. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John."
