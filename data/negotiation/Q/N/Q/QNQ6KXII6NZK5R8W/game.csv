"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest,  $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500? This still gives you a good deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. I'd like to counter with an offer of $13,200 for the product.",13200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,200 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's meet in the middle at $13,400. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further negotiation. What do you say?",13400.0,Alice,5,
