Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your minimum value of $100.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired price point.  You can likely get more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a good profit.  Let's see if Bob's willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob's offer is now the same as John's, but the negotiation is getting frustrating. It's unlikely that Bob will budge any further, and further rounds are only going to cost me time.  

I'm going to go ahead and sell to John. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than the risk of losing out to Bob completely and getting nothing."
