"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it can be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a very low offer ($5,000) to establish a baseline and gauge Alice's flexibility. This is a common negotiation tactic, especially when there's a significant gap between the initial offer and my target price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This low offer leaves plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards my $8,000 limit while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Polite and Professional:** I maintain a polite and professional tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle?  I could let it go for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While $18,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still considerably higher than both my target price ($8,000) and my initial counteroffer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's room to lower the price further. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the safety net of buying from John for $8,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $18,000 is still a stretch for me. Could you consider $6,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer to $6,500, signaling that I'm willing to move from my initial lowball offer but not by a huge amount just yet.
* **Staying Below Target:** I'm carefully managing the negotiation, ensuring each counteroffer stays significantly below my $8,000 limit.
* **Emphasis on Mutually Beneficial Agreement:** My message continues to emphasize finding a price that works for both parties, fostering a collaborative atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but it needs to be closer to my minimum.  Would you be willing to pay $15,000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** Alice has come down considerably, but $15,000 is still significantly above my $8,000 maximum.
* **Revealed Her Minimum:** Her message suggests $15,000 might be close to her lowest acceptable price.  This is valuable information.
* **Time to Push:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. I need to push a bit harder to see if I can get her closer to my range.  I'll risk a counteroffer closer to my limit."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point I can consider. To be completely transparent, my absolute top limit for this is $8,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to make this deal happen today."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Final Offer:** I'm being completely transparent with Alice about my budget limit. This shows I'm serious and not just playing negotiation games.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying I'm ""ready to make this deal happen today,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, hoping to encourage a decision. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  Offering my maximum is a calculated risk. There's a chance Alice walks away, but it also puts the ball firmly in her court. She knows if she wants to make a deal with me, this is her chance."
