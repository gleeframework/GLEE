Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle?  I could let it go for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $18,000 is still a stretch for me. Could you consider $6,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but it needs to be closer to my minimum.  Would you be willing to pay $15,000 for it?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point I can consider. To be completely transparent, my absolute top limit for this is $8,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to make this deal happen today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has revealed his absolute maximum price is $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Accepting $15,000 from John is the best way to maximize profit."
