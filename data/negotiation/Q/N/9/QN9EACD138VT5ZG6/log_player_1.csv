Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a decent margin above my minimum of $150, while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still a bit lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I can secure my desired minimum profit and move on."
