"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, so I'm starting the price at $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate and try to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($80) leaves room for negotiation while signaling my budget limitations clearly.
* **Polite and expressing interest:** Maintaining a positive tone and showing interest in the product can encourage Alice to work towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $200 is my ideal price, I understand that's a bit high for your budget. How about meeting in the middle at $140?  It's a really great product, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still significantly higher than both my budget and what John is offering. I need to hold firm and see if I can negotiate her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $90? That would make it a feasible option for me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but not too much to suggest I'll accept any price close to her initial offer.
* **Reiterating budget constraints:**  By mentioning my budget again, I'm reminding Alice of my limitations and encouraging a more realistic counter-offer. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and appreciative tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $115? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $115, and while it's a better price than her previous offers, it's still more than I want to spend. John offers the product for $100, which is my target price.  It's time to cut my losses with Alice and secure the deal with John."
