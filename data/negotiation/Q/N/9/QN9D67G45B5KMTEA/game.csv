"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $200 is my ideal price, I understand that's a bit high for your budget. How about meeting in the middle at $140?  It's a really great product, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $90? That would make it a feasible option for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $115? That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
