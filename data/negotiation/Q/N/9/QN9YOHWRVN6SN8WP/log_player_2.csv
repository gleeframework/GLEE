"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a productive negotiation.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to negotiate down, leveraging the fact you have John as a backup option."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000  significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true value of this product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  I need to see some movement from your side to make this work."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,750,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement on your end.  To be frank, I have another offer to consider at a lower price.  If I could make this work at $800,000, I'd be prepared to close the deal today.  What do you say?"",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, but so do I.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to close at a higher price.  However, I've enjoyed our conversations and believe in a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has shown she's unwilling to come down to a price that makes sense for you. She's revealed her bottom line is $1,500,000, which is too high.  You've given her a chance to match your alternative, and she declined. It's time to walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
