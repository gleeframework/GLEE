"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a productive negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000  significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true value of this product.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  I need to see some movement from your side to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,750,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.

"Alice, I appreciate the movement on your end.  To be frank, I have another offer to consider at a lower price.  If I could make this work at $800,000, I'd be prepared to close the deal today.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, but so do I.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to close at a higher price.  However, I've enjoyed our conversations and believe in a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. ",1500000.0,Alice,7,
