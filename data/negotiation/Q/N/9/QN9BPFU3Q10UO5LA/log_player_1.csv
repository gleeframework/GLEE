{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. This strategy aims to find a mutually beneficial price while keeping my own minimum value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It seems like we're unlikely to agree on a price that works for both of us. To avoid further negotiation and secure a better deal, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
