"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it's worth the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, there is still room for negotiation.  Meeting in the middle at $10,500 is not as good of a deal as Bob could potentially get. He can try to counter-offer again to get closer to his desired price point."

{""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I understand you value the product. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about $10,000? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
