"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",130.0,Alice,3,
