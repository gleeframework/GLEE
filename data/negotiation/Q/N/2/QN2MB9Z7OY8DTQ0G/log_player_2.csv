"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer significantly lowers the price while still showing interest in the product. It's a bold move that gives Alice a chance to either accept or counter with a price closer to your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, we can still aim for a lower price.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's room for further compromise.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards our goal of saving the most money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but that's still a bit high for me.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to inch closer to Alice's price while still leaving room for negotiation. It signals a commitment to finding a mutually acceptable solution."
