Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We've negotiated well:**  We've got Alice down $180,000 from her initial offer.
* **Diminishing returns:**  Future counteroffers are unlikely to yield significant savings. We're now in a back-and-forth where Alice is conceding very small amounts.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  

While we could potentially squeeze out a few thousand more, the risk of Alice walking away and the small potential gain make $720,000 a reasonable price to close the deal."
