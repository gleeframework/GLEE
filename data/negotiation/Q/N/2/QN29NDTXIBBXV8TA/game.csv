"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. This is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little.  To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to, and I can't go above $700,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can close this out.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
