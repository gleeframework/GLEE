This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential negotiation.  It also frames the offer as beneficial to both of us, encouraging Bob to be more open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his."
