"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my maximum limit. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,100,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000. This price is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has moved a significant amount from his initial offer. There's still room to try and secure a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, $1,800,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $1,950,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,750,000.  This price is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to pay more. We're getting closer to a desirable price point, so it's worth pushing a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,850,000?  This ensures we both feel good about the deal."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  

While we could push for more, Bob's offer is now at $1,700,000. The increments by which he's increasing his offer are getting smaller. Holding out risks pushing him away completely, and we are already well above John's offer.  Accepting now secures a significant profit."
