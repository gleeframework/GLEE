"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a bit more than my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
