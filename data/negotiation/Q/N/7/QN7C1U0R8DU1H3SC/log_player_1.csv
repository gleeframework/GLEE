Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead to you getting a better price.
* **Knowing Your Alternatives:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150.  This means you don't have to accept any offer below that price.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $180, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always counter-offer or move on to John."
