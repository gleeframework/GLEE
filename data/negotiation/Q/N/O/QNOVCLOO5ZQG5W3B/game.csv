"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I can't go that low. How about $12,500? This is a significant discount from my original price and still leaves you with a good margin. Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you consider $11,000? That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $11,500? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
