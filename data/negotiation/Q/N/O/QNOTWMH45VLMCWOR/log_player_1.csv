"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, but I'm still holding out for a little bit more. This price is slightly above what Bob is willing to pay, but I'm hoping the pressure of limited rounds will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum threshold, and we are halfway through the negotiation. I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it seems he's not willing to meet my price. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob in the remaining rounds."
