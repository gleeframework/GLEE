"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Staying Realistic:** While we want to save money, offering a price too low (like $80) might be insulting and make Alice less willing to negotiate. $110 is a reasonable starting point, slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product. 
* **Polite and Open:**  The message aims to maintain a positive and collaborative tone throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. I'm confident you'll find that a very fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
**Reasoning:** 

Alice moved her price down, which is good.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate, and we haven't reached a point where John's offer is the better option. It makes sense to counteroffer again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a price directly in between Alice's current offer ($130) and our previous offer ($110). This strategy often feels like a fair compromise to both parties.
* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know Alice values the product at $120. By offering this price, we're giving her a chance to still make a profit (even if minimal) while potentially securing the best possible price for ourselves.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message keeps the tone positive and avoids unnecessary complexity. We're aiming for a straightforward agreement."
