"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, so I'm starting the price at $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth less than $200 to me. I would like to propose a price of $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price, I know John is readily available to buy it at that price. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher in subsequent rounds, and I risk getting a lower offer. It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
