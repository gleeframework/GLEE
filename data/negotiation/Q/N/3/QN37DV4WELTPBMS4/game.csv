"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only offer $120 right now.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135.  This would allow us both to walk away with a win.  What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
