"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me this product.  While I'm interested, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price, how about we agree on $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,056,875. This is the sweet spot for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1056875.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close! I can feel it.  Let's split the difference again and call it a deal at $1,034,687.50.  This is my final offer.",1034687.5,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to accept your offer of $1,034,687.50. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering $1,087,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1087500.0,Alice,9,
