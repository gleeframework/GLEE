"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? It's the best I can do at this point.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $10,150.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  It's your final chance to make a deal. If not, I'll have to accept another offer.",10150.0,Alice,5,
