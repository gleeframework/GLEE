"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit from my original price. How about $125?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $140, but $125 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $125, so how about $120? That's the price I was thinking of paying in the first place, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",120.0,Bob,4,
