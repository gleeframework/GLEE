Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit from my original price. How about $125?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.
