{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is above the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Value proposition:** I'm mentioning the product's usefulness to highlight its worth.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  Selling to John for $120 is always a safe option, but I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum just yet.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit from my original price. How about $125?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing understanding for his budget.
* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price of $125, which is a compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlight fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, stressing the value of the product and my need to make a profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with an open question, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and find a mutually acceptable solution.

This approach aims to bridge the gap between our offers, keep the negotiation open, and hopefully reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $140, but $125 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $125, so how about $120? That's the price I was thinking of paying in the first place, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further negotiation needed:** There's no point in further negotiation as I'm already at my lower limit. 
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of potentially losing a sale by continuing to negotiate.

While I could try to counteroffer again and aim for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential gain. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is the best outcome considering my limited negotiation leverage at this point."
