Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little bit of room to work with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? This way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
