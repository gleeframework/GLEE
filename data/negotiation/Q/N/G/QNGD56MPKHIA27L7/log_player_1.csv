Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000** is a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's estimated value ($1,200,000).
* This offer gives Bob a significant discount and increases the likelihood of his acceptance. 
* If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on any profit."
