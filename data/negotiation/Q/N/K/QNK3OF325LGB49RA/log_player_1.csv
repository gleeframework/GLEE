Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $115?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
