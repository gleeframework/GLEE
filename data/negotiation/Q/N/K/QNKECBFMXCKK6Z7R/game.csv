"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. However, I'm open to discussing a price that works best for both of us. ",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher figure, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the true value and potential of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
