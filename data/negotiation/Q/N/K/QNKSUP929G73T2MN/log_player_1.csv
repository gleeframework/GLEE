Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This reflects the true worth of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I'm not sure I can stretch further than that.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely to reach a point where I'd make more than John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to move on."
