"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach a minimum of $950,000 to make it worthwhile. Can we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,5,
