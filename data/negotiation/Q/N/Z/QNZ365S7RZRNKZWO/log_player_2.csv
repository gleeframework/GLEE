"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  There's no chance of getting a lower price."
