Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $90? I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to go through another round of counteroffers to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.  That's a fair compromise, considering the value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $92 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum threshold and significantly better than selling to John for $80. It also seems like Bob is firm on his offer, so further negotiation might not yield a better result."
