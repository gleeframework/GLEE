"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $120.**  You're looking to save as much as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.**  You can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a guaranteed way to get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $90? I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $120.** You're aiming for the lowest price possible.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.**  There's still room to potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, John is your alternative."
