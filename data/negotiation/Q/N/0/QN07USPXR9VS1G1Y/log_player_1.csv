"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I'm offering this product to you at a price of $18,000.  It's a high-quality item with a lot of value, and I believe this price reflects that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I have 10 rounds and can potentially get a better price.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer of $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go down to $15,000 at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair compromise given the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $16000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer and is getting closer to my desired price. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $15,000.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's a good chance I can push for a higher price, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
