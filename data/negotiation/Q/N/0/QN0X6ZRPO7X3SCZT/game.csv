"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the special price, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering it's within your budget and allows me to stay within mine. Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $102. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. I think it's still a great value for the product, and I hope you can see it that way too.",102.0,Alice,5,
