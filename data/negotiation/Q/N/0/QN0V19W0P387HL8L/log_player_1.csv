Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $14,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  He might counter-offer, and you can potentially meet in the middle, still earning more than $10,000.
* **Assessing Value Perception:** By starting high, you gauge Bob's perception of the product's value. If he accepts outright, you've maximized your profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might adjust the initial offer slightly lower, though still above $10,000.
* **Market Context:** If similar products are commonly sold at much higher prices, you could justify an even higher initial offer."
