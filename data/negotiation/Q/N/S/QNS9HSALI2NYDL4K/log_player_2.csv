# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however.  How about $1,100,000?  This price still allows for a reasonable profit for me, while also giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  What are your thoughts?
