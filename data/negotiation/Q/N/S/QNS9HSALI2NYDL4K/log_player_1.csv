Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  My asking price is $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential for your company.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,500,000), which may encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* It's also still above Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving him a chance to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit. 
* The message is friendly and professional, highlighting the product's potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however.  How about $1,100,000?  This price still allows for a reasonable profit for me, while also giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer of $1,300,000, showing flexibility.  It's also higher than Bob's offer of $900,000,  keeping some room for negotiation. 
* The message acknowledges Bob's position while expressing my own needs.  It uses a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
*  By offering a specific counteroffer, I'm showing that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob, but only at a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  Rather than continue to negotiate with Bob and potentially risk getting stuck at a price that is not in my best interest, I'm going to take John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000. This ensures that I achieve my minimum desired value and avoid further haggling."
