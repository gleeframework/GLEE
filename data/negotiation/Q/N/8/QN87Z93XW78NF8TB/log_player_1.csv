{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still attractive to Bob as he can still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000,  which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for your product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering its value to me. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum.  Considering the risk of him walking away completely or me having to accept John's offer for $800,000, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option."
