"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the starting price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and rarity.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $1400000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's unique features and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1600000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're getting closer to my target price, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000 just yet. Considering the product's exclusivity and the potential returns, I'm willing to offer a slight discount. My new counteroffer is $1680000. I believe this price still reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to offer a slight discount, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1550000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm getting close to the point where I'll need to consider other options, including buying from John for $1500000.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1575000. I believe this price is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John for $1500000.",1575000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're getting close to your limit, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final push. Considering the product's exclusivity and the potential returns, I'm willing to meet you at $1600000 was my previous offer, but now I'll go even lower to $1580000. I believe this price is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1580000.0,Alice,9,
