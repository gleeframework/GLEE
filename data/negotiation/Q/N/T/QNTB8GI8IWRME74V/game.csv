"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9000 is a significant concession, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10200.0,Alice,5,
