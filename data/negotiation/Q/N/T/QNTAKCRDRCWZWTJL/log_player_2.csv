Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to hear you're willing to come up a little bit, Bob! I'm still not willing to go all the way to $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $11,100. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is incrementally approaching my ideal price. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice might not budge much more. Accepting at $11,100 secures a reasonable deal."
