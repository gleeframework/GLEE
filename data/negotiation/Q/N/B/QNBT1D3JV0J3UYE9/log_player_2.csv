"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is lower than her actual value of the product, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best decision."
