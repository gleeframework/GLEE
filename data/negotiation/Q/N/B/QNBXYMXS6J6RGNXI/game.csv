"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a significant discount from my original asking price. This product is worth a lot more than that to your business, and I'm sure you'll see a strong return on your investment.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
