"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $10,000, which is $8,750. Let's see if we can make it work.",8750.0,Alice,5,
