Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?,950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $880000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $890000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
