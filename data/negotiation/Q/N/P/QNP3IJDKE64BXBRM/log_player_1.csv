Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $7,000 is getting closer, it's still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
