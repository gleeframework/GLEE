"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** I provide a brief but positive justification for the high price, focusing on ""unique value"" and ""potential"" without revealing specific details that Bob could use against me.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I signal that I'm willing to negotiate (""open to discussing further""), which is crucial for a successful negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Establish a high starting point that influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, counteroffer) will reveal valuable information about his willingness to pay. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate and potentially pay more. However, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 

Therefore, I choose to reject his offer and proceed to the next round to negotiate a better deal. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table, as I believe Bob might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand your position, but the $1,200,000 price doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to move from my initial price, so to find a middle ground, I propose $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** It's important to show Bob that his offer was heard and considered, even though it was rejected. This maintains a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Justifying the Rejection:** I briefly explain my rejection by reiterating the product's value without being overly aggressive.
* **Significant Price Reduction:** To show flexibility and encourage Bob to counter, I've made a considerable reduction from my initial price ($2,300,000 to $1,900,000), but still remain well above both my minimum and his current offer. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By framing my counteroffer as an attempt to ""find a middle ground,"" I'm signaling willingness to negotiate further and hopefully incentivize Bob to make a more competitive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher.  

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation stalling."
