"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $15500. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16750. This price still reflects the value it brings to your business, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",16750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16750 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on the product and my budget, I'm offering $16000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us and allows us to close this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $17000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $17250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",17250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. While $17250 is getting closer, it's still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $16500 as a final compromise.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",16500.0,Bob,6,
