Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,025,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers and land at $962,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly above our minimum.  It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on a nice round number â€“ would you be willing to go to $1,000,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are close to a deal! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we're still slightly under our ideal target, Bob's latest offer of $980,000 is a strong price. It surpasses our minimum significantly and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's a good time to accept."
