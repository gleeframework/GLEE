``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a tempting offer, it's still too far from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a great price, and I respect that. However, $9,500 simply won't work for me. To make this deal happen, I need to be closer to $10,500.  Let's compromise and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $9,500, and I think $9,500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's stance is firm, and he's clearly not willing to budge further. While $9,500 is a decent sum, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident that selling to John for $15,000 is the best course of action in this situation."
