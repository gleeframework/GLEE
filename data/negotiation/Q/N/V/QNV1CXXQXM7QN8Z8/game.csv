"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a great price, and I respect that. However, $9,500 simply won't work for me. To make this deal happen, I need to be closer to $10,500.  Let's compromise and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $9,500, and I think $9,500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $9,500.",9500.0,Bob,6,
