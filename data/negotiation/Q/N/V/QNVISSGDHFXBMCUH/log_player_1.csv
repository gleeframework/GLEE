Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profits.  I'll be willing to negotiate down, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying at a higher price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly less than my minimum, so I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but this is my final offer before I consider selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It looks like Bob is not willing to come up to my price.  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting that offer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a better deal than what Bob is offering."
