Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, there's space to negotiate down towards his perceived value while still remaining above your minimum. 
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes value and confidence, subtly suggesting the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Context:**  If the product is in high demand or there are other potential buyers, a more assertive pricing strategy can be employed."
