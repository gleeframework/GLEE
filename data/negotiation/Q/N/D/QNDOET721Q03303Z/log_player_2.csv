"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's no point in accepting it.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has immense value that goes beyond your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,750,000 is still above my budget, but it's a step in the right direction. I'll counter-offer again, pushing for a price closer to my limit. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to rush into buying from John without exhausting all possibilities with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
