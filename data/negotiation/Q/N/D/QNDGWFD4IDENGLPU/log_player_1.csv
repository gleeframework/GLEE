Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you something you value highly for a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to sell you the product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest price Bob might accept maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows for potential counter-offers while staying above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob strengthens the offer's appeal. 

This approach seeks a win-win while ensuring you surpass the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
