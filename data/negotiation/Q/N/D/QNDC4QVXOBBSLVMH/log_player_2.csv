You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000. There's no point in accepting it.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate a better price or to simply walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice the lowest possible price I'm willing to pay, which is the same price John is offering. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept my offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though it's lower than her initial offer.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still a chance I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from $800,000 to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price. It's a reasonable compromise that might be more appealing to her than risking losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I've already made a counteroffer and she's rejected it. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks the chance that Alice will walk away or I might miss out on getting the product from John.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for $800,000, ensuring I get it within my budget."
