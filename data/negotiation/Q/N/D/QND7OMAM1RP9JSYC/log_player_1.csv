Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob ($1,200,000). 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a one-time offer, Alice creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John for the lower price of $800,000."
