"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $1,100,000 is less than $1,200,000, even though it's more than the product's worth to Alice.
* **Saving money is the goal:**  As Bob, you want to save as much money as possible, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
