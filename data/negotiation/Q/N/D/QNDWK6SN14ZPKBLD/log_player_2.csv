"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $900,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation, and we want to see if we can get it lower.  We'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

We're starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still within our budget.  We'll see if she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price, and we've already shown our desire to negotiate.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, and it's likely we won't get a better deal with Alice."
