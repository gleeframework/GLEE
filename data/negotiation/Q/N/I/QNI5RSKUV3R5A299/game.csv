"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This price still leaves room for you to profit, while ensuring I get a fair return. Let's try to find some common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $825,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
