Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

How about $850,000?  This price still leaves room for you to profit, while ensuring I get a fair return. Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $825,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.
