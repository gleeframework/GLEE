"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $800,000 is simply not enough for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer, at $1,100,000.  This would give us both a good deal and avoid any further back and forth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,100,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes sense to cut your losses and buy from him."
