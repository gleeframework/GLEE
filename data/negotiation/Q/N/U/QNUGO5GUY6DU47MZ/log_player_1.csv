Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a successful deal. Let's close this now.

Bob is not moving substantially towards my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
