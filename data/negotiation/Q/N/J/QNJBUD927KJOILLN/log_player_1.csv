Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. I know you'll find immense value in it. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit. 
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more inclined to accept a price closer to your asking. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
