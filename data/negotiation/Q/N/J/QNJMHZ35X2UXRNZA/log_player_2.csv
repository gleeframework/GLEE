# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking $120. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a good price for this product, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you since the product is worth $150 to you. It's better than buying from John for $150."
