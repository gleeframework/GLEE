Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's a good chunk above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** A positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $120, there's space for Bob to counteroffer and for us to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Avoiding going to John:**  This price is high enough that I'm incentivized to try and get a better deal with Bob than I could with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's shown interest and a willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John for $80 would be the worst outcome.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a good price for this product, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffering within a reasonable range:** My counteroffer of $110 is still above Bob's offer but closer to his price point. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm still using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that the product is good value for the price, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for a final agreement:**  This price still allows for a slight wiggle room in case Bob wants to counter again. 

My goal is to close the deal at this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
