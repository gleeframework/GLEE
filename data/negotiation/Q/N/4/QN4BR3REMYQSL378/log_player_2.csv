{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $900,000. There's room for negotiation. 
* **You want to explore the possibility of a lower price.** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  Only choose this option if you can't get a better deal with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive first counteroffer:** Starting with a lower price sets the tone for negotiation and shows you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Considered Alice's value:**  $750,000 is still a significant profit for Alice, given her value of $800,000.
