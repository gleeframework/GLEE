"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price just for you, Bob! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is a somewhat reasonable price, rejecting Alice's offer opens up the possibility of getting a better deal. You know John is willing to sell it for $120, so you haven't lost the opportunity to buy."
