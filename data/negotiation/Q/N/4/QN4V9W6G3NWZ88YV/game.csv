"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is far below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
