"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm open to offers, but my starting price is $150. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal!",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $112.50.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",112.5,Bob,6,
