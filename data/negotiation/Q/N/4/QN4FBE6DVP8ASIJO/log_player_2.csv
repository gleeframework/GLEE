"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high ($1,200,000) compared to your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still significantly over your budget.  It's worth rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to negotiate further before buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still out of your budget, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, the price of $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than your budget.  You've already rejected two counteroffers and made your own counteroffers, showing your commitment to a fair deal. However, at this point, it's more beneficial to move on. You can secure the product from John for a significantly lower price at $800,000.  This ensures you stay within your budget and avoid further negotiation."
