Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While we could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** We're securing a $50,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the potential of getting a lower offer later. 
* **John as Backup:** We always have John as a fallback option at $800,000 if negotiations with Bob completely fail."
