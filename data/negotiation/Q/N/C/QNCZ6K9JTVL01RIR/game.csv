"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I think that's a fair price considering its value and our current market conditions.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand the current market conditions.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9250 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  How about we meet at $9000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
