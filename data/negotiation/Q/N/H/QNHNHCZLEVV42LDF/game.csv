"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I do see value in this product,  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
