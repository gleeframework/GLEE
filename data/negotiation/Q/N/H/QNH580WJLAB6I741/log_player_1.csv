I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not willing to accept it at this point.  I believe the product is worth more than $100 and I'm going to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $120. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it will be acceptable to Bob."

Bob seems unwilling to negotiate further, and I'm not willing to drop my price any lower than $100.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $100."
