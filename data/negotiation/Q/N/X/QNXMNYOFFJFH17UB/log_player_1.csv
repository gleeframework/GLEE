"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both our valuations leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will reveal how aggressively I can negotiate.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. I won't settle for anything less, ensuring a profitable outcome regardless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects its potential while also allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe there's room for negotiation.  His message indicates strong interest, and I'm willing to bargain to secure a better deal. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I value this product highly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  I've come down significantly from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to make a deal. However, the substantial decrease is justified by emphasizing the product's inherent value.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  $1,500,000 represents a healthy profit margin while remaining potentially attractive to Bob. It splits the difference between his offer and my previous price, encouraging a sense of compromise. 
* **Maintaining Control:** I'm still in a strong negotiating position. If Bob rejects this offer, I can gauge his seriousness and decide whether to push further or consider John's offer more seriously as we progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly holding firm at $1,200,000, indicating this is likely his upper limit. However, I'm not willing to concede that much ground just yet. I'll make one more strategic counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be sure this deal truly reflects the value of what I'm offering.  Let's make this our final push - $1,350,000, and we have an agreement.  This is my best and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and seriousness to the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** A $150,000 decrease shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a significant profit above my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Time Constraint:** With half the rounds remaining, I need to apply pressure. This offer encourages Bob to make a decision quickly before I potentially walk away. 
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly stated, the existence of John's offer allows me to confidently hold firm at this price. I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay at this time. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer at $1,300,000 still yields a $300,000 profit over my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Bob and potentially losing the deal altogether. The additional profit I might squeeze out is unlikely to outweigh this risk.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and allows me to move on to other opportunities. The longer the negotiation drags on, the higher the opportunity cost."
