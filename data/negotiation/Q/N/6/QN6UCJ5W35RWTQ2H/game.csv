"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $800,000.  It's a significant investment for me, and I want to ensure it's a good value.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the value of the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $825,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this a really attractive deal for me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.
