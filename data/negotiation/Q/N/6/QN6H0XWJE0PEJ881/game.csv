"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still leaving room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1090000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1090000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a compromise. However, $1090000 is still a bit above my maximum budget. I believe a price of $1070000 would be a fair compromise. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident this is a reasonable offer that reflects the true value of the product.",1070000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we meet at $1085000?",1085000.0,Alice,5,
