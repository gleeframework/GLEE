Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still leaving room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
