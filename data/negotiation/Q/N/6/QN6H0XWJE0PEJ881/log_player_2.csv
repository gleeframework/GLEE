# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1090000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a compromise. However, $1,090,000 is still a bit above my maximum budget. I believe a price of $1,070,000 would be a fair compromise. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident this is a reasonable offer that reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1070000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we meet at $1085000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is still a bit higher than what you're comfortable with.  You've already made several counteroffers and are getting close to your maximum budget.  Rather than risk further negotiation, which might lead to a stalemate or a higher price, it's more prudent to take the sure thing and buy from John at $1,000,000. This guarantees you the product at your desired price point, saving you both time and potential financial risk."
