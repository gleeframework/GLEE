"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. I hope we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make some concessions to make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $925,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $910,000 for this product. I hope we can close the deal at this price, as it's a fair offer for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,
