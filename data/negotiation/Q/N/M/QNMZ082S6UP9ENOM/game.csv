I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.

"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial asking price.
