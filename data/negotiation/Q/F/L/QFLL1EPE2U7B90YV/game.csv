"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a great product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I could do $875,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a significant investment, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $900,000 is tempting, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $880,000?  That's a strong offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $895,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to call it a day at this point.",895000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to go up to $885,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a strong offer, and it saves us both from potentially starting over with someone else.",885000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $885,000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you at $890,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a tough decision, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,9,
