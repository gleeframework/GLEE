Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $950,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $895,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to call it a day at this point.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $885,000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you at $890,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a tough decision, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $890,000.  It's Round 9, and we have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000. It's time to cut our losses and take the sure win."
