"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $112. This is a fair compromise and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  What do you say?",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $112 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $110?  It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
