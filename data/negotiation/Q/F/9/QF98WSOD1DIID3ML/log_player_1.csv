Bob's offer:

```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While he's moving closer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's acceptable to me within the remaining rounds. 

Selling to John guarantees I receive my desired amount and avoids the risk of Bob not meeting my price point before the rounds expire."
