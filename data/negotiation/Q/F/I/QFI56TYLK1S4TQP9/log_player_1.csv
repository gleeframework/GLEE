{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $200 is significantly above your minimum of $150, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **It's not too high:**  A very high price might scare Bob off immediately.  
* **It's friendly:**  A friendly opening message encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.

Let me know what Bob's response is and we'll figure out the next steps!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $170? It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good move:

* **It's a compromise:** It shows Bob you're willing to negotiate while still staying above your minimum.
* **It's still profitable:** $170 is comfortably higher than your minimum of $150.
* **It's encouraging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get. 

Let me know how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John willing to pay $150, so it's worth pushing Bob a little further to see if you can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $140 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $145? It's a fair price for both of us, and you'll get an amazing product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **Compromise:**  It shows Bob you're willing to negotiate while still staying above your minimum.
* **Close to your goal:** $145 is very close to the guaranteed price from John, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes a fair price and the value Bob will get.

Let's see if Bob finally accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut your losses and sell to John.  Bob's offer of $135 is below your minimum acceptable price of $150, and you've already made several counteroffers.  You're guaranteed $150 from John, so that's the best course of action."
