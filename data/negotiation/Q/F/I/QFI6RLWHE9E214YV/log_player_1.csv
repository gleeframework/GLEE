"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $115, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value.  This gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum price of $100. I'm willing to accept it and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
