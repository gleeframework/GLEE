"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'll offer it to you for $125. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
