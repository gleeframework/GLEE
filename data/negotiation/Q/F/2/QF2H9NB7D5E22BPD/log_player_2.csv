You have three options:

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Although Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He's better off trying to negotiate further."
