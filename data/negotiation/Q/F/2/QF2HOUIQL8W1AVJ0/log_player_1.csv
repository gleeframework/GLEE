Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value gives you the best chance of securing the sale while still making a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at the special price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Positioning:** The message highlights the product's exclusivity and value.
* **Price:** The $1,150,000 price point gives Bob a $50,000 discount (incentivizing him to buy), while still netting you a $150,000 profit over your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Framing the price around ""fairness"" and ""return on investment""  can make it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance."
