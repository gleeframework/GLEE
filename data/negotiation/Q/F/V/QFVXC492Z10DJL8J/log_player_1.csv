"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This should give me a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in the product and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more favorable price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,000 is too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves you with a fair price for a valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe $8,000 is still a reasonable price for the product considering its value. I would like to stick to this figure. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer, which is far below my minimum value of $12,000.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and there's a good chance we won't reach an agreement.  With John offering a guaranteed $12,000, it's a more sensible choice to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
