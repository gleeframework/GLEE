Round 5

}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $99. I'm willing to meet you at $101.50, and that's my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we're getting very close to my maximum price. While I could try to haggle further, there's a risk Alice will increase her price or I'll run out of rounds. Accepting $101.50 guarantees a decent price and avoids the risk of paying John's higher price."
