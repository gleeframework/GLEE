Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth a significant amount and you're offering it to him before a public listing, you're creating a sense of value and exclusivity.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we aim high,  $150 is still a reasonable markup that Bob might accept, considering the product is worth $100 to him. If he rejects the offer, we have John as a backup to buy it at our minimum price."
