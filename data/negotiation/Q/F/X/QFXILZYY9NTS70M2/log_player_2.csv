Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $7,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $7,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price from John rather than risk Alice not budging any further."
