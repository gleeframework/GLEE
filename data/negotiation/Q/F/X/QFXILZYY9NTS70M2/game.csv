"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $7,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,5,
