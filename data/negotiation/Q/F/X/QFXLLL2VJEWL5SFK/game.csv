"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the value, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,750,000. This offer represents a significant investment on your part but is in line with the value you'll gain.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,650,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value I'll gain from the product. Can you consider my offer?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
