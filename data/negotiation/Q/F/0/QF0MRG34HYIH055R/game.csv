"Alice, that's a great price, but unfortunately I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, would you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",10000.0,Bob,4,
