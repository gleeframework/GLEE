"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to you.  While I'm confident it's worth more than $1,200,000 to you, I'm willing to sell it for $1,100,000. This price represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to achieve a favorable outcome.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I have a backup buyer who is ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. ",1100000.0,Alice,1,
