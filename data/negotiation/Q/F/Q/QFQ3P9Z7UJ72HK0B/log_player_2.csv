"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's above my maximum budget and doesn't leave any room for negotiation.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, but I'm not going to go any higher.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that makes sense for both of us.  This initial counteroffer allows for some room to negotiate. My maximum budget is $1,000,000, but I'm starting a bit higher to give us room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To be fair, I can come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. Although she lowered it,  $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'll reject and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,350,000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going up slightly from my previous offer but still keeping it below Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I won't be pushed too far. My goal is to meet in the middle, especially considering the product's value. If Alice accepts, it's a win for both of us."
