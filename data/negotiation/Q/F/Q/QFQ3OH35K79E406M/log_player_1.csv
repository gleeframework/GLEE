"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal for both of us, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This allows room for negotiation, while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good price, I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $95? This is a fair price for both of us and helps me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $95. This is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. I'm also using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a higher price.  It's better to accept and secure a sale than continue negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
