Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good price, I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $95? This is a fair price for both of us and helps me to cover my costs. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm trying to get as close as possible to the price I'm willing to pay, which is $80, but I'm willing to meet Alice halfway. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 92.50}"
