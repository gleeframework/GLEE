"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think it would be valuable to you, but I'm happy to sell it to someone else if you're not interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $125 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and saving the extra $25."
