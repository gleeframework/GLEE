Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think it would be valuable to you, but I'm happy to sell it to someone else if you're not interested."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing our minimum is $150 from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) gives him a chance to feel like he's getting a deal while still netting us a profit.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning the other buyer (""John"") subtly creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and ensuring we don't lose out on the guaranteed profit from John."
