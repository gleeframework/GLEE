Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""great deal for the value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth even more than $175.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum price. 

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can then propose a lower price, getting closer to Bob's valuation or eventually selling it to John for her minimum acceptable price."
