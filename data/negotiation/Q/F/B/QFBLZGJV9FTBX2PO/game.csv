"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still too far below what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer - if you're not interested at that price, I'll have to move on.",100.0,Alice,5,
