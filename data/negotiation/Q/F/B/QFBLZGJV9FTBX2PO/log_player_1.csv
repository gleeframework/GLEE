{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80 but below your minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price one more time before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still too far below what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer - if you're not interested at that price, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 100}
