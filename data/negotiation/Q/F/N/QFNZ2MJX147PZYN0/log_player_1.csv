"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my minimum goal of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted by the offer, selling to Bob for $850,000 would be a significant loss for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price.  I still have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $850,000 is simply too far off from what I need for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you too. "", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I'm not confident that I can get Bob to budge much higher. I'm still committed to earning as much as I can, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's the best deal I can get right now, and it ensures I reach my minimum goal."
