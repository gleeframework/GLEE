"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This price reflects the value it brings while still being a good deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Bob,4,
