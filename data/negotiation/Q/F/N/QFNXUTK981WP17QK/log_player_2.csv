"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This price reflects the value it brings while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
