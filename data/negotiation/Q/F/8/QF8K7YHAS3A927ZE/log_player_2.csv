"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $120, which is still within your budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer at $115 allows you to potentially get a better deal later, or at least ensures you stay within your budget."
