Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $1,100,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This allows me to accept a counteroffer without losing too much.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the benefits to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, which is necessary to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed option:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a price that undervalues my product.
* **Positive framing:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product for Bob.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is direct and easy to understand.
* **Pressure to accept:** I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept the offer by suggesting it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is only slightly higher than his initial offer, and it's still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** If negotiations with Bob break down, I have the guaranteed option of selling to John for $1,200,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This price is right at the edge of my acceptable range, and it would allow us to complete this transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my previous offer of $1,050,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that $1,000,000 is at the ""edge of my acceptable range"" to signal that I'm really pushing the limits to make a deal. 
* **Maintaining firm stance:**  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000, but I'm still presenting the offer as a way to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Open to discussion:** The message ends with an invitation for Bob to discuss further, keeping the door open for a potential agreement."
