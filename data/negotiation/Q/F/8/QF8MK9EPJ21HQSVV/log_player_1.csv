{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to consider your product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $925000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept $875,000, I believe I can still get a better deal. We've only had four rounds, and I want to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to be fair. However, $875,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's make one last attempt to find common ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000 again, as I feel it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob seems unwilling to budge above $875,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $900,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to negotiate a better price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000.  While it's not ideal, it's better than getting stuck in a negotiation that's not going anywhere."
