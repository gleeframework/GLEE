"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to consider your product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $850000 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $925000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to be fair. However, $875000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's make one last attempt to find common ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $900000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000 again, as I feel it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,
