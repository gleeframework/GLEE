Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $15,000. It's a fantastic deal and I know you'll be very happy with it."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn the most money. Since John provides a ""safety net"" at $12,000, Alice should aim higher with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $15,000 represents a 25% markup, which is a significant increase but not necessarily outlandish depending on the product. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he finds the price too high. Alice can then decide whether to lower the price slightly or stick to John's guaranteed offer. 

**Important Note:** The success of this strategy depends heavily on the product and whether a $3,000 markup is realistic for the market."
