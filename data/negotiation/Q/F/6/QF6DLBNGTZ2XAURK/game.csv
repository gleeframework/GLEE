"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $110 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your target price, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one last compromise at $140. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",140.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not budging from my previous offer, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm sticking with my final offer of $140. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",140.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not budging, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $100. If you're willing to meet me at $130, I'll reconsider and buy from you. Otherwise, I'll have to say goodbye.",130.0,Bob,10,
