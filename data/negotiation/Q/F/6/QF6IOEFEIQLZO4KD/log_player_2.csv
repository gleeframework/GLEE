"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize savings:**  The $10,000 offer is a considerable discount from Alice's initial price and is well within Bob's budget.
* **Test the waters:**  This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and provide an initial benchmark for future rounds.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  There is still room for both parties to move towards a mutually agreeable price in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $14,000 and is a reasonable compromise.  Bob is still able to secure a good deal while saving money compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation and ensures a quick and efficient transaction."
