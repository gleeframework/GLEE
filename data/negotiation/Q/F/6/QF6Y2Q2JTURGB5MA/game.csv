"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $950000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to ensure I receive fair value for this unique product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This offer reflects a significant price adjustment while still allowing me to achieve my desired return. I'm confident this is a win-win proposition for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
