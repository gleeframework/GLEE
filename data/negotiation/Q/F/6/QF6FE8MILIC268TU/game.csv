"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is your budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
