"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I believe there's room for compromise, and this gives us a starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe I can still get a better deal, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, which might encourage Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is consistently offering significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I've already made concessions, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement with more rounds. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing out on that guaranteed amount."
