"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and get this done.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,6,
