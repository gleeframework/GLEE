"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a good price, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate further.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for potential further savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but it establishes a lower starting point for the negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter, but I'm aiming to push the price down as much as possible within the 10 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get the price down closer to my initial counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,200 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a lower price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get Alice to budge further.  I have 5 rounds left, so there's time to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, closing the gap between my offer and Alice's. I'm hoping that this shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but still seeking a better deal.  If Alice rejects again, I'll need to reassess my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,100 is now very close to my desired price range. With only three rounds left, it's unlikely I can get a much lower price from Alice.  It's a good deal, and accepting it ensures I get the product within my budget.  There's a chance Alice will lower the price further in the next round, but the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially ending the negotiation is too high."
