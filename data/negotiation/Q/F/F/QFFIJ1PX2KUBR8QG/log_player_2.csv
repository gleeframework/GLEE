"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1000000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with incredible potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. There's a strong possibility that you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for a more favorable outcome.
* **Justified Offer:** I've included a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing my budget and the product's potential to make the price seem reasonable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to go up in price if Alice counters, but I've given her a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and has a lot of potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  It's a fair price that recognizes both your budget and the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial offer, but it's still above my preferred price point. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get her closer to my preferred price of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential and my budget limitations. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I've only increased my offer by $50,000, showing that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Finality:** I've stated that this is my ""final offer,"" adding pressure to Alice.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning ""other options""  (buying from John) subtly reminds Alice of the potential lost opportunity."
