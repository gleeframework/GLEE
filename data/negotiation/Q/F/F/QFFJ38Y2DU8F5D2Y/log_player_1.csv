{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) but still offers him a potential profit if he finds a way to leverage the product for more than his initial valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message doesn't completely shut down the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly lower offer, keeping a small window open for further discussion."
