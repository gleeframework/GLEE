Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly,"" Alice implies the product might be desired by others, potentially driving up the perceived value for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's still very profitable for Alice (and possibly acceptable to Bob).

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price point that's beneficial for her, knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John."
