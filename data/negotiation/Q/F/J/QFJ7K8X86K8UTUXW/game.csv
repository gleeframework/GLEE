"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $130? It's right in the middle of our last two offers.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $132? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",132.0,Alice,5,
