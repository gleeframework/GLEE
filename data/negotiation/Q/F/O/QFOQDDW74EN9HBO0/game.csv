"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? This would be a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
