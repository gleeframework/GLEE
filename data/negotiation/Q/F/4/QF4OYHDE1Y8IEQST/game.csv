"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $1,150,000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still leaving you with a significant profit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,090,000?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,090,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,080,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
