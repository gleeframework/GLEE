Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer price allows room for negotiation and increases the chance of securing a higher profit. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of settling above your minimum price of $15,000.
* **Value Justification:** While the initial offer is above Bob's perceived value, the message subtly emphasizes the product's worth to Bob. This can potentially nudge his perception and justify the higher price. 
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This safety net allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a bit of negotiation. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy for reaching a mutually agreeable price."
