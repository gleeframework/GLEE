"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, but also allows me to potentially get a higher price if Bob is willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum threshold of $80, and I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is still above my minimum threshold, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm rejecting the offer and will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm counteroffering with $82. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum threshold. It's also a price that could be a compromise for Bob, considering he's already offered $75."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $80. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, but with only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, ensuring I don't lose any money."
