"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its potential benefits for you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still beneficial for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the costs and potential of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise that allows us to both achieve our goals. Let's close this deal with this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the mutual benefits we'll both gain from this deal.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $975,000, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.",950000.0,Bob,8,
