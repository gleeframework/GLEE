"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still outside my budget. Could you do $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $90 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stay under $80. Would you be willing to do $75? That's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. $90 was my last offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. I'm not willing to go below $85, that's the lowest I can go.",85.0,Alice,7,
