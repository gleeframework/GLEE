Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've gone as low as I can, Bob. $90 was my last offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. I'm not willing to go below $85, that's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $85, and has indicated she won't go lower. While closer to my target, it's still above my $80 maximum. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, making it the more financially sound choice at this point."
