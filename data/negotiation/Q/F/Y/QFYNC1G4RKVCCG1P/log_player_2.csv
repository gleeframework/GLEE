"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. While I value this product at no less than $1200000, I believe its potential value to you could be even greater.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $1,500,000, which is above my budget of $1,000,000. I'll also consider that Alice values the product at no less than $1,200,000, so it's likely that I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'll reject the offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
