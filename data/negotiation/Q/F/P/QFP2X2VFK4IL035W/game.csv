"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $6000 is a lower price, I'm not ready to go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $8000? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's keep this conversation going.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $5500? I think that's a fair price for a product of this quality.",5500.0,Bob,4,
