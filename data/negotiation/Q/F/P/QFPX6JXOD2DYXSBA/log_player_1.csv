Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be more assertive in your pricing with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always adjust your price downwards during the negotiation process, but you can't go back up from your initial offer."
