"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  That's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
