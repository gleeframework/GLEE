"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  Offering $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's halfway between Alice's offer and his maximum price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still giving Bob a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. He's better off continuing to negotiate and seeing if he can get Alice to lower the price further. There are still several rounds left, so Bob has time to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate and trying to close the gap between his desired price and Alice's. This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous one, demonstrating that he's willing to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. It's a reasonable amount that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to the price John is offering.  There's no incentive for Bob to continue negotiating, as he won't get a better price from Alice.  Buying from John is a guaranteed deal at a price Bob is already willing to pay.  It's better to close the deal and avoid the risk of further rounds of negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
