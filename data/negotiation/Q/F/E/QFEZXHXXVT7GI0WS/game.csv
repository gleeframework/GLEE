,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still think $13,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
