"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
