"Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is significantly below the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
