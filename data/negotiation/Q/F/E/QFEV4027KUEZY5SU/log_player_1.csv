"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a great price. How does $120 sound?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves me a decent profit. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it holds for me. Could we discuss a price closer to my valuation of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I want to try and get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my valuation and our previous discussions, could we aim for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$100 is a good price, and we're already halfway through the rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, especially since John is only offering $80."
