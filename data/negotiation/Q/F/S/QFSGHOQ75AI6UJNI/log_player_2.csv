It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a better alternative with John at $10,000."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000.  This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum.  You can potentially negotiate a better price, or go with John for a guaranteed $10,000."

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500. This is a compromise, closer to Alice's last offer but still below my maximum.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while keeping the price within my budget."
