Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'll be watching closely for his response and adjust my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is my minimum value, and I'm willing to accept this price if Bob agrees. However, if he rejects again, I will be forced to sell to John at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum value.  I'm not willing to accept that, and I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation that could result in an even lower price. Selling to John for $12,000 is the most sensible option at this point."
