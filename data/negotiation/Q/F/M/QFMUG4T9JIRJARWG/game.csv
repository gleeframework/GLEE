"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $15000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $17500 if you're serious about this. It's a fair compromise considering the value I know this product holds. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
