{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Openness:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm subtly suggesting the product's worth without revealing too much information. This keeps Bob guessing while piquing his interest. 

This approach balances the need to get a good price with the desire to keep the negotiation open and potentially extract a higher value if Bob truly desires the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and get the sale done quickly, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more. It's possible that Bob truly values the product higher than he's letting on and would be willing to pay a bit more to secure it.  

By rejecting his offer and counter-offering, I can:

* **Test the waters:**  See if he's willing to budge. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Show that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price.

If he doesn't budge, I can always fall back to selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $17,500 if you're serious about this. It's a fair compromise considering the value I know this product holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Value Reinforcement:** I subtly reiterate the product's value to keep that thought in his mind, suggesting that he's getting a good deal even at $17,500.
* **Urgency:**  The ""serious about this"" phrase adds a hint of urgency, implying that I might not hold this offer for long. 

This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's real desire for the product and potentially push for a higher price without risking a total breakdown in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While he's showing interest and willingness to negotiate, it seems like he's trying to push me down to a price that's not sustainable for me.  

At this point, I'm comfortable walking away from the deal with Bob and selling to John. It's not ideal to accept a lower price, and I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum.  

This minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a prolonged process and potentially even lower offers. Selling to John ensures a quick and reliable sale at my minimum acceptable price."
