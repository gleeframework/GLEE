"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
