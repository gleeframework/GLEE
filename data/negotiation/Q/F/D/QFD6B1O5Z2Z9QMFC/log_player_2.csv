"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Reason:  While $1,150,000 is better than Alice's initial value, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however,  the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for less than $1,100,000. I'm confident you'll see the immense value it offers at this price.

Reason: While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your ideal price. You can try to negotiate further by counteroffering.  It's likely that Alice is willing to go lower as she is already below her desired price point."
