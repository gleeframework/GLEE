"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however,  the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for less than $1,100,000. I'm confident you'll see the immense value it offers at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This would give us both a good deal and ensure a smooth transaction.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
