"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.**  By rejecting, you open the door to potentially lower the price further and save money. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always purchase from John, but it's the most expensive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for potential compromise.
* **A clear message:**  The message emphasizes your desire for a fair deal and sets the stage for further negotiation.
* **Potential for saving:** This counteroffer has the potential to save you $100,000 compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,300,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident that the true potential of this product warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable:** While still a bit above your ideal price, it's a significant drop from her initial offer and closer to your initial counter-offer.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth it:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially save you another $50,000, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and you having to buy from John for a higher price is too high.
* **Saving is a priority:** Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you'll purchase the product for $150,000 less than John's price, securing a significant saving."
