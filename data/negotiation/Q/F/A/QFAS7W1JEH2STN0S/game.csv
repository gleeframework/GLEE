"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!",90.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75. How about we try $82.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle between $82.50 and $78? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $80.25. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",80.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $80.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $79.50, and that's my final offer. If you can accept that, I'd be happy to make a purchase.",79.5,Bob,6,
