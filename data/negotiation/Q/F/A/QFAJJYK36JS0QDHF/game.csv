"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe $950,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not sure if $775,000 is enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle at $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous counteroffer of $825,000.
