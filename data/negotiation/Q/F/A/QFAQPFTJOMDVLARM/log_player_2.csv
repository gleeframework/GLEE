"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate with Alice. Even if we end up buying from John for $10,000, we still gain information about Alice's willingness to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant discount (20%) shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and  I'm willing to pay less than her initial price. This is a good starting point to see if she's open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice and allows me to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise.  This also allows me to see how much further Alice is willing to move down in price."
