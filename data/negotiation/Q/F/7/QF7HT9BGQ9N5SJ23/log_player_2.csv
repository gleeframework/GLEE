"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. Let me know what you think! If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is only slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, he can get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to get the product at a lower price."
