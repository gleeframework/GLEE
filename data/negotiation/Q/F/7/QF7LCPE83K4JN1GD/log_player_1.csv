"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,500,000, significantly above my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal even if he gets a discount.
* **Positive message:** The message is upbeat and emphasizes the product's value and potential for Bob. This helps create a good initial impression. 
* **No immediate threats:** I avoid mentioning John or a time limit in the first round to keep Bob focused on negotiating with me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  While I'm happy to sell for $1,200,000, I'm not desperate. I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's initial offer is low, but I believe I can negotiate a higher price. I have 8 rounds left to explore that possibility.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control and shows I'm not afraid to walk away.  This might encourage him to offer more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to see a slightly higher offer to reflect the true value of this product. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my bargaining position.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.  This keeps the focus on the product's worth rather than just haggling. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the conversation constructive and avoids escalating the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Bob has moved up from his initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,250,000. This is a good increase and a positive sign he's willing to compromise.
* **Limited time:**  We are only on Round 4, meaning we have 6 rounds left.  While I could try for a bit more, the risk of him walking away entirely is increasing.
* **Securing the deal:**  $1,250,000 is a good price, and accepting now ensures I don't risk losing the deal altogether. This is especially important since I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I get a good price without risking more rounds of negotiation."
