"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, given its value to me.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. This still reflects its value while being more accessible for you. Please let me know if this offer suits you better.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $110, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I've considered your position carefully, and I would like to propose a final price of $115 for the product. This is my best offer, reflecting both the value of the product and your interest in it. I hope this aligns with your budget. Please let me know if this works for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
