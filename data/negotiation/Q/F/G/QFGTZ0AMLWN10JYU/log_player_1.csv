"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but if he's not, I can gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the next rounds.  It's important to be ambitious in the first offer, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my initial asking price and I'm hoping to get closer to it.  I'm also confident that I can potentially get a better offer from Bob in the next few rounds, or at least get a better sense of his true value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm decreasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer.  I want to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I also want to ensure I'm getting a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, we'll continue to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit below where I'd like to be. Since I have a few more rounds, I'm hoping I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation doesn't lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again adjusting my offer slightly lower, but still higher than Bob's last offer. I believe this shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept, but if not, I'll continue to assess his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's also worth considering that John is a guaranteed sale for $10,000, making accepting Bob's offer of $11,000 a more attractive option. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
