I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm being optimistic and hoping for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that is still higher than Bob's value but closer to my minimum price, giving him a chance to meet me halfway. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to make the price seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
