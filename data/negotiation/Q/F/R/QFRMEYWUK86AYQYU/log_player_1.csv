"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can get closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a significant gain and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than $1,300,000 right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still not quite in the right range for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firm on his final offer of $1,200,000.  While this is my minimum acceptable price, I have only 4 rounds remaining. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and ending up with nothing.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, so I'm going to sell to him now and secure the deal."
