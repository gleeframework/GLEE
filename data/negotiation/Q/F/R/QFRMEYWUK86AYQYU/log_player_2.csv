Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a significant gain and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still not quite in the right range for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you say?
