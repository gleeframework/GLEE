"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm ready to pay $1100000 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering the value I'm placing on it and my budget limitations.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to pay $1100000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is a fair offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm ready to pay $1200000, which is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
