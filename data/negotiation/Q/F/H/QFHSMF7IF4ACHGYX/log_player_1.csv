Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can aim high with Bob. Starting at $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit even if he negotiates down.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to justify the high price, without revealing my bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is positive and invites Bob's input, making it clear I'm open to discussion and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for negotiation."
