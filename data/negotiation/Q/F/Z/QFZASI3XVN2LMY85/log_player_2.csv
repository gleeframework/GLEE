"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for a lower price.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

Bob should start by offering the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is the same price John is offering. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can still get the product from John for a lower price. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

Bob should offer a price closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget. By increasing the offer from $1,500,000, Bob shows he is serious about negotiating and willing to pay a bit more.  He's also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it is higher than John's price, it is still within Bob's budget.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price, and Bob risks losing the deal to another buyer. It's a good compromise, considering the product's value to Alice is unknown."
