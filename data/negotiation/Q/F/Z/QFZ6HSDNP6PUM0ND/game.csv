"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I know I can buy it from John for $1,000,000.",800000.0,Bob,6,
