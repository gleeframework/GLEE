Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm eager to see it put to good use."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Potential Value:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Aiming higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much larger profit.
* **Confident Positioning:**  Framing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the product's ""value"" can encourage Bob to perceive a higher intrinsic worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is risk-averse, a very high offer might scare him off.  
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price will help you in this process."
