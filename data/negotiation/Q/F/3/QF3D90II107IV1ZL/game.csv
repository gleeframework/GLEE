"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,062,500 still doesn't quite reach my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,070,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a solid deal that allows me to meet my goals. What do you say?",1070000.0,Alice,7,
