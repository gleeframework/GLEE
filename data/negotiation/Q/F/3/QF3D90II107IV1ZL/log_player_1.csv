"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is still below my minimum price, and I think I can get a better deal from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,075,000. How about $1,062,500?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,062,500, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since we've already narrowed the gap considerably."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,062,500 still doesn't quite reach my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,070,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a solid deal that allows me to meet my goals. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1070000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the negotiations have stalled, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing out completely."
