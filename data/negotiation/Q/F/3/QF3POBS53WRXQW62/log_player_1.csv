"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am only able to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  I'll see if I can get closer to that number with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. Would you consider $925,000 for the product? This is the highest I can go while still being within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiations to try to get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm starting to get impatient, $935,000 is still significantly below my desired price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's split the difference on our last offers and agree on $937,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $932,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $932,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer still significantly below my desired price, I've decided to stop negotiating and sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I would have liked to make a deal with Bob, it's clear we're too far apart on price.  It's better to secure the full value of the product now rather than risk getting a lower offer in the final rounds."
