"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the product's quality and potential, while giving you a great deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $850,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think I can go any higher than this.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to drop my price to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's a win-win situation. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000, so I'm thinking $825,000 is a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Bob,6,
