Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Is this a more reasonable price for you?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend."",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $8,000 is below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for that amount. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final counteroffer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000. It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid potentially wasting more rounds of negotiation."
