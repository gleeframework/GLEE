"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Is this a more reasonable price for you?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $8,000 is below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for that amount. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final counteroffer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
