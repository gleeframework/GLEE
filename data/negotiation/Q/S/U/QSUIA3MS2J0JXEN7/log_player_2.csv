"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. He should aim for a lower price, ideally closer to his $120 maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a negotiation and see if he can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to spend closer to $110 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if I can make this more attractive for you. How about I offer the product for $112? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice getting frustrated and sticking to her original price is high. Accepting the $112 offer secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
