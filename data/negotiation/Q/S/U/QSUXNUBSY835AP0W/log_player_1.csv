Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, I have done some research and  $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $12,250?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $12,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little too high for my budget.  Could you do $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $11,000 is a strong deal.  It's significantly more than my backup offer from John and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
