# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, which is a great deal considering its true value to you is $1500000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $1000000 is a fair price, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering its value to you is $1500000.

# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000.

I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000, and I'm not sure I want to continue negotiating with her if she's not willing to budge. I think I'll choose to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. At least I'll be getting the product and I won't have to deal with any more back-and-forth with Alice.
