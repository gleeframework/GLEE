Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fantastic deal"" to entice Bob.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
