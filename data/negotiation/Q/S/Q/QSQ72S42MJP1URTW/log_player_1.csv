Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum ($100). This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to maneuver. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $95, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I've also included a message explaining my reasoning and showing a willingness to compromise. This should encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like we're far apart in our valuations.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
