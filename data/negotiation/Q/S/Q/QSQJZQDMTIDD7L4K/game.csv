"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about offering the product for $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. What do you think?"
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $12500. I'm still thinking $14000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet at $13250?"
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we settle on $13750? It's a bit higher than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",13750.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $13250, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think that's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,,

"I've made it clear that $13250 is my bottom line, Bob. I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you're interested in the product, that's the price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",13250.0,Alice,9,,
