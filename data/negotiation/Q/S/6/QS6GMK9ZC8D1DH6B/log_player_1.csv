"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, I'm subtly reinforcing its worth without directly stating my bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Using phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point for negotiation"" signals that I'm willing to have a conversation and potentially adjust my price.

This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's position while aiming for a high initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his initial perceived value, it's still considerably below my starting price and minimum acceptable value. I have room to negotiate further and will aim to guide the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While we're not quite aligned yet, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. To move things forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,950,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows me to make a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) to signal that my price is firming up but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reinforcing the product's value by stating it ""reflects the product's true value.""
* **Compromise Language:** By using phrases like ""solution that works for both of us"" and ""reasonable compromise,"" I'm maintaining a collaborative and positive tone.

I believe this counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob while demonstrating my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,875,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating his strong interest in the product. However, $1,875,000 is still significantly below my target. I'm willing to push the negotiation further as I believe Bob has more room to move. I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see you're serious about this purchase.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,925,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession, Firmer Tone:** I'm reducing my concession to $25,000, signaling that I'm reaching my limit. The language ""fair and final offer"" adds weight to this round.
* **Acknowledging Bob's Interest:** I recognize Bob's commitment to the negotiation, which helps maintain a positive rapport even as I hold firm on the price.
* **Focus on ""Bridging the Gap"":** This phrasing emphasizes finding a solution together, encouraging Bob to make a similar effort in his next offer. 

This approach balances firmness with a collaborative spirit, aiming to nudge Bob closer to my target price without derailing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your position and appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. Based on our previous negotiations, I would like to propose an offer of $1,900,000. This still falls within my budget and represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a strong price and demonstrates significant movement on his part. While it's slightly below my initial target, it's substantially higher than both his perceived value and my guaranteed sale price with John. Accepting this offer secures a very favorable outcome for me. 

Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Given the progress made and the attractive price point, accepting now is the most strategically sound decision."
