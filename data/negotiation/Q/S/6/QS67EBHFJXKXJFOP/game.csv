"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best offer so far, but I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise, don't you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,050,000. I can offer it to you for $1,037,500. This is my last compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
