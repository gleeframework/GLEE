"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $250?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit high for you, Bob, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $125. This would give you a better price than John, and I'd be happy to make the purchase.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $175, which is $25 more than your last offer. How about we discuss a price of $150?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going above $125. If you're willing to accept that, I'll make the purchase. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
