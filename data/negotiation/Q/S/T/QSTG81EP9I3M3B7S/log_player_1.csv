Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm going to try to get a little more. I believe the product is worth more to him than $800,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. Hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to accept, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
