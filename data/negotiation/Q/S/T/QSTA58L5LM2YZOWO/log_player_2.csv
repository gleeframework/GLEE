"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and get a better price. You can likely get it for less than $90, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $90 is a bit high for me. How about $80? Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $87. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $87 is better than $90, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get it for lower than that. Continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $85.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $86. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now at $86, which is close to your target price of $85. It's a good deal, and you're likely to save more money by buying from Alice than from John."
