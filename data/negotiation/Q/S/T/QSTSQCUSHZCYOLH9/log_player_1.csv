Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500.  It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving room for potential negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's a good value for you given the product's worth.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's worth and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,100. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, $9,100 is still above my minimum.  Further negotiation may take longer and risk losing the sale to John.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point."
