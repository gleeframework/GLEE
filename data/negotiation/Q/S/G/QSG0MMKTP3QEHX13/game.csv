"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to propose a price of $700,000. This would give you a healthy profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. ",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $750,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm willing to go to $725,000. I think this is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's try to close this gap and come to an agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm still eager to make this deal work, but $740,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $730,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",730000.0,Bob,6,
