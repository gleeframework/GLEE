"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is truly significant, and $850,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
