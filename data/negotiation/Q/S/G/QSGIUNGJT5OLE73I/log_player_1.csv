Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also leaving the door open for counteroffers,  encouraging Bob to engage in further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy balances the following:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum desired value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Avoid losing the deal:** I'm not starting too high, to ensure Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer. 
* **Initiate negotiation:**  I'm setting a clear starting point and encouraging Bob to counter-offer, opening the way for potential compromise. 

This approach allows me to leverage both my leverage (the product's value to me) and the possibility of a successful negotiation to secure a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my best offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

**Reasoning:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because:

* **I have a guaranteed alternative:** I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, making Bob's offer less attractive.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to hold out for a higher price and increase my bargaining power in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired value.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing my need for a higher price. I'm also focusing on the potential for reaching a compromise.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding common ground:** By offering a price halfway between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While I'm coming down in price, I'm still above Bob's initial offer, showing that I'm not desperate to sell and have room to negotiate further.
* **Encouraging continued negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion and counteroffers, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is still below my minimum desired value of $1,200,000, it is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer.  Considering Bob's statement that it's his final offer, and the fact that I have a guaranteed alternative of selling to John for $1,200,000, it's likely that further negotiation will not result in a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:**  $925,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offers.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to reject Bob's offers could risk losing the deal altogether, as he might walk away.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While $925,000 is less than what I could get from John, it's still a significant amount of money, and the time and effort involved in further negotiation might not be worth the potential gain.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $925,000 represents a good compromise that balances my desire for a higher price with the potential risk of losing the deal."
