{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it sets a strong anchor point. 
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** By subtly implying the product's high demand (without explicitly mentioning John), we create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.

**Next Steps:**

We will gauge Bob's reaction to this initial offer and adjust our negotiation strategy accordingly. Our ultimate goal remains to secure the highest possible price, capitalizing on the product's value to both potential buyers."
