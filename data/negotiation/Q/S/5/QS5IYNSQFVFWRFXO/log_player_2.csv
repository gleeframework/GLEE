"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value for you. Given its significance and the unique benefits it offers, I am confident it will meet and exceed your expectations.

I am extending this offer to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between the intrinsic value of the product ($1,500,000) and my goal to ensure a fair return on investment. It represents a compelling proposition that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am here to answer any questions or address concerns you might have about the product or the terms of the sale.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
