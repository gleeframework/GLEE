"Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value for you. Given its significance and the unique benefits it offers, I am confident it will meet and exceed your expectations.

I am extending this offer to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between the intrinsic value of the product ($1,500,000) and my goal to ensure a fair return on investment. It represents a compelling proposition that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am here to answer any questions or address concerns you might have about the product or the terms of the sale.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice",1350000.0,Alice,1,
