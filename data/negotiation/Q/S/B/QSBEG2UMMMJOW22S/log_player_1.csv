"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a good profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he should be willing to pay at least this much.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and the number of rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,500 because it's below my minimum of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum price, but closer to what Bob might be willing to pay."
