"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
