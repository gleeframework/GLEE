"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring substantial returns for you. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This feels like a fair deal given the potential this product holds for you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
