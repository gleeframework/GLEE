"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the exclusivity, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $900,000 for the product. We believe this strikes a balance between our valuation and yours. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  I believe this offer reflects its value to me and allows for a fair and mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this negotiation.",875000.0,Bob,4,
