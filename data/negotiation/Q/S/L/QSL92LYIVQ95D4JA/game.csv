"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,750? This is a fair compromise, and it still represents a good deal for you.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,375. This is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",10375.0,Bob,4,
