Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,750? This is a fair compromise, and it still represents a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,375. This is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,375 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer.  It's safer to accept his offer and secure the sale."
