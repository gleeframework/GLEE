"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to engage and start the bargaining process. I'm also highlighting the product's value to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price.  How about $12,500?  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe there's still room for a higher offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to push Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $13,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to my ideal range but still acknowledges Bob's desire for a lower price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and encourage a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little hesitant at $13,000.  I'm feeling very confident that $12,800 is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. With 6 rounds remaining, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a price just above Bob's offer, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try $12,900. This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with $12,900. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it still allows me to maintain a higher price point. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.  This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward without conceding too much."
