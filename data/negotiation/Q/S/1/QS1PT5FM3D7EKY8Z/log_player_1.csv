Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $9,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price of $8,000. 

By starting high but still offering a price that's beneficial to Bob, Alice increases her chances of a successful and profitable sale."
