Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $1,250,000 is a fair starting point that allows for negotiation without immediately being rejected.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and encouraging message can help build a good relationship with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and my options: 
* **Counter with a Lower Price:**  If his counteroffer is reasonable, I can lower my price slightly to reach an agreement.
* **Walk Away:** If his counteroffer is too low, I can walk away and sell to John, ensuring a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm hoping to keep the price lower. How about we aim for $1,100,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my desired price than his initial value of $1,000,000, it's still not enough. I'm confident that I can get a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer of $1,250,000. I'll make sure to highlight the value of the product and why my counteroffer is still fair, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,175,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a great deal. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a price that's beneficial for me. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to maintain a good relationship with Bob and encourage him to accept my offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Be Flexible:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to adjust my price again, but I won't go below $1,150,000.
* **Be Ready to Walk Away:** If his counteroffer remains too low, I'll sell to John and ensure my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for your response. I'll try to stay within my budget while still providing a fair price for your product. How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,250,000, I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the agreement with Bob and move forward with the sale."
