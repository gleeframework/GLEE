"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $9,250? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product well worth the price. Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to accept $9,100?  This is a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away happy.",9100.0,Bob,4,
