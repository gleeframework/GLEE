While $1,750,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a more favorable price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I need to weigh the potential of getting a slightly higher price from Bob against the certainty of selling to John for $1,500,000.  I'm not confident I can push Bob much higher, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me a price above my minimum, so it's the safest option."
