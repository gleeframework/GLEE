Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I want to see if we can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $825,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. It's my minimum price, and it saves me further negotiation rounds."
