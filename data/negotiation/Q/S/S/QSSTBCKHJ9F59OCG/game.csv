"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $825,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,4,
