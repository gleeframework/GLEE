"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product from John for $800,000, and Alice's offer is higher than that.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $825,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target price, he can still get a better deal from John for $800,000. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he shouldn't settle for more than he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 800000}
