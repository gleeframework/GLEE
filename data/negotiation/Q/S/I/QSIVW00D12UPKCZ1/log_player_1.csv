I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This leaves a decent margin for Bob while still allowing me to make a significant profit. It's a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum desired profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $11,000. It's a small compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a good profit and leaves room for further negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Bob has come up to $10,500. This is slightly less than my initial counteroffer, but it's still above my minimum desired profit of $8,000.  It's a good deal and I'll accept his offer."
