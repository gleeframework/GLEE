Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for Bob to negotiate down or for you to concede slightly and still make a profit beyond your baseline.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $100, you're subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering it for $120 leaves a $20 potential profit margin. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have your guaranteed $100 from John."
