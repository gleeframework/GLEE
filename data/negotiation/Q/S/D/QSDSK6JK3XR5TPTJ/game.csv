"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price that reflects the value of this product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a considerable compromise on my end.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
