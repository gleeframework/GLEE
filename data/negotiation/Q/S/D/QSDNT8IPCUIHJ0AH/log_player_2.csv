"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as her offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation.  It also signals that I am serious about buying the product but need a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident you'll find this price to be fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, I'm still willing to see if I can negotiate a better price. It's worth another round of counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a significant saving.  By framing it as a ""compromise,"" I hope to appeal to her sense of fairness and reach a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her increasing her price again.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,000,000 price."
