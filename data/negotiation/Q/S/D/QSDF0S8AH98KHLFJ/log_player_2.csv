# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $800,000.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $762,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight adjustment, though. I can meet you halfway between $775,000 and $762,500, which would be $768,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $768,750.

Alice is clearly sticking to a slow descent and is unlikely to go much lower. This offer is a good compromise and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer."
