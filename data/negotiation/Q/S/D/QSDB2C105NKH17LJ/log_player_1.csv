"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $115 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $140. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
