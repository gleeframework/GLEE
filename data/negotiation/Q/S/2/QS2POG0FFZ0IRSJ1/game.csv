"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
