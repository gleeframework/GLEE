"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which is a fair price considering its quality and features."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the quality and features you mentioned. I would like to propose an offer of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $120 matches your minimum acceptable price, you have the opportunity to sell to John for the same amount without further negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer or engaging in further rounds carries the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation failing, leaving you with a less favorable outcome. Selling to John guarantees you your desired profit with no risk."
