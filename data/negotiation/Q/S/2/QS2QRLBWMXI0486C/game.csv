"I appreciate the unique opportunity to own this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price point to ensure the product's value is reflected. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's unique features.",11000.0,Alice,3,
