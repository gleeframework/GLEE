"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 140} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal value but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob has a clear incentive to accept, as he values the product higher, and I'm leaving the door open for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $140.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while also making it clear that I'm not going to give it away for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $128 is only $8 less than my ideal price. It's getting close to the point where it might be better to take what I can get. There's a risk of further negotiations dragging out, and ultimately leading to a lower price or a deal with John."
