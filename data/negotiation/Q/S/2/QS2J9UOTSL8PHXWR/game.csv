"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could make a deal at $1,125,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
