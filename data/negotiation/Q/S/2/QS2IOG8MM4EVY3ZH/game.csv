"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a good deal for both of us - you get a great product at a fair price, and I can still cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my limits. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $10500 to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $10000, and I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
