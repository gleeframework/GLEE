"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a reasonable compromise considering its value to me is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further. There are still plenty of rounds remaining, and Bob can always buy from John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair compromise between our positions."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $15000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to reduce her price, $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. Bob has time and can always purchase from John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair offer considering its value to me and would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10750. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $15000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still too high for Bob.  At this point, Bob has tried several counteroffers and Alice has been unwilling to budge significantly.  With only a few rounds left, the likelihood of getting a better price is low. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
