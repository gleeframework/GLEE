"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to accept a price closer to my desired range.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm rejecting it and will counteroffer in the next round. I need to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can come to an agreement.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I'm rejecting it and will counteroffer in the next round. I'm running out of time, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will entice Bob to accept. I'm running out of time, and John is always a viable option, but I'd rather sell to Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John. I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are not getting closer to my desired price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk a lower price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
