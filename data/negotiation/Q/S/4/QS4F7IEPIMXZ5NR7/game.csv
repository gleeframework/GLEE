,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'd like to try to get even closer. Would you be willing to meet me at $98?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's compromise at $102.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it's closer to your budget.  What do you say?",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one final offer of $99. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100",99.0,Bob,6,
