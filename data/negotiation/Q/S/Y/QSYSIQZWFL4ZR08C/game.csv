"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's agree on $1,100,000, and we have a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we settle this right now at $1,050,000? That's a significant concession on my part and shows how serious I am about getting this done.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $975,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
