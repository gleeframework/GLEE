"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, it gives us a starting point for negotiation. It lets him know I'm serious about selling but also expect a good price.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. I won't settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. Bob's offer suggests he's aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable amount. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's agree on $1,100,000, and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've significantly lowered my price from $1,300,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** By proposing $1,100,000, I'm aiming for a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This positions it as a fair compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:**  My language remains confident and emphasizes the product's value. I want Bob to understand this is a strong offer, but I'm motivated to make a deal.
* **Time Constraint (Implicit):** As we progress through the rounds, the implicit pressure of potentially losing the deal (and me going to John) increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is still below my desired outcome. I believe I can push for a better price without risking the deal entirely. By continuing the negotiation, I apply subtle pressure as we get closer to the final rounds, and Bob risks me walking away to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we settle this right now at $1,050,000? That's a significant concession on my part and shows how serious I am about getting this done."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Compromise:** I've injected a sense of urgency with ""settle this right now"" to encourage Bob to act. I'm also explicitly stating a significant price drop ($50,000) to highlight my compromising position.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $1,050,000 represents another halfway point between our previous offers, reinforcing the idea of a fair negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm negotiating, I continue to avoid language that devalues the product. This reinforces its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the clock is ticking, and the possibility of me selling to John for my minimum acceptable price increases the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $975,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Money:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is clearly showing resistance to going above $1,000,000.
* **Strong Profit:** While not ideal, $975,000 is still a significant profit margin ($175,000 above my minimum). It's better to secure a good deal now than risk it for a potentially insignificant increase.
* **Bob's ""Other Options""**:  Bob mentioning ""other options"" could be a negotiation tactic, or it might be genuine. It's not worth risking the deal at this point to find out. 

By accepting Bob's offer now, I maximize my chances of closing a profitable deal while minimizing the risk of him walking away or stalling until I'm forced to accept my minimum from John."
