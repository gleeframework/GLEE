"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to make a profitable deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price is closer to my initial offer, but still reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a fair deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This price is closer to my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's settle on $975,000. This price acknowledges the product's value to me while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. It's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize this.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your final offer of $975,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to get a better price for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
