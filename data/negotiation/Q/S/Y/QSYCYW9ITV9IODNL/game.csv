"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you, at a significant discount. Let's see if we can close this deal quickly.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This still represents a significant saving for you and gives us both a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  Let's try $887,500. This would be a great deal for you, and would ensure we both walk away happy with the transaction.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $882,500 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to the middle as possible, but I need a bit more wiggle room.",882500.0,Bob,6,
