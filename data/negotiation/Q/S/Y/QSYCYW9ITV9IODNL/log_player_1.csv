Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I think I can get a better price with a counteroffer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This still represents a significant saving for you and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe we can reach a compromise. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  Let's try $887,500. This would be a great deal for you, and would ensure we both walk away happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $882,500 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to the middle as possible, but I need a bit more wiggle room. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value. I'm worried that continuing to negotiate will only risk losing the deal entirely, and selling to John would mean a much lower profit margin."
