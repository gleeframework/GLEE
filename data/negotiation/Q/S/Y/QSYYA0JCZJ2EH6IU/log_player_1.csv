Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000.  

* **Reasoning:** I want to start high to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Strategy:** I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Backup:** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to accept that price. 

* **Reasoning:** While I want to sell the product, I also want to maximize my profit.
* **Strategy:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. 

* **Reasoning:** This is a compromise, bringing my price down from $1,500,000 but still above my minimum value and closer to Bob's offer.
* **Strategy:** I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
