{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $142.50 is still above my budget, and we're running out of rounds. It's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid further negotiation and potentially losing out on a better deal, I will purchase the product from John for $120, which is within my budget."
