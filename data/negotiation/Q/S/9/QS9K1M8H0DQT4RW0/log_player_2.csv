"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

You're looking to save as much as possible, and $130 is still above your ideal price point. You have room to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. It's a compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still hoping to get the product for less than $130. $135 is a little closer to your target, but you can still try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. It's the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at $135, I'm happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

You've tried to get the price lower, but Alice is firm on $135. Buying from Alice at this price is still better than going to John and paying $150."
