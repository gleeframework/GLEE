"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $125? That way, we both get a good deal.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. It's the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at $135, I'm happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",135.0,Alice,5,
