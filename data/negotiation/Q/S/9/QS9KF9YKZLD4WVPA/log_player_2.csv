"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget and leaves you with minimal savings compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John, which is still within your budget."
