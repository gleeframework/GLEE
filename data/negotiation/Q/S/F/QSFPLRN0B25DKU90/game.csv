,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 100. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product, which I think is a fair price for both of us. ",90.0,Bob,4,
