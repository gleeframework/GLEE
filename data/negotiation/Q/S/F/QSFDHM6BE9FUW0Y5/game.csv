"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects a more realistic valuation of the significant benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind, but let's be realistic about the value here. This product is a game-changer, and the return you'll see will far outweigh the initial investment. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but that price is still significantly outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering John is offering me the same product for the same price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
