"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. Rejecting her offer opens the door for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($650,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that you're serious about buying the product.  The message is framed positively and emphasizes fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice met you halfway, but the new price is still higher than John's offer. There's a small margin to negotiate within your budget, so it's worth making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you be open to $700,000? That would be a great spot for me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a reasonable range of both Alice's latest offer and your ideal price. It emphasizes your budget constraints and presents the offer as a ""win"" for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm going to meet you at $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has signaled this is her final offer. At $725,000, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $800,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge that gap, making John the better option now."
