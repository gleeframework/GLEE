"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you be open to $700,000? That would be a great spot for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm going to meet you at $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this point.",725000.0,Alice,5,
