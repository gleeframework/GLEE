Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's high value to Bob.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces the price justification without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he counters, you have room to go down while still securing a significant profit beyond your $800,000 minimum."
