Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, trying to get a higher price from Bob first maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and makes the offer more appealing to Bob. He gets a perceived ""discount"" while I still make a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, the slightly high price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested, potentially leading to a price even closer to my desired amount."
