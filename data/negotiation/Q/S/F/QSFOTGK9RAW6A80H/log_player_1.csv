I'm starting with a high price, as I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe the product has higher value and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go that low.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
