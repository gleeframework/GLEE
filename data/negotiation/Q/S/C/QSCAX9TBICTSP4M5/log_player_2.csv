"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
* **Your Value:** $15,000
* **Alice's Value:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
