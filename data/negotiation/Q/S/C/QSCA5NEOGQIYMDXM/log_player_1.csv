Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe it's a good price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is $100,000 less than my initial offer, and also less than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, as I mentioned earlier.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1150000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we meet at $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is $50,000 less than my previous counteroffer, and still lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

However, I should also consider that selling the product to John for $1,000,000 is now a viable option. I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John.
