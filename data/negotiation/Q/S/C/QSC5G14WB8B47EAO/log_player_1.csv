Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still staying above my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is my initial offer, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to potentially earn even more.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale to John ($120) increases the chance Bob will accept, avoiding the risk of going to the second buyer."
