"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, your starting price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great price considering the product's value and the research I've done on similar sales in the market.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're open to this price, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I was thinking that since you're willing to meet me at $1,500,000, I could offer you a slight discount to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,525,000, which is still a great price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $1,525,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $1,500,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I will have to move on to other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
