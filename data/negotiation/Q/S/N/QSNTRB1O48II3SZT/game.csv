,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. While the product is great, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'd like to offer $875,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $875,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $890,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",915000.0,Alice,7,
