"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, I'm still not able to go down to $800000 at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000?  This would allow me to move forward, and it's a significant investment for you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and your offer is getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there.  Considering the potential value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $875000.
