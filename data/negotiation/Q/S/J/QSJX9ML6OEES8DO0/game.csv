"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $105. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. Let's close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in buying from you, but I'm not willing to go above $100. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you.",100.0,Bob,6,
