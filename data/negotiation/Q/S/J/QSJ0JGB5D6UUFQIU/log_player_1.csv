"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, just below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary while still ensuring a good profit.  I'm hoping to entice Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to see how seriously he's interested in purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping to get closer to that number by continuing negotiations. I'm also confident that I can get a better price from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob to reach a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal.  I'm also aware that selling to John is always an option if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my last offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but still wanting a decent profit. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough to convince Bob to accept and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and Bob isn't getting much closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm concerned that I'm wasting time and might not be able to get a better deal with him.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  This is the best option for me right now, as it guarantees my minimum desired profit and saves me further time in negotiations."
