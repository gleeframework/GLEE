The product is too expensive at $2,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and hopefully will encourage her to negotiate.  I'm willing to go higher, but I want to see how far she's willing to come down."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still asking for too much.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying the product, but still a substantial discount from Alice's current price.  Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to come closer to my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for too much. I'm willing to go higher, but it's still worth negotiating further to see if we can get a better price.  I'm getting close to John's offer, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,400,000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,400,000. This is closer to John's price, but still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer. If this is rejected, I'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm getting closer to my maximum limit with John. To avoid further negotiation and potential time-wasting, I'll buy the product from John for $1,500,000."
