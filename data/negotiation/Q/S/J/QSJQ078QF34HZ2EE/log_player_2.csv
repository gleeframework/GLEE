"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price of $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's significantly lower than her asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation while staying well below your maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I can accept. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down, her price is still higher than John's. You should reject and try to negotiate further, but be ready to buy from John if she doesn't budge much more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could go up to $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to move, but also puts you in a strong position. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, while still leaving room to negotiate before reaching John's price."
