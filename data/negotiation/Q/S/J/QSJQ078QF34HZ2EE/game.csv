"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I can accept. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could go up to $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
