{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but I believe it's a fair starting point.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'm confident in the value of this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a fair value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $12,500 is a good compromise and a significant profit for me.  It's also higher than what John is offering, so it's the best outcome in this situation."
