Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
