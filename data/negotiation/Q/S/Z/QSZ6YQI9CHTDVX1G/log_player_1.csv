Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and sets a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  While $117.50 is closer, I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could we do $110? That's a pretty good offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is just above my minimum desired price of $100, and it's likely the best deal I'll get from him. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
