Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusivity"" and ""unique opportunity"" to justify the high price. This aims to appeal to Bob's potential desire for something special.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob counters, you can gradually lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000."
