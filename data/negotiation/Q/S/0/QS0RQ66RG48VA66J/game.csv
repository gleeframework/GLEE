"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a successful transaction. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,600,000 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a great value for you as well.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,420,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1420000.0,Alice,5,
