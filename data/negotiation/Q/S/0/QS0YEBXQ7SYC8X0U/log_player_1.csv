Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point that gives me some room to negotiate if Bob wants to counter-offer.  I also want to see if he's interested in paying a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $125. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $115 is still a good deal, especially compared to selling to John for $100. It's time to finalize the sale."
