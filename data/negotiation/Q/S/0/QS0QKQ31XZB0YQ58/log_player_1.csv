Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** While you know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, aiming slightly below that for Bob might secure a quicker deal. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting this as an ""exclusive opportunity"" could incentivize Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This strategy assumes limited time for back-and-forth negotiation. If time allows, a higher initial offer with room to negotiate down towards $800,000 might maximize profit."
