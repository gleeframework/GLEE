I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

$8,000 is significantly less than my minimum price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."

I'm offering $12,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
