"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit high on the price. Let's split the difference again and go with $97.50?  I really want this product, and I think this is a good price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was a bit too high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $101.50? It's still a bit higher than your initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",101.5,Alice,5,
