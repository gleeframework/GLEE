"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's possible for you to meet me there.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500.  This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced that I should pay $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,750 for the product. Can we compromise on that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,125? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $11,125. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",9500.0,Bob,6,
