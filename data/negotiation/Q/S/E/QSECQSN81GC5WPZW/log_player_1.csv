Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a price of $18,000, you're setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he wants to negotiate, he's likely to counter with a price closer to $18,000 than $12,000. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response.  You can always come down in price, but you can't go up from your initial offer."
