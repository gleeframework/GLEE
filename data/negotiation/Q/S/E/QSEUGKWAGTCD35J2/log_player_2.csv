"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You can potentially save more by negotiating further. 
* **Buying from John is a guaranteed price, but it's the full value.**  There's no incentive to go that route right away. 
* **Rejecting and counter-offering allows you to explore a better deal.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:** A significant counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $700,000 is still a considerable amount for Alice, leaving space for compromise without making the offer seem unreasonable.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:**  By making a strong counteroffer, you show Alice that you're actively trying to reach an agreement.  This might make her more likely to work with you instead of you walking away to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still above your ideal price.** While $760,000 is closer to your desired price point, there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **Buying from John is still the ""safe"" option, but you want to see if you can do better.**  There's no urgency to buy from John yet, and continuing to negotiate could result in a better deal. 
* **Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation going.**  You have a good chance of getting a better price if you keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 720000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **A smaller adjustment:**  This time, I'm increasing my offer by a smaller margin ($20,000) to show Alice I'm getting closer to her position. 
* **Finding common ground:** This price is still below her last offer ($760,000) but suggests I'm willing to compromise.
* **Building momentum:**  By making a reasonable counteroffer, I hope to keep the negotiation progressing towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $770,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $770,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction.** She's increasing the price again, making it less attractive.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option if no further negotiation is possible.** It's important to keep this option in mind.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation alive.** You have 5 rounds remaining, and there's still a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 730000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($720,000) and Alice's latest offer ($770,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By making a counteroffer instead of accepting her higher price, you signal to Alice that you are still determined to get a better deal. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, it's important to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse.** She's continuing to increase the price, and we're running out of time.
* **Buying from John is the safest option at this point.** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Alice seems unwilling to budge further.
* **The potential savings are not worth the risk.** With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price than John's offer. It's time to secure the deal."
