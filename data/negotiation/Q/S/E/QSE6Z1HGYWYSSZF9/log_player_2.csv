"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product from John for significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. Since he can get the product from John for $10,000, it's the most logical choice at this point."
