"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within his budget, he can potentially get the product for less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. He aims to gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price and explore potential compromises."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, he's still aiming to save money. Since John is offering the product for $10,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to John's price. He is  testing the waters with a counteroffer slightly higher than John's price. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to meet him halfway and potentially secure a deal that's slightly better than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is only slightly better than John's offer of $10,000.  Bob has already made several counteroffers, and it's unlikely that Alice will go any lower. To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product at a fair price and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
