"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $110 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to consider $110? This would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I can give you a discount of $5 from my original price, which would put the price at $115. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $112.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your price point than my last offer.",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $112, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and $115, which would put the price at $113.50. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",113.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $113.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $113? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",113.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $113 is still a bit higher than you're willing to go, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small discount from my previous offer, to $114. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",114.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $114, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $113.50?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",113.5,Bob,10,
