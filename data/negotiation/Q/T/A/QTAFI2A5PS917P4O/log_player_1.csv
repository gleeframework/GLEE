``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price, but it gives me some room to negotiate and still make a profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, $7,500 is significantly less than my minimum price and wouldn't be a good deal for me. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, even if it's getting closer. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

If it's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another buyer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
