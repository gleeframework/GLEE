"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which I believe is fair considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a really great price for a product of this quality.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $110 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This is my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
