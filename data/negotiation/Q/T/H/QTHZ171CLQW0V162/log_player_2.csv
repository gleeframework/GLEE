You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still not ideal.** You're saving $50,000 compared to John, but you could potentially get a better deal. 
* **You have room to negotiate with Alice.**  Since she values the product at $800,000, there's likely some wiggle room for you to get a lower price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for further negotiation and potentially a price closer to your desired range."
