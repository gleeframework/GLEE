**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I can still try to get a better deal. I have 8 more rounds and can still use the threat of selling to John if necessary."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and offers you a fair price. Let's close this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $8,900. I have 6 more rounds and can continue to negotiate with Bob, potentially bringing the price closer to my desired range.  I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the best option."

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for $8,950 yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,980 is a good deal.  It's above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I'll get a better offer in the limited time remaining.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
