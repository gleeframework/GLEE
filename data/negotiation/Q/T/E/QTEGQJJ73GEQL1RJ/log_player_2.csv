"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $9,500 is a decent starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a good price for you, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still above your target price of $8,000.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $8,500? This seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $8900. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,900 is still above your target price. While it's a good deal compared to the initial price, you have time to try and get it closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $8,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $8,700.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000. I'm willing to make another slight adjustment and offer it to you for $8950. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you're still slightly above your initial target of $8,000,  Alice is getting closer to your price, and it's likely that you'll be able to negotiate further down to your target in the next few rounds.  However, it's better to take the deal now rather than risk losing it and having to pay John's higher price."
