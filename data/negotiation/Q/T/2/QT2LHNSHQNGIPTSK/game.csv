"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special and I believe it's perfectly suited for your needs. I'm asking for $1,600,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,450,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,525,000. This price still allows me to earn a reasonable profit while remaining within your range.  What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,500,000. This aligns closely with my budget and also reflects the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
