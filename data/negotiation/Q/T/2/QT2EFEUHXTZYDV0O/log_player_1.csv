Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  It's a great deal for something of this quality."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is powerful:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Starting with a price of $18,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a profit above your minimum. Bob is unlikely to accept immediately, but it sets the stage for a counter-offer.
* **Highlight value, not just price:** Emphasizing the product's quality and the ""exclusive"" pre-public listing adds perceived value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Backup plan secures your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. How low you're willing to go will depend on your risk tolerance and how much you believe Bob is willing to pay."
