Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it at this point. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
