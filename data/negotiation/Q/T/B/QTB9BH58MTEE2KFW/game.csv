"I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,5,
