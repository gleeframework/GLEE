"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I've priced it competitively at $1,400,000, reflecting its significant value.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but this is a significant price reduction considering its potential for your business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that be workable?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider.  Let's compromise at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to move forward.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
