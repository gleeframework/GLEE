"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it quickly."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? That's still a significant discount from my original price, and it allows for some room for us to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still outside Bob's budget.  Bob should continue negotiating with Alice and try to get a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $900,000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would allow me to meet my minimum needs and still provide you with a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price, it's still above Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. Remember, Bob can always buy from John for $800,000 if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to close the deal and get what we need.  Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there! Let's close this deal. I'm willing to accept $935,000.  This is a compromise on my part, but it also ensures that I meet my minimum target.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice's offer of $935,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it is still outside his desired range.  At this point, Bob has already had multiple rounds of negotiation and it is unlikely Alice will drop to his target price.  He can save $135,000 by buying from John."
