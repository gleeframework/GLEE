"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80.  Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your life.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $100?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $110, and that's my final offer. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,
