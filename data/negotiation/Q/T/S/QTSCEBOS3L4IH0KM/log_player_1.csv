Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it valuable, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, but she needs to offer a price enticing to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so Alice needs to offer it below that to make it attractive.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $140 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $150 with John. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
