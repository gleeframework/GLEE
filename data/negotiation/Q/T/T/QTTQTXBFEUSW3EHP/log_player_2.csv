```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he's still determined to save as much as possible.  Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, and Bob believes there's still room to get a better price. He's not willing to pay above $9,000 yet.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now willing to go a bit higher than his previous offer, showing that he's serious about buying the product but is still aiming for a price within his desired range.  $9,500 represents a compromise, and it's a good opportunity to see if Alice is willing to meet halfway."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is proving stubborn and unwilling to budge significantly. Bob has been consistently trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice's counteroffers remain too high.  At this point, with only 3 rounds left, it's becoming clear that a deal with Alice is unlikely.  Buying from John for $8,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not lead to a favorable outcome."
