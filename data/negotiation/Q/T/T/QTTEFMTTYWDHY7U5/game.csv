,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Would you be willing to go for that?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This would still allow you to make a profit, and I'd be happy to take the product off your hands.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $87.50 just yet. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $92.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",92.5,Alice,5,
