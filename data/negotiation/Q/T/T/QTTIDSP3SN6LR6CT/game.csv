"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $15000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $11000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's closer to your asking price and still within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
