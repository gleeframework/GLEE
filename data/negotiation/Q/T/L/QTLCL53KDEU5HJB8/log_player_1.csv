Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $130 is above your $100 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $130 is still below the $150 value Bob places on the product, giving him a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can adjust your price while still aiming for a good profit.

Remember, you can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial $130 asking price, accepting Bob's $120 offer is the best decision here:

* **Profit:** You're still making a profit of $20, which is better than selling to John for $100.
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price. Bob might be firm on his $120 offer, and you could end up with nothing.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation takes time and energy. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to move on to other opportunities."
