Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and we're willing to sell it for $75. Let me know if this works for you!

While $75 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for $70.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 70}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $72? That's a $3 discount from our initial price, which is still higher than your proposed $70. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price of $70. While I could continue to negotiate,  $72 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard."
