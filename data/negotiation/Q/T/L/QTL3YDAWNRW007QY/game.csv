"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $14000?  I'm sure we can find a price we both agree on.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $16500? I'm open to negotiating further, but I think this is a fair starting point.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15000.  Let's see if we can come to a compromise.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I think $15500 is still a bit low considering the product's value. How about we try $15800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",15800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $15800 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go to $15600.  Let's try to close this deal.",15600.0,Bob,8,
