Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to the product's value to him, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob. Rejecting his offer will allow me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option:** Selling to John would secure my minimum value, but I can potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the market value and the initial offer you made.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to where I need to be, I can't go any lower than $1,375,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the additional support you're offering, but I'm still not willing to meet the $1,375,000 price point. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,325,000, and I'll also accept the consultation and technical support you're offering.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Round:** This is the final round of negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my desired value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of No Deal:**  There's a risk that rejecting Bob's offer could lead to no deal at all.
* **Guaranteed Minimum:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price of $1,500,000, which is a safe and reliable option. 
* **Future Potential:**  While I'm not getting the highest price, selling to John keeps my options open for potential future deals with Bob or other buyers who may be willing to pay closer to my desired value. 

Given the limited time and the risk of a no-deal scenario, selling to John is the most sensible decision in this situation."
