{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum threshold of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he has room to go higher if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is more than your absolute minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly less than what you initially offered ($10,000) and what you believe the product is worth.  There's room for Bob to increase his offer, and it's worth seeing if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This still gives you a great deal considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. It's very close to what John is offering, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob.  There's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and do $8,125. This is a great deal for both of us - you get the product for less than you originally offered, and I'm happy to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 8125}
