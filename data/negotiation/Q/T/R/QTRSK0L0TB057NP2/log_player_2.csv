$20,000 is way above my budget, so I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget. Hopefully, this will be a starting point for a productive negotiation."

$17,000 is still too high for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm offering $11,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still hoping to save some money."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with $16,000.  I'm going to keep negotiating.  It's starting to feel like John might be the better option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is getting very close to my maximum, but I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me halfway. I'm also getting closer to my limit on negotiation rounds, so I need to make a decision soon."
