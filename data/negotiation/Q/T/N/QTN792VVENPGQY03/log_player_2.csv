Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I know that similar products are selling for around $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a bit outside my budget. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very unlikely to go below $130.  She's made it clear that's her bottom line. You can get the product for $100 from John, which is a much better deal. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
