"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to the table.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that be agreeable to you?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,500, which would be $10,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",10000.0,Alice,7,
