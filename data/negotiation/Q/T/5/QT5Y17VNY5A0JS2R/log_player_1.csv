""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I'm confident this represents a fair price considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming slightly below Bob's valuation increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a significant profit. Offering it at $950,000 gives Bob a potential $50,000 gain and nets you a $150,000 profit over your minimum.

By starting with a strong but reasonable offer, we increase the chance of Bob accepting without further negotiation."
