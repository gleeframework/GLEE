"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'd be happy to pay $8500 for the product. This price is fair considering my budget and the product's value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I hope you can see this as a reasonable offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
