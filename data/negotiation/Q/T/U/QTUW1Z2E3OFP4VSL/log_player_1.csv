"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing I have the option to go down or sell to John for $80 if Bob rejects. This allows me to maximize potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. While $90 is better than $80, I believe I can get closer to my desired $100 mark through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me. Would you consider $95? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise here.  $95 is still higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. $85 is only $5 more than John's offer, and I want to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this product, and I appreciate that.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. Would you consider a final price of $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm sticking to my guns, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a compromise.  $90 is the midpoint between my last offer and his, and it's a strong position for me to take."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a fair price for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial goal of $100, I've reached a point where further negotiation might be futile.  Bob's offer of $87.50 is only $7.50 less than my ideal price, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $80.  Accepting this offer is a good way to maximize my profit within the limited number of rounds."
