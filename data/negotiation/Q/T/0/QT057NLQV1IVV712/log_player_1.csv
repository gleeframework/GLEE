{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value of $120, but leaves room for negotiation. This offer is also likely to be attractive to Bob as it is lower than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
