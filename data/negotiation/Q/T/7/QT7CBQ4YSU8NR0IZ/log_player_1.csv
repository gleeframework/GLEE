"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I'm going to see if I can get a bit more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time Bob's offer is closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to accept it, as it's only $500 less than my initial offer and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price with more rounds.  It's a good deal considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of getting a lower price later."
