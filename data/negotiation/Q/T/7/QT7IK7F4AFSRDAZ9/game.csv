"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, I believe $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $875,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
