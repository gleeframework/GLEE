"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $125. I can offer you a slight discount at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is my final offer, as I have another option for the same product at that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another option at $120, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $125, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",125.0,Alice,7,
