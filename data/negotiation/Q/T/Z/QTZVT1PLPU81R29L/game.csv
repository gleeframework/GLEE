"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product but need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. How about $95?  It's closer to what I can afford and still a fair price for the product. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $100.  That way, I can ensure I'm getting my minimum, and you still get a great deal on a valuable product.",100.0,Alice,5,
