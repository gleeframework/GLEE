Round 2

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
