"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to something closer to $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on this product, and I'm not quite comfortable going as low as $1600000. How about we meet in the middle at $1700000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to consider one last offer, Bob. I'm thinking we're very close to a deal. I can meet you at $1675000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,7,
