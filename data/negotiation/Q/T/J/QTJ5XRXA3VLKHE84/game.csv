"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $750000. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $800000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $675000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $675000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $500000.  Would you be open to $600000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",600000.0,Bob,4,
