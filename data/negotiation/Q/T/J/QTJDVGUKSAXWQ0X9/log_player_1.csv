Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $10,500 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
