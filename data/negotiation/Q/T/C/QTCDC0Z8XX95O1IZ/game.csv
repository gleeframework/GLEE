"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price closer to my maximum budget of $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1500000 is still too low for me.  I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1650000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
