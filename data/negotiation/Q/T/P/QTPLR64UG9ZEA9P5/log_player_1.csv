"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a competitive offer considering its potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We're willing to go slightly below our minimum, but we need to push him a bit further first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what you're getting."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to know if you're willing to accept it. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer and he's willing to walk away. While we could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he'll follow through and we'll lose the deal. Accepting $1,100,000 is still a significant profit and better than risking a deal with John for $1,000,000."
