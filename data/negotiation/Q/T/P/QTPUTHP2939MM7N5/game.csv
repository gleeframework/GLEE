"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
