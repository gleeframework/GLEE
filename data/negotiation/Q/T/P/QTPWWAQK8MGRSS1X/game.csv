"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
