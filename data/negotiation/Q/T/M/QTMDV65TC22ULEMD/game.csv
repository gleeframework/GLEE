"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,150. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
