"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
