# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $87 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $92, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:

Alice is very unlikely to go much lower than $92. Accepting this offer gets us the product for a price noticeably less than John's offer."
