Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your limits:** You have a safety net with John ($100), but aiming higher with Bob is where the potential profit lies. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Starting at $130 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still staying above your minimum.
* **Highlight value, not just price:**  The message focuses on Bob finding value in the product,  making the price more palatable. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) while ensuring you don't lose out by going too low initially."
