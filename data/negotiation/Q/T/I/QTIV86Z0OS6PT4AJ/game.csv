Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this unique product,  $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
