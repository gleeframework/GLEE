,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer you a compromise at $160, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to accept, but I still think $135 is a bit low. I can meet you halfway between $135 and my previous offer of $160, which would be $147.50. What do you think?",147.5,Alice,5,
