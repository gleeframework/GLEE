Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While the product is only worth $100 to Bob, starting with a price higher than his perceived value leaves room for negotiation or for him to accept a lower counter-offer.
* **Leaving Margin:** Offering it at $125 still provides a $25 profit margin if Bob accepts, which is better than selling to John for $150.
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message emphasizes value and portrays the offer as a special deal, subtly encouraging Bob to consider it favorably."
