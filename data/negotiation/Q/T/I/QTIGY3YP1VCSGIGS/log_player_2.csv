"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you plenty of time to try and get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  By rejecting, you can start the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to your desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  $9,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still a fair price considering your budget. 
* **Leave room for negotiation.**  You want to give Alice some wiggle room to accept, but also leave yourself space to counteroffer again if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target.**  $8,500 is a good price, especially since you have already rejected her initial offer.
* **Time is a factor.**  With only 8 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures you get the product without risking running out of time.
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  You can always choose to go with John if you don't get a better deal from Alice in the remaining rounds."
