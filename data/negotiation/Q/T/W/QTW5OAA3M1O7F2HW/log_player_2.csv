"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price, making it worthwhile to reject the offer and counter."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my final offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your budget, but it's closer to your ideal price point. You can likely negotiate a better deal, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy.  You want to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
