"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
