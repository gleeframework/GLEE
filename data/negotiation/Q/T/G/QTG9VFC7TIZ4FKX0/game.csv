"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
