Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to make a counteroffer to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing a price of $900,000.

This is a significant saving for you compared to selling to John, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset for me.
