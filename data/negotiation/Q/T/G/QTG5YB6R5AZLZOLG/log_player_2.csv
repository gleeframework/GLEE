While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to try negotiating further to see if we can reach a price closer to $12,000."

While I'd love to continue negotiating,  $13,250 is a great deal, and I'm happy with the price. It's lower than John's price and a decent savings from Alice's initial offer.  I'll take it!"
