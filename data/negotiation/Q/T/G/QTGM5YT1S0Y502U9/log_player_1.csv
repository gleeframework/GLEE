{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit slightly.
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but might entice him if he believes the product is worth more than that or if there's a perceived scarcity.

This approach aims to balance securing a sale with maximizing your potential profit."
