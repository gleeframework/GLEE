Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. I'm also keeping John in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I believe the product has more value and I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still a significant amount above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach a deal.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where Bob sees the value and is willing to pay a bit more, while still being a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,600,000, which is a good compromise and a lot closer to my desired price. I'm happy to accept his offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk further negotiation driving him away or losing out to John's offer."
