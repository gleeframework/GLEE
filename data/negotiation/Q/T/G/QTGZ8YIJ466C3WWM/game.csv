"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my limit and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on it.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
