Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation, but also reflects the high value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the value I'd like to get for the product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 
 
I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer. I hope we can find a middle ground."
