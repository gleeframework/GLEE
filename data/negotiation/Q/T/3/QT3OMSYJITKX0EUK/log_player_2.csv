"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I want to see if I can get an even better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to attempt a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $85?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$92.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with, but it's closer to my desired price point. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get it down further.  I'm still within my budget and have several rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 90}
