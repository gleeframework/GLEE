Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $10,000, Alice should aim to sell it to Bob for the same price to maximize her profit. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly, even if it's slightly above his perceived value. 
* **Not Disclosing John's Offer:** Alice doesn't want to reveal that she has a guaranteed buyer, as this could weaken her negotiating position."
