"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $180. I'm willing to pay $160 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $160 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $170. It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. What do you say?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $165 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $165 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $167.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love this product.",167.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can do a bit better. I'm willing to pay $161 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",161.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time, so I'm going to have to be firm on my price.  I'm willing to accept $163 for the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",163.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're running out of time, but I'm not willing to go above $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $161.50. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",161.5,Bob,10,
