"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, there's room to bargain. Rejecting the initial offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's a bit more than halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum price. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, and it gives us room to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $4,500, which is a good price considering my maximum is $8,000. Accepting this offer saves me $3,500 compared to buying from John. There's always the chance I could get it lower, but the risk of going further and then having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential reward."
