"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to be realistic about the price.  I'm willing to move up to $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if we have a deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move up to $780,000, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,7,
