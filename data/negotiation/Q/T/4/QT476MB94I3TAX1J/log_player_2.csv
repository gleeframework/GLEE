"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get a better deal than $1,200,000.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully initiate a productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal. It's lower than your initial counteroffer and still within your budget. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal or you missing out on the product altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
