"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle on a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
