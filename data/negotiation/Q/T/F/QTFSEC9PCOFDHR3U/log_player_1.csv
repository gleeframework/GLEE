"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for negotiation here, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Staying above my Minimum:** The price is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, which I can get from John. 

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could accept his offer and secure a sale, it's not worth losing out on potentially a higher price.
* **Negotiation Continues:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price. 

I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's less than what I can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm trying to find a middle ground by coming down from my initial offer. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out if Bob rejects again.
* **Reasoning with Bob:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value. 

I'm hoping that Bob will find this counteroffer more appealing and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  
* **Close But Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough to justify selling the product at a loss.
* **Continuing Negotiations:** I have more rounds available, so I can continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  It's possible that I can convince Bob to come up a bit more. 

I'm hopeful that I can reach a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for less than what I know I can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,450,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $1,550,000. This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Moving Closer:** This price is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price, which makes it a safer option.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits for both of us, highlighting how it's a win-win situation.

I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can finally reach a deal. If not, I'm still prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and I'm willing to compromise further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum price.
* **Minimal Progress:** Bob's offers have only increased incrementally, and there's no indication that he's willing to meet my price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I've already been negotiating for a while, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and minimizes the risk of losing more time and potentially ending up with nothing.

Selling to John provides a certain and satisfactory outcome, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a higher risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
