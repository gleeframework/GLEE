"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,300,000.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's value for the product, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further, while still allowing Bob to save a substantial amount of money compared to Alice's offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price."
