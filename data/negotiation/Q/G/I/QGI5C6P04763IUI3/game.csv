"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,250.  This gives us both a fair deal.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,875. This would give you a good price while staying within my budget. What do you say?",11875.0,Bob,4,
