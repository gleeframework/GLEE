"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,500.

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to give up on the extra $500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to budge any further.",12250.0,Alice,7,
