"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I believe this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to get a good return, while being reasonable for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000?  This shows I'm willing to compromise while recognizing the value of the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is still a considerable distance from what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,250,000? This price is fair to both of us, considering the product's value and your interest in acquiring it.  I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise, getting us closer to a deal that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
