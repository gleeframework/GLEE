{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to sell to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I believe this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to get a good return, while being reasonable for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000?  This shows I'm willing to compromise while recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'd be better off selling to John at this point. However, I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before I give up. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is still a considerable distance from what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,250,000? This price is fair to both of us, considering the product's value and your interest in acquiring it.  I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise, getting us closer to a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly what John is offering. While I'd prefer to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing both buyers.  Selling to John is the safest option at this point."
