Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is above my minimum of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging. This helps build rapport and potentially motivates Bob to consider my offer. 
* **No immediate fallback:**  I'm not mentioning John or my fallback price yet. I want to see if I can get a good deal from Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.  Even if I can't get my full asking price, I'm likely to get something closer to my minimum if I counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I want to exhaust the possibility of a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to be fair to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise, coming down from my initial $15,000 but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  The message emphasizes ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to see my offer as reasonable. 
* **Keeping the conversation open:**  I'm using a question to prompt Bob's response and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $12000 as a compromise. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No need to counter:**  I've already countered and it's likely Bob won't go higher. There's no point in risking a further rejection. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and positive outcome. 
* **Selling to John is redundant:**  Selling to John would yield the same amount, but Bob's offer represents a successful negotiation."
