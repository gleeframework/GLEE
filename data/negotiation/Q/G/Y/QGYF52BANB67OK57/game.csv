"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1300000. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1300000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1320000. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to go above $1300000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Can you reconsider your offer?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
