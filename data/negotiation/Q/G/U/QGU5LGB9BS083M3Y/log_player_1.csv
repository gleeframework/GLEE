Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid a Too High Price:**  If we start too high (e.g., $140), Bob might be immediately turned off and reject the offer without counter-offering.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
