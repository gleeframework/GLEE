"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product does seem interesting, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground.  He's signaling that he's serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000, and it's closer to his initial counteroffer of $13,000.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown willingness to compromise, meeting Bob halfway.
* **Time:**  Accepting the offer saves time and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a higher price or a failure to reach an agreement.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a chance that Alice might become less willing to compromise, or the negotiation could drag on, potentially leading him to buy from John at a higher price."
