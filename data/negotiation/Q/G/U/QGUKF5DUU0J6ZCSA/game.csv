"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,400,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,400,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more aggressive. Would you consider $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to finalize the transaction. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,
