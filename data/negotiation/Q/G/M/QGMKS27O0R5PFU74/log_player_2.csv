"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,200,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're serious about the negotiation but not willing to accept a price anywhere near her initial offer.  We have plenty of rounds to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer, but it's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in a fair deal - how about we bring the price down to something more realistic?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  However, your offer is quite a bit below what I believe is a fair reflection of this product's value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $1,900,000 is still way too high. We need to show her we're willing to walk away if the price isn't significantly lower. Her offer in round 3 was not a substantial move from her first offer.  We'll continue negotiating, but we need to be prepared to walk away and take John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but we're still a long way apart. To be frank, if we can't find a price closer to my budget, I'll have to consider John's offer.  I'm proposing $1,100,000 -  it's a significant jump from my last offer, showing I'm serious about getting this done."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm glad you're serious about this deal. It's a unique product, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  Let's bridge the gap - I propose $1,700,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but her concessions are too slow.  We're still significantly above our budget, and we need to keep the pressure on.  Another rejection will signal that she needs to make a much more substantial move if she wants to close the deal with us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price is still significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on this, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John's offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. However, this product's unique value justifies the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,600,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a crucial moment. Alice is claiming this is her final offer, but it's still considerably higher than our budget and John's offer. By rejecting this offer, we're demonstrating that we're serious about our budget and willing to walk away from the deal. There's a risk Alice won't budge, but it's a calculated one we need to take to try and secure the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I respect your position, but I can't justify going that high.  My absolute maximum is $1,300,000. I understand this is a firm offer, and I'm taking a risk here. However, I believe this is a fair deal considering John's offer is still available.  It's your call."",
