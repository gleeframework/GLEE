"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,200,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer, but it's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in a fair deal - how about we bring the price down to something more realistic?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  However, your offer is quite a bit below what I believe is a fair reflection of this product's value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but we're still a long way apart. To be frank, if we can't find a price closer to my budget, I'll have to consider John's offer.  I'm proposing $1,100,000 -  it's a significant jump from my last offer, showing I'm serious about getting this done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm glad you're serious about this deal. It's a unique product, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  Let's bridge the gap - I propose $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price is still significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on this, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John's offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. However, this product's unique value justifies the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,600,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is as low as I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position, but I can't justify going that high.  My absolute maximum is $1,300,000. I understand this is a firm offer, and I'm taking a risk here. However, I believe this is a fair deal considering John's offer is still available.  It's your call.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
