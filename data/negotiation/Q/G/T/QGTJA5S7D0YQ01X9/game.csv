"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're motivated to sell, but $1,800,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to compromise further, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,650,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
