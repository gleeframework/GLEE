"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
