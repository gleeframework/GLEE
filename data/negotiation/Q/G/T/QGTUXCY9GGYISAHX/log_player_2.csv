"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will lower her price, and even if she doesn't, you can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,250 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer to my target price, it's still not a deal I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise.  If not, I can always buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
