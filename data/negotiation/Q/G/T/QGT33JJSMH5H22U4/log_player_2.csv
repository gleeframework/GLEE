"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits you'll gain from it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her stated value, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about buying but need a more attractive price point.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to your price range, but you're only $50,000 away from your backup option with John. It's worth pushing a little further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:**  By increasing your offer, you're signaling to Alice that you're serious about finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Stays Below John's Price:**  You're still leaving yourself a buffer from your backup option.
* **Aims for a Midpoint:** This offer targets roughly the midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, attempting to find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating in good faith, but the price difference is now quite small.  Her latest offer of $1,012,500 is only $12,500 less than your backup option with John. At this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of further negotiation. It's time to secure the product at your target price from John."
