"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but one that's still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Message:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price isn't too aggressive, allowing for a possible counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to get a price closer to my desired outcome while also giving Bob a sense that he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** 
* **I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, but I do see potential to negotiate with Bob.**

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and attempt to get a higher price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $8,000 because I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a good offer, I need to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make this sale."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm lowering my price, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $11,000, he's still getting a good deal.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and optimistic.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance. It's a compromise, but it keeps the negotiation moving towards a potentially successful outcome while also protecting my minimum profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**
* **I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob.**

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low. However, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I believe that I can potentially secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising Further:** I'm adjusting my price again, showing a willingness to compromise while remaining above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution for both of us.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise while still maximizing my profit. By suggesting a ""fair"" price, I'm trying to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** 
* **We've reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better deal with Bob.**
* **John is willing to pay my minimum price, which is more attractive than continuing to negotiate with Bob.**

**Strategy:**

The negotiations with Bob have been going on for a while, and I'm not seeing much progress. While I'd prefer to sell the product for more, John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum.  It's better to lock in a sale than risk continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price or having the deal fall through entirely."
