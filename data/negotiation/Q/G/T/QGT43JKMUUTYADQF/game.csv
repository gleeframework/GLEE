"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $12,500? That's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $11,250 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,750 as a final compromise.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $11,100.  That's about as high as I can go.",11100.0,Bob,6,
