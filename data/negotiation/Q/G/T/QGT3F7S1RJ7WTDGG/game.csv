,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for it, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $18,500? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $18,500 is closer, it's still higher than what I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $17,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in it.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand where you're coming from.  Let's split the difference - $17,750.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and acknowledges your budget concerns.",17750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $17,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17,250. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's close the deal at this price.",17250.0,Bob,6,
