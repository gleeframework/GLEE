"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its high value and unique features, it's worth noting that the product holds significant importance to me, reflecting its worth at least $15,000. However, considering your appreciation for its potential and the benefits it could bring to you, I am extending a special offer. I am willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This price reflects a balance between the product's true value and your estimated worth of $10,000, while also ensuring a fair profit for me. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you would like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no need to pay $12,000 when you have a guaranteed option for less. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for her to potentially counter with a lower price, or you can proceed with buying from John."
