Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value to you, the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") signaling you are open to discussing the price further if Bob counters. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, if Bob is highly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more appealing.  
* You have a strong fallback position with John, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
