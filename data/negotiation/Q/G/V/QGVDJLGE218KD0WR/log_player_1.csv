Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** I'm not selling for less than $80, so $90 gives me some profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is willing to pay more, I can still increase the price.
* **It's not too high:** If Bob values the product less than $90, he's still likely to find it a good deal compared to John's offer of $80."
