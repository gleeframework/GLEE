"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than her value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's best to try and lower the price further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would still be a profitable transaction for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my desired price. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  I have enough rounds left to potentially get a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  This offer gives you a significant profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,220,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, bringing her offer down from $1,250,000 to $1,220,000. This is closer to my desired price point, and it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to get a better deal.  It's better to accept her offer and avoid the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or having to buy from John at a higher price."
