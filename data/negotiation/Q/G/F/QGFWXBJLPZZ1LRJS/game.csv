"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  This price reflects its worth to me, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which is a significant step closer to your desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
