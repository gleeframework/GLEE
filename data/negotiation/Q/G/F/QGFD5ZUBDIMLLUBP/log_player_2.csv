"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $11,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get an even lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,250 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject again, leading to a potential deal with John at $12,000.
* **Compromise:** Alice has already compromised by meeting Bob halfway, suggesting further negotiation might be difficult.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price without risking a higher price from John."
