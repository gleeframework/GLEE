Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $119. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $119 allows you to capture almost all the potential surplus value ($20) while ensuring Bob is still likely to buy it since it's just below his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high sale price and a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
