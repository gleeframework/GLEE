"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $800000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm willing to go to $900000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,4,
