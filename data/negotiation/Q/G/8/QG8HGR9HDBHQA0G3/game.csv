"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $150. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to look at other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $175 and $150. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $162.50. It's a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you.",162.5,Alice,5,
