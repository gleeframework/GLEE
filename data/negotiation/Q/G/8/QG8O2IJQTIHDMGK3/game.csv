"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $11,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested!",11200.0,Alice,5,
