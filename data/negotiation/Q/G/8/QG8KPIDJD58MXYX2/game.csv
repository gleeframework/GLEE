"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still offers you a good profit margin.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,225,000. Can we meet at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
