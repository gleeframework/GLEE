Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $750000, which would be $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $800500. Can we meet at this price?",800500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll meet you halfway between $825000 and $800500, which would be $812500. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
