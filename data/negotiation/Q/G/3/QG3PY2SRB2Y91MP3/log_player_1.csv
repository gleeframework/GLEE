Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting in the wings."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John provides a guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting Alice closer to her desired profit.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (""John"") introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob with a price potentially attractive while still maximizing Alice's potential profit."
