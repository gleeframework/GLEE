"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $85? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not comfortable with $85. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?,78.0,Bob,4,
