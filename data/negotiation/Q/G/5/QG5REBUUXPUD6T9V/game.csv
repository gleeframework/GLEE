"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is still a tough sell, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I do need to let you know that I have another interested buyer, so I can't guarantee this offer will be available for long.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Given the other potential buyer, how about we compromise at $12,000?  That's a fair offer considering my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
