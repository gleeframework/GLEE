Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that John's offer of $12,000 provides a safety net if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his value. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more, but I'm still ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough that it might be worth it to accept and avoid further negotiations.  If I reject and counteroffer, there's no guarantee that he will accept, and I might end up having to sell to John for a lower profit.  I'll take the $9,000 and move on."
