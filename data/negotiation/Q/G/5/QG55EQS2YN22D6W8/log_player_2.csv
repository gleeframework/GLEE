"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save money by rejecting it and negotiating with Alice further.  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price."
