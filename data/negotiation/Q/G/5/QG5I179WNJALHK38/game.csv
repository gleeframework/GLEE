"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $12000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000, but I'll throw in some extras that will make it worth your while. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
