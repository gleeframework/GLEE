Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are relatively small. At this point, accepting his offer of $1,400,000 would still leave a significant gap compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  

It's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer in the remaining rounds to bridge that $100,000 difference. Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
