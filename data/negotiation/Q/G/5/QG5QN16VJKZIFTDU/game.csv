"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is reasonable, I believe the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I'm confident this will prove to be a wise investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and acknowledges the value you see in the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
