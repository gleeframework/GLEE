Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. Highlighting the product's value to Bob is key. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher sale price than John's guaranteed offer."
