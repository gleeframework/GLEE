Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, and I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm starting to get a bit anxious about the time, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $1,080,000 is still quite far off from my desired price, and I think I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can push him higher, and I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,080,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1120000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my desired price with Bob,  I'm starting to run out of time. John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is much closer to my desired value than what Bob is willing to pay.  I'd rather take the secure deal than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
