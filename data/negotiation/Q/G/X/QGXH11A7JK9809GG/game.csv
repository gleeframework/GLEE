"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, the unique benefits this product offers do command a premium price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the value you're getting while acknowledging the significant potential this unlocks for your business.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me, so I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000 is the maximum I can go, but I can do $1,300,000",1300000.0,Bob,4,
