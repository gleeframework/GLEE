"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly before even considering accepting.  Buying from John is an option, but it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay less than $100, so starting with a low offer of $80 gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful while clearly stating that the initial offer was unacceptable. 
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $140 is still significantly more than our $100 limit and our target price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to bring the price down further.
* **John as Backup:**  We still have the option of buying from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $140 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:**  We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but staying firmly below our $100 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  $95 is close to our maximum, this offer will help us gauge how close we can get to our ideal price.
* **Time Factor:**  As we progress through the rounds, it might be necessary to consider John's offer more seriously if we can't reach an agreement with Alice soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the back and forth. It seems we're getting closer. How about $125? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Above Budget:**  $125 is still above our $100 budget, even though it's getting closer to Alice's value.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed price of $100, ensuring we stay within our budget.

At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Alice outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
