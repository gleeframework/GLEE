"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting allows Bob to start negotiating a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, he can still get the product for $800,000 from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might allow him to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $20000, so the effective price would be $830000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $830,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price of $800,000, the added service brings the effective price down to $830,000.  This is a better deal than buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get him a significantly lower price."
