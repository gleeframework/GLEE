"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $14000 is a bit lower than I can realistically accept at this time. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to sell for $14500, which would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",14500.0,Alice,3,
