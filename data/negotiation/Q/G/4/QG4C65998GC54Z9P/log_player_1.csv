Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $15,000 sets a high initial bar and gives room for negotiation. 
* **Value Statement:**  Highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob creates interest.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the deal can subtly influence Bob.
* **Flexibility:** This offer leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, ensuring a potential deal. 
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget allows for a lower price. I am willing to pay $14000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My goal is to maximize earnings, and $14,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially reach a higher price point.
* **Potential for Compromise:** While I'm not willing to sell for $14,000, a counteroffer could be a good middle ground.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be a significant loss, so rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $14,000 is a bit lower than I can realistically accept at this time. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to sell for $14,500, which would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a higher price.
* **Fairness:**  Stating that $14,500 is a ""fair deal"" for both parties subtly reinforces the price.
* **Flexibility:** The offer is still slightly higher than Bob's initial offer, leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **Avoiding Loss:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than John's offer, ensuring that selling to Bob would still be a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering my budget, I am able to agree to a price of $14200 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While not my ideal price, $14,200 is close enough to my target range, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Further negotiations may lead to a lower price or a stalled deal.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale."
