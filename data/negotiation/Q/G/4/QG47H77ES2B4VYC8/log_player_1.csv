"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he's not, it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $122.  This is another compromise, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $119
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've rejected Bob's offer.  While $119 is closer to my minimum, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $120, it's more prudent to sell to him at this point."
