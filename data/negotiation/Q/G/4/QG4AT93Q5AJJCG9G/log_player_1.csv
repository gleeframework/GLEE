Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product if he values it highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for that right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping to get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I've already compromised.  I'm not going to get more from Bob, so I'll sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum value."
