However, considering its true value and the investment we've made into it, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents a significant savings compared to the market rate, while still allowing us to cover our costs and ensure the sustainability of our business. I trust that you'll find this offer compelling and look forward to your positive response. Should you have any questions or require further information, please don't hesitate to reach out.
