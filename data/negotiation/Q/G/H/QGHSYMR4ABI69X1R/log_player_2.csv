{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking $150. It's not a good deal. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
You're willing to pay $110 for the product, which is a good starting point for negotiation. This offer leaves room for compromise while still being below your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to your maximum price of $120, it's still not a good deal. You can likely negotiate a better price, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

You're willing to pay $115, which is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's. This shows you're serious about buying the product but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, it's still $5 more than what you're willing to pay. It's better to buy from John at this point and save yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
