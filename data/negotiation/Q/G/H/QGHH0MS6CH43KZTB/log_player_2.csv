{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I will reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm offering $120 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's original price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $175 is closer to my limit, it's still too high. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm raising my offer to $140. This is getting closer to my maximum, but I'm hoping to close the deal within my budget."
