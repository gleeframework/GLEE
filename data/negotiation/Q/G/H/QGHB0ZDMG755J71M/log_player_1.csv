Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. We have 8 rounds left."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to your business."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is still lower than what I'm aiming for, and I have 6 rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  Let's meet in the middle again.
