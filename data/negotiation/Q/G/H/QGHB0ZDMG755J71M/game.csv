"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth even more in your hands. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within your budget.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
