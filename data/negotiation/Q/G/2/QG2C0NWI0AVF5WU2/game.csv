"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair deal to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $80.50? It's a small step down from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",80.5,Alice,5,

"I like the direction we're heading, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $77. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $81? It's a small step up from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",81.0,Alice,7,
