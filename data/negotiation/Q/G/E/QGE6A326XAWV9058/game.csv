"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1300000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm prepared to offer $1100000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
