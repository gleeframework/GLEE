"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15000. It's a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $12000. It's a fair price given the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a little too high for me. I'm going to stick to my offer of $12000. If that's not acceptable, I might have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. It's a bit lower than my initial asking price, but still reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $14000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $12000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other options.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still firm on your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13250. It's a bit lower than my previous offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to make this one last concession. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $13250 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $12000.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to move forward with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,10,
