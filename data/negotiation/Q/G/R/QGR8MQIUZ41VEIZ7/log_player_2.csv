{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $120 is still too high for Bob, and there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness about buying the product while also pushing for a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already shown he's willing to compromise. Offering $110 keeps the negotiation moving forward, and it's a reasonable price that might be acceptable to Alice, especially given her own value of $80. It also leaves a small buffer for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a decrease from her previous offer, it's still above his target price.  He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been consistently pushing for a lower price. Offering $120 is a compromise, demonstrating that he's serious about closing the deal. It's also a price that might be appealing to Alice, considering her own valuation of $80. There's still room for Alice to make a small counteroffer, but it's very likely she'll accept this offer to avoid risking losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and they are now down to their last three rounds. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to simply buy the product from John for $150.  Although this price is higher than Bob's target, it avoids further negotiation and ensures he gets the product. With only three rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and he could end up with nothing."
