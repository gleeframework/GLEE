"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'm willing to meet Alice halfway and offer $1,400,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that goes beyond its immediate price tag.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice wants to meet in the middle, but I'd like to try to get an even better deal. I'm still willing to pay up to $1,400,000, so I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than Alice's new offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since Alice is willing to meet in the middle, I'll try to meet her at a price that's slightly lower than that. I'll offer $1,475,000, which is $25,000 less than Alice's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,475,000 is close, but I need to be firm.  Would you consider $1,490,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm still willing to pay $1,475,000, so I'll stick with that price. I'll also try to add a bit of a persuasive message to see if I can get Alice to reconsider.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,490,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,475,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'd love to hear you out and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1475000}"
