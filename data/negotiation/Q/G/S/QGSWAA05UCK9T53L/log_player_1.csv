Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offering $900,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value ($800,000). It leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $800,000 gives me a solid baseline.  If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed to not lose money. 
* **Strategic thinking:**  This approach balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk. I'm taking a chance to get more, but not at the cost of losing out on a guaranteed sale."
