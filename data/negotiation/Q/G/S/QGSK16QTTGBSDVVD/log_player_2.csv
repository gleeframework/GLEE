{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  Since you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer shows a serious intent to negotiate while also leaving room for a compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a decent profit for Alice and leaves some space for her to counter."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room for improvement.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further.  We have a few rounds left and don't want to rush into a decision."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased slightly, but it's still higher than our desired price.  A counteroffer of $1,100,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.  This price is closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, increasing the chances of her accepting."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has increased again, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. We have a few rounds left and can afford to keep pushing for a better price.  We're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price, and it's likely Alice will be more amenable to a counteroffer in the next round."
