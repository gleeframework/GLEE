I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher offer in the next round."

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next rounds. It's better to secure this deal than risk losing both Bob and John."
