"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be a real asset to you. Given the value it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the middle ground you suggested, but unfortunately, I still can't reach $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his $11,000 offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away in a later round."
