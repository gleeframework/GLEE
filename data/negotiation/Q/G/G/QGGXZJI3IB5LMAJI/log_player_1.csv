"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is high enough that I can make concessions in later rounds if necessary. 

**Important Note:** While I want to maximize my profit, I also want to keep in mind the possibility of going with John if negotiations with Bob fail. I need to be strategic and ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is key:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely secure a better price by counteroffering.
* **Balancing risk:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm not yet willing to give up on Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate by offering a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing this as a ""split the difference"" proposal, making it sound more appealing and less aggressive.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reinforcing the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.

**Important Note:** This is still a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but I'm not giving away too much at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, but I'm still holding out hope that I can secure a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my minimum, aiming for a compromise that's more favorable to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the true value of the product and would make it a truly worthwhile investment for you. "", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** I'm proposing my minimum price, making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition and how this price is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth to him. 
* **Call to Action:**  I'm putting the ball back in Bob's court, giving him the opportunity to accept or reject this final offer.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round. It's important to be firm but also not close the door completely on a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Limited time and diminishing returns:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum and a secure deal.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price or no deal at all outweighs the potential of a slightly better deal. It's time to secure the guaranteed profit and move on."
