"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but Bob is trying to establish a starting point for negotiation.  The hope is that Alice will counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, leading to a faster deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's counteroffer, but $700,000 is still a significant amount.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There's still room to maneuver before having to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $650,000 is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest price.  This move could potentially entice Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is getting close to Bob's target price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise.  It's also worth noting that if Bob rejects this offer, he's only got 5 rounds left before he has to buy from John.  At this point, it's a better strategy to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that is still significantly lower than John's."
