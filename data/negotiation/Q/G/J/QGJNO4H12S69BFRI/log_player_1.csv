"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and exclusivity, subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By anchoring the negotiation close to Bob's valuation, we increase the likelihood of closing a deal within our desired price range.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while remaining aware of the alternative offer from John ($1,000,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, we have room to negotiate. We are still early in the negotiation process (Round 2 out of 10). Rejecting this offer allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our desired range. We will aim to counter with a price that keeps the negotiation moving forward but also secures a better profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,110,000."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and slightly reduce our price from $1,150,000 to $1,110,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, we keep the reduction relatively small to signal the product's high value.
* **Focusing on Value:**  We reiterate the product's exceptional value, aiming to shift Bob's focus from his budget constraints to the potential benefits and returns.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise, indicating our interest in closing the deal while maintaining a firm position on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but we're still significantly above John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer. We have the leverage to push slightly further.  Rejecting this keeps the negotiation open and allows us to counter in a way that encourages Bob towards a more favorable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal, but the price needs to reflect the true value of what I'm offering.  How about we meet halfway at $1,095,000?"",
""product_price"": 1095000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Compromise:** We introduce a sense of urgency by expressing our desire to close the deal. Proposing a price directly in the middle of the previous offers ($1,110,000 and $1,080,000) signals a significant concession while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Anchoring and Framing:** By framing the offer as ""meeting halfway,"" we aim to make it psychologically more appealing to Bob, suggesting fairness and a win-win scenario.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us well above John's alternative offer and maintains a reasonable position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. In light of my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is reasonably close to our previous counteroffer and still significantly above John's offer. We've progressed through more than half of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's increments are getting smaller. Accepting now:

* **Secures a Strong Profit:** We achieve a profit of $75,000 over our minimum and $75,000 over John's guaranteed offer.
* **Mitigates Risk:** Prolonging negotiations increases the risk of Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer.
* **Prioritizes Time Value:** Closing the deal now allows us to allocate time and resources to other potential opportunities."
