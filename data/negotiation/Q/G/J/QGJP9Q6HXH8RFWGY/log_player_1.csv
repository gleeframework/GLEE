Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you bargaining power.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob more likely to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** This initial offer is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your bottom line is $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)."
