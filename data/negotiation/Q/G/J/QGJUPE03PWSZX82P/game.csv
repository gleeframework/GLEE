"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,150? That would be a fair price for both of us.",9150.0,Alice,3,

"I see, Alice. $9,150 is a bit out of my range at the moment. I'll counter with $9,000. I hope this is within your consideration.",9000.0,Bob,4,
