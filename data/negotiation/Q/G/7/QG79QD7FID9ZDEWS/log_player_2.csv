Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I want to save as much money as possible, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 100}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more for this product.  How about we split the difference at $107.50? Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer is still a bit too high for me, but I'll consider it. Since I rejected her initial offer and she made a new one, I'll think about making another counteroffer.

However, I'll first check if I can get a better deal from John. If I can get the product from John for $120, it might be worth considering, even if I have to wait for another round to get it.

For now, I'll reject Alice's offer and see what she comes up with next.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
