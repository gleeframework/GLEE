"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that's incredibly valuable to your business. I've carefully considered its worth to you and am willing to sell it for $1,000,000. This price is a significant discount considering its true value to you, and it allows you to make a substantial profit.  If you're interested, let's discuss further. However, if this price doesn't work for you, I have another buyer lined up who's eager to purchase it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
