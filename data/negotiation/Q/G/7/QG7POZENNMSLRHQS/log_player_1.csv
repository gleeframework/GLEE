"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).  This creates a strong anchor in the negotiation and leaves room for me to make concessions while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value and framing the price as a ""starting point."" This suggests I'm open to negotiation but confident in the product's worth.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum price. This knowledge gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Test Bob's flexibility:**  I need to determine if he's willing to move closer to my desired price range.
* **Maintain negotiating position:** Accepting his first counteroffer could signal that I'm willing to concede easily. 

I'm comfortable rejecting this offer because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but with strength:**  I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer ($250,000 reduction) to signal flexibility. However, I am still aiming high above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:** By stating ""significantly higher value,"" I'm reiterating my belief in the product's worth, hoping to influence Bob's perception.
* **Seeking middle ground (but on my terms):**  Framing it as ""finding middle ground"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a willingness to meet closer to my range.
* **Time Value:**  While I have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the possibility of Bob not moving much further.

Accepting this offer balances maximizing profit with securing a timely deal, making it the most favorable option at this stage."
