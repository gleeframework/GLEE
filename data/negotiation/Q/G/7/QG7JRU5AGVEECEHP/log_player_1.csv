Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are still making a profit, and it sets the stage for potential counteroffers.
* **It's friendly:**  A friendly message helps establish a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $85?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
