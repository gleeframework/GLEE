"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer of $900000. However, I'm afraid I need to be more aggressive in my pricing to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to consider a price of $950000, but that's as low as I can go.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850000. Can we discuss further?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $975000. Can we discuss further?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Can you consider $825000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be realistic, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $925000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $800000, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I've made several concessions already, and I need to prioritize my minimum requirements. I'm afraid I'm not willing to make any further concessions. I'm going to hold out for a better offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $1000000, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
