"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit high. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
