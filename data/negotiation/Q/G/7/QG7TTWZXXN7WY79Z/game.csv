"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While the product is good, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still pushing my budget. To be honest, $775,000 is the highest I can justify.  Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is your limit, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
