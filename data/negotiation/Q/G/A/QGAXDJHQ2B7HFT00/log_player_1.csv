Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $950,000 is too far below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated for the true value of this product. How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is a good price and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
