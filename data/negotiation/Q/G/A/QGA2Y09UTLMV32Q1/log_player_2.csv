"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can get it lower. I have 10 rounds and a backup option, so I can afford to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider a price of $950,000.  This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's first offer, I still have room to negotiate further. I want to see if I can get it closer to my ideal price of $950,000.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to come up to $1,000,000, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,020,000, which is a fair price for me. While I'd prefer to get it down to $1,000,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price. This is a good deal and ensures I get the product within my budget."
