Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,000,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a more substantial reduction. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, his counter-offers are quite aggressive and suggest he may not be willing to meet near the product's true value.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
