"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget limitations. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $1100000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1150000, which is a fair compromise. This price is very close to your offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
