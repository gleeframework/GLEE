"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $10,000. I know this is your bottom line, but I hope you'll consider it. This price works for my budget, and it's fair to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
