"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1450000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1475000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a fair price given the product's potential and its value to you.",1475000.0,Alice,3,
