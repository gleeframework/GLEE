"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $13,000 is still above Alice's value for the product ($12,000), but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($14,000). This gives Alice an incentive to accept the offer, while still allowing Bob to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and slightly higher than Bob's previous counteroffer of $13,000. Accepting the offer means Bob saves money compared to buying from John, and is a good middle ground given Alice's previous rejection.  Further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, but there is a risk that Alice will reject the offer and the deal will fall through."
