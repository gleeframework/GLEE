Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage. I believe it's a reasonable starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's so far below what I consider fair. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $18,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for him, and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, even though it's getting closer. However, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum value. This is my final offer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call!  Bob's offer is just slightly above my minimum value, and I'm tempted to go with John's guaranteed offer. However, a little more negotiation could be risky, and there's no guarantee I could do better.  I'm going to take the $15,200 offer from Bob. It's a decent price and avoids the risk of getting nothing if I try to counteroffer again."
