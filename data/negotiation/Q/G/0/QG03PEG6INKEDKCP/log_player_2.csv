"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and Alice is offering it at the same price, there is no benefit to buying from Alice. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for the same price, as there is no difference in price or value."
