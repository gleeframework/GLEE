Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product! I'm thinking $100 would be a fair price for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and open tone sets a positive foundation for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The message invites Bob to counter, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation. 

By doing this, I maximize my chances of getting a good price while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $80 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm signaling a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The phrase ""meet in the middle"" emphasizes the compromise aspect of my offer.

By offering $95, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that is both profitable for me and potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Close to Compromise:** While $85 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still not acceptable.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit, so I don't need to settle for a price that's too low. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to drop my price to $90. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price again, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fair Price Justification:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" by emphasizing the product's value, hoping to persuade Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"", encouraging Bob to respond. 

By offering $90, I'm trying to find a compromise point while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit vs. Time:**  While $85 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We've been negotiating for several rounds, and Bob's offers haven't moved much. There's a risk that we'll keep going back and forth without reaching a satisfactory agreement.
* **John's Guarantee:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed profit from John."
