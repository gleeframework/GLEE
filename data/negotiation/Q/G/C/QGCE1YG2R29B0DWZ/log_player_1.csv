Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has incentive to negotiate, knowing he can get the product for less than $1,500,000.
* **Maximizes potential gain:** This price gives me a good chance of securing a sale close to my minimum acceptable price, potentially even exceeding it if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Provides flexibility:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can still make counteroffers or walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I can potentially secure a higher price by making a counteroffer, or if that fails, I can always sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. By reducing my price slightly, I'm showing flexibility and increasing the chances of reaching a deal.  However, $1,400,000 is still above Bob's last offer, leaving room for him to counter again if he's willing to pay more. This strategy balances maximizing my potential gain with the need to reach an agreement before potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offers, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to accept a lower price than my ideal, but not that much lower. Given the uncertainty of Bob's willingness to negotiate further, it's a safer option to sell the product to John for my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
