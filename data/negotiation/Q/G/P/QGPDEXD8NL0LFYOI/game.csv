"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $750,000 is below its worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is more reasonable.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000.  How about $910,000?  This is my final offer.",910000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $880,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I think this price is more reasonable considering the value I'll get from the product.",880000.0,Bob,6,
