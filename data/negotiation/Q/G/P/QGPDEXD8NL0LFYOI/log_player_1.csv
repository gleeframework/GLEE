"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $750,000 is below its worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000.  How about $910,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 910000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm putting a little more pressure on Bob by stating this is my final offer.  I'm still above my minimum, but moving closer to his range.  This either gets him to close the deal or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $880,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I think this price is more reasonable considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob is unlikely to go above $900,000. Accepting his offer at $880,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum, and there's always the risk he walks away entirely if I push further."
