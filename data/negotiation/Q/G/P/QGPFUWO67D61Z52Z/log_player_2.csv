"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. While it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you place on the product.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
