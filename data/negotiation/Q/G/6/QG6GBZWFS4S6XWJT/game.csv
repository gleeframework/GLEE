"I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,800 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
