"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I've already offered $130, and you're asking me to go back to $125? I'm not willing to do that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum. I can do $128.",128.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I've already offered $128, and you're asking me to go back to $125 again. I'm not willing to do that. I'm going to make a final offer at $127. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",127.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $127. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $127, which would be $126. Would you be willing to accept that?",126.0,Bob,10,
