"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Would you be open to that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000? That's a good middle ground, and hopefully, we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
