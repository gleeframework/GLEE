"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $85. This product is high quality, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $90.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'll buy it right now.",90.0,Bob,4,
