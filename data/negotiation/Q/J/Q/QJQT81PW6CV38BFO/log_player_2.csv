"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You can try to get a better price from Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still aiming for a price lower than $135.  There's still room to negotiate, and you don't want to overpay.  You'll try a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $125. How about we split the difference and settle at $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we try $132? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, you've been able to negotiate the price down to $132, which is a decent price for you, and only slightly higher than what Alice is willing to sell it for. It's likely that Alice won't go lower, so you're better off accepting the offer and buying the product."
