"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to let you have this product for a one-time offer of $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great deal considering its value to me.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but $10,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is a compromise that benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to go to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get this deal done.",14000.0,Alice,5,
