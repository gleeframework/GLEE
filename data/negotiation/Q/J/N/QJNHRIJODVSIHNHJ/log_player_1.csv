"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  This offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts immediately, great! 
* **Establish a high starting point:**  This helps me maintain a strong position throughout the negotiation. 

I'm also aware of the time limit (10 rounds) and the safety net of selling to John for $800,000. This gives me confidence to push for a better price than that while remaining open to a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant improvement over John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have 8 rounds left, which gives me time to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $1,050,000. Here's the reasoning:

* **Middle Ground:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room to go up or down depending on Bob's response. 
* **Time Factor:** I want to avoid getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation, so this offer aims to move the process forward. 

This counteroffer keeps me closer to my desired outcome while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting close to my preferred price range.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price, and it's still significantly higher than selling to John."
