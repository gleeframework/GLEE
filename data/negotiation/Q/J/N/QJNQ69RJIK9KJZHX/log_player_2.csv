Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I see where you're coming from. $120 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you maybe do $95? That would really help me out."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105, and we can get the product for $100 from John.  While getting a deal with Alice would be ideal, we're reaching the point where further negotiation might not yield significant savings."
