"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as you value it at $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than selling to John for $1,000,000, it's still above your maximum value of $1,000,000.  You're better off rejecting the offer and buying from John to maximize your savings."
