Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with some negotiation.  I still have 9 rounds left to make a deal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,150,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially since we've already established a strong foundation for negotiation.  With 6 rounds left, I'm not desperate to sell to John yet."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure,  I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm only 4 rounds away from selling to John, but with each round, I'm learning more about Bob's negotiating style and I'm confident I can push him to a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. It's clear we're both trying to find the right price.  I'm going to make one final concession and offer $1,200,000.

Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is getting close to John's offer.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I'm worried that if I reject Bob's offer, he may lower it even further or walk away.  Since I only have two rounds left, I think it's safer to accept John's offer and secure the deal.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's still a good deal and guarantees me a substantial profit."
