"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product.",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $900,000. This price reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about we settle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $862,500. This feels like a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point.",862500.0,Bob,6,
