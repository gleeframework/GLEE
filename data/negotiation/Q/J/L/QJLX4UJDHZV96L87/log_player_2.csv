"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently worth $800000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. This is a significant discount from what I could get from another buyer. It's a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for a significantly lower price."
