# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for much cheaper."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for a much lower price, making John the better option at this point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. John offers the same product for a price that is well within Bob's budget."
