"Alice, $18,000 is way over my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
