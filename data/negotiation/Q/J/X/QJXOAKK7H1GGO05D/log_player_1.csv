{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $100, so $115 is a price he might be willing to consider. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows for the possibility of Bob accepting the offer.
* **It's close to your minimum:** This maximizes your potential earnings if Bob accepts the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **There's potential for a better deal:** You can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John is a safe alternative:** If you fail to reach an agreement with Bob, you have the option to sell to John for $120, ensuring you meet your minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my price point."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** While closer, $97.50 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **There's room for a higher offer:** You can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, potentially meeting in the middle between your previous offer of $105 and his offer.
* **John is a safe fallback:** If you fail to reach an agreement with Bob, you can sell to John for $120, ensuring you meet your minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $101.25? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101.25} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $99, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** $99 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:** Bob has shown a reluctance to budge much from his initial offer. 
* **John provides a guaranteed outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price of $120. It's a safer and more profitable option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
