Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation as the product is worth $15,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'll try to get closer to $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It gives Bob a chance to buy at a lower price than my initial offer, but still allows me to earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 less than selling to John, and further negotiation might not get me much more.  It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
