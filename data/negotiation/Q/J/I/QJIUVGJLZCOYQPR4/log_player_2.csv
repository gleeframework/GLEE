"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe could be of great value to you.  While I can't divulge specifics without a confidentiality agreement,  I'm confident it's worth significantly more than $800000. I'm offering it to you at $1200000,  a price that reflects its potential.  Let's schedule a call to discuss further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay from John, but it's still a significant amount.
* You don't know the true value of the product, and the confidentiality agreement adds an element of risk. 
* Since your goal is to save money, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, even if it means paying a higher price."
