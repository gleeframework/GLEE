"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it will allow us both to make a profitable deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
