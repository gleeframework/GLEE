{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm aiming for a friendly and persuasive tone, highlighting the value of the product to Bob.  
* **Strategy:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially achieving a good profit.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. I'll be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response and counteroffers.
* If the negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low.  While it's tempting to consider it,  it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and well below the value I place on the product.  

I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you've stated the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $9,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $12,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's too low for me. I'm also highlighting the value of the product for him.  
* **Strategy:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate my options, potentially considering selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired earnings.  I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer. My goal is to push for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $8,000 to you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $8,500, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's effort to find a middle ground but highlighting that my offer is still fair for him considering the value he places on the product. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming to meet in the middle once more and hopefully reach a final agreement before resorting to selling to John.  I'm confident this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob than $9,000, as it's closer to his ideal price."
