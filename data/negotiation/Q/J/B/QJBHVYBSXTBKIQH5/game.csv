"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you've stated the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $8,000 to you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",8500.0,Alice,5,
