"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price still represents a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
