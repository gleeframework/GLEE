"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $8800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and settle on $8600? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8800 was a good starting point, and I'm not willing to go down to $8600. How about we meet in the middle at $8700? Would that work for you?",8700.0,Alice,5,
