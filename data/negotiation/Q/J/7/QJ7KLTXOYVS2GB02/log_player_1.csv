Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target, I still think I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 102.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay under $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm running out of time, I still feel I can push for a better price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  If you really want this product, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $98 is very close to my minimum, but I only have two rounds left.  It's a risky gamble to hold out for more, and I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely. John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so it's the safest choice."
