"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum, you establish a strong anchor point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and give you more negotiating room. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the high price as justified by the product's ""unique features and potential.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement""  signals your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high final price.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move.  How you proceed will depend on Bob's counteroffers and your assessment of the situation in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price given its value.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation. You have eight rounds left, and Bob's counteroffer indicates a willingness to engage in the bargaining process.
* **John as a Backup:**  While selling to John guarantees your minimum, it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Bob in the remaining rounds. 

**Next Round Strategy:**  You should make a counteroffer significantly lower than your initial price but still above your minimum. The goal is to signal flexibility while guiding Bob towards a more agreeable price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While my initial offer reflected the product's full potential, I understand the need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents significant value for you while still recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is a substantial reduction from your initial price, signaling flexibility. However, it remains comfortably above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** You're still framing the price reduction as a concession while reinforcing the product's value.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to:
    * Move the negotiation closer to your desired price range.
    * Gauge Bob's willingness to increase his offer substantially.

**Note:** Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's next move. If his counteroffer is still too low, you'll need to decide how much further you're willing to compromise or whether to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm happy to pay $1,500,000.  This shows my seriousness about making a deal, but it's also the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches your minimum acceptable price. 
* **""Highest I Can Go"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests this is likely his final offer, and pushing for more might lead to him walking away.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  While you have rounds left, there's no assurance you could negotiate a significantly higher price with Bob. You risk him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiations.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at this point secures your minimum desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
