I'm still hoping to get a better price from Alice. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my initial offer, but I'm not willing to accept anything over $10,000.  I'll see if I can get Alice to come down further."

Alice's offer is still too high, and I don't want to risk another round of negotiation. I'm going to go with John's offer of $10,000. This is the best option for me at this point to ensure I get the product within my budget."
