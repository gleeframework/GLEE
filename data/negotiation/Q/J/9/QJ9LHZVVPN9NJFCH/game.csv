"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my maximum. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
