Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very useful."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $149 is a high starting point, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially letting you squeeze out a few more dollars. 
* **Appear Reasonable (Slightly):** By not going for the absolute maximum ($150), you might make Bob feel like there's a small deal to be had.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will outright reject this offer knowing the product is only worth $80 to him. However, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential profit."
