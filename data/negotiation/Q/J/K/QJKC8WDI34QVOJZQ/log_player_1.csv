Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in this product, but  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and he offered $1,050,000. I'm not going to settle for a deal this low right away, especially with more rounds left to negotiate. There is potential to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, given the value of this product.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched. How about we settle on $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Although $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds. There's a good chance that I can get a better price, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.
