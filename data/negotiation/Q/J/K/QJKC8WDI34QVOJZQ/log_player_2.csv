Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, given the value of this product.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched. How about we settle on $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500?  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I'd prefer to pay a little less, $1,087,500 is a reasonable price considering the product's worth to me and the potential of further negotiation.  I risk going back and forth with Alice and ending up buying from John for a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product within my budget."
