``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying ""open to negotiation,"" I show flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm not ready to settle at $125 yet.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and show that I'm determined to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Move:** My goal is to see if Bob is willing to budge further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, testing the waters to see if we can come to a final agreement.

```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $128 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  There's still room for improvement, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and showing my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Strategic Move:**  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point, aiming to find a compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.

**Moving Forward:**

In the next round, I'll offer a price slightly higher than $115. I'll aim for a price that allows for a modest profit for me while acknowledging Bob's budget limitations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about $120? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love this product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $120, which is right in the middle of our latest offers ($115 and $125). This shows a strong desire to find a compromise and close the deal.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum, but with only two rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal falling apart. It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John rather than potentially ending up with nothing. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and there's a higher risk that we won't reach an agreement.
* **Guaranteed Income:**  While $110 is better than $100, the certainty of selling to John provides peace of mind.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After several rounds, it's possible that the negotiation process is becoming tiring for both of us.  

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John allows me to secure a decent profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
