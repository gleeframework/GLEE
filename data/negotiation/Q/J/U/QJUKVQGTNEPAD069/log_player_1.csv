{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($120).
* **Starting offer:** Offering $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** This allows me to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and the possibility of needing to negotiate further.
* **Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under pressure to accept any offer below $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120 and far below my initial offer of $100. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows that he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. Rejecting it allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price.
* **John as a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** While I want to earn as much as possible, I'm willing to compromise slightly to reach a deal with Bob. 
* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $85 is halfway between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($65). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $85 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $120, so I'm not losing money.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** I'm still holding onto John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $75 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable value of $120.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll offer more in the next round, and I risk the possibility of him walking away completely. 
* **Time constraint:** While John is a reliable buyer,  negotiating with Bob could take longer, and I may want to finalize the deal sooner. 
* **Potential for additional profit:**  I can always try to negotiate a higher price with future buyers if I sell to Bob for $75.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision, considering the risks and potential for a reasonable profit."
