Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, the price John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for me.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is still higher than what Bob values the product at ($100), so it relies on him seeing potential value beyond that or the fear of missing out.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, I have the security of John's offer."
