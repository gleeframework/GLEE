Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. I think it's a fair compromise and still a great value for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $145, and it's better to secure the product at a slightly lower price than John's offer."
