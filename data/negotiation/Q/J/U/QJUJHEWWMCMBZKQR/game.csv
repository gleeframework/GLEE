"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,450,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise,  and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your willingness to find a solution, and I'm prepared to adjust my price slightly.  How about we settle at $1,225,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this deal through with you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
