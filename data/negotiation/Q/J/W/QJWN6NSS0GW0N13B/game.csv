"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $10500. This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $9500 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference again and go with $10000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's still significantly less than what I could get elsewhere.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to pay $9750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $10250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still a significant value for you. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10250. I'm willing to pay $9900 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $9900 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $10100, which is a compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  What do you say?",10100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept your offer.",9800.0,Bob,10,
