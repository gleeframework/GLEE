I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $12,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $11,500. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully will encourage Bob to come closer to my asking price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to get the feeling he's not serious about getting this product at a fair price. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, so I'm going to sell to him."
