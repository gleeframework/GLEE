Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to buy. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you with a margin if Bob rejects, and you can still sell to John for your minimum. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting while still protecting your own interests."
