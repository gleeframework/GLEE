"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is above your maximum budget of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have room to negotiate and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** You can always purchase from John, so there's no rush to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $100 offer is a significant discount from Alice's $120 offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation without immediately reaching your maximum price.
* **Still within your budget:** You're keeping the price below your $150 threshold."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While $130 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above your desired price range.
* **More room for negotiation:**  You've already shown willingness to negotiate and can likely secure a better price.
* **John remains a safe option:**  You have the option of buying from John for $150, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer of $100 and Alice's current offer of $130.
* **Testing the waters:** It shows your commitment to negotiation while giving Alice a chance to consider a price closer to your desired range.
* **Still within your budget:**  You're staying below your $150 limit."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above your desired price range, and you're approaching your maximum budget.
* **John is a viable option:**  You can purchase from John for $150, providing a safety net and negotiating leverage.
* **More negotiation is possible:**  You can still try to lower the price further.

This is a risky decision. You're pushing the limits of your budget and the rounds are running out.  It's a gamble to see if you can get Alice to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is your final attempt to get Alice to meet you halfway. You've already shown a willingness to compromise and are nearing your maximum budget. 
* **Small compromise:**  It's a small step up from your previous offer but still below Alice's last offer.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, you need to make a decisive move to get a deal.

This counteroffer is risky, as it's close to your maximum budget. However, you're hoping Alice will accept it to avoid potentially losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $140 is at your maximum budget, and there's no guarantee she'll lower it further.
* **Time is running out:** With only three rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high.
* **John is a safe haven:** You can secure the product from John for $150, ensuring you get it within your budget.

While it's disappointing to not get a better price, purchasing from John minimizes the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
