"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $5,000 is far below what I can accept, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000?  This price still offers you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price we both agree on.  $6,500 is still a bit too far below my minimum, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's go with $8,000. This price is a good balance for both of us, allowing you to get the product you want at a reasonable cost, while giving me a price I can accept.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other offers.",8000.0,Alice,5,
