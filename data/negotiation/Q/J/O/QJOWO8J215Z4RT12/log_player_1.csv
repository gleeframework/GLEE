Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  Aiming slightly lower gives Bob a good deal while still earning you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You acknowledge the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough to be attractive) and earns you $150,000 above your minimum.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if just John) adds a subtle pressure to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance, you might adjust the price slightly."
