"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $150. This is significantly more than you are willing to pay. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm aiming for a bit more than that. Would $130 be agreeable?

While $130 is closer to your target, it's still above your $100 limit. You can try to negotiate further."
