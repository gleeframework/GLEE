``` 
 
Alice's offer is a good start, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm aiming to get the price significantly lower. Starting with a counteroffer of $80 gives me room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am unable to match the price you've suggested, but I would like to extend an offer of $85 for the product. This is my best offer at this time.

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer slightly above my initial target to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm offering a price slightly above my target to show I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a good deal."
