"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $975000? This leaves a substantial profit for you and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close!  $960000 is still a bit too low for me, given the product's worth to you.  Let's settle this at $970000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This would leave you a significant profit margin.  What do you say?",970000.0,Alice,5,
