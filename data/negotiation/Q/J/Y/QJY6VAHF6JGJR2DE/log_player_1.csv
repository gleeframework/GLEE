Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming high is key to maximizing your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, giving you the best chance of securing a high sale price."
