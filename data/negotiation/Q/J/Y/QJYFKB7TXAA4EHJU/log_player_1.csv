Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both parties, starting significantly higher ($2,250,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense. 
* **Fallback Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, giving her leverage to aim high with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob might negotiate down. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still secure her minimum desired price with John."
