"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above the product's worth to you. You can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate with her or exploring other options."
