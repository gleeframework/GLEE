"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $6,000?  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is worth $6,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500, which would be $8,250. That's the lowest I can go.",8250.0,Alice,5,
