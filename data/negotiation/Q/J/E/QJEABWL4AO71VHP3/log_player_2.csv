Considering its immense value, we believe it's worth $900000. We are confident that this investment will pay off significantly for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her perceived value of $800,000. As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a low counteroffer forces Alice to consider a significant drop from her initial price. 
* **Justification:** I've acknowledged the product's value but highlighted the price as a barrier.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $700,000 is still above Alice's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we would like to propose an offer of $850000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:**  Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than my desired price range. I am aiming to purchase for less than $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** Alice has already reduced her price, showing she's willing to negotiate.  I'm confident that with more rounds, I can push her price down further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could buy from John for $1,500,000, I'm not willing to pay that much.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has the potential for significant savings."
