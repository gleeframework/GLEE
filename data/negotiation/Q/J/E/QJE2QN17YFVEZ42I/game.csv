,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $92.50 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $93.75? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",93.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $93.75. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",92.5,Bob,6,
