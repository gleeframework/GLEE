"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's intent to negotiate. It's a reasonable starting point for counteroffers, acknowledging the value of the product while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,100,000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push the price down, staying consistent with Bob's desire for a good deal. It's still a significant amount below Alice's last offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I still believe that this product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $1,200,000. While this is a better price than her previous counteroffers, Bob can still aim for a lower price.  He has already shown a willingness to pay $1,100,000, and there is still room to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite there at $1,200,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between their last offers. This counteroffer signals that he is serious about buying the product but still wants to save some money. It also positions him for a potential final round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,175,000. Let's see if we can find a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,150,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a good deal for Bob, as he'd be getting the product for significantly less than John's asking price of $1,500,000. With only three rounds remaining, it's a good idea to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
