Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly less than the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I can still get $80 from John if the negotiation fails, so I'm not taking a significant risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $88.  This is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but still a good deal for him considering he values it at $100. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while trying to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $80 and is only $3 less than my previous counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and me having to sell to John for $80 is not worth it."
