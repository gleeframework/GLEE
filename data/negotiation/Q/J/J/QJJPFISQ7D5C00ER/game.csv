"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to my budget. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  If you're serious about buying, this is the best offer I can make.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been tough but fair in this negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000 even though that cuts into my potential profit, I recognize the value of this product. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
