Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1,025,000.
