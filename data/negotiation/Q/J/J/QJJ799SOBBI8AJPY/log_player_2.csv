"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12750. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer of $13000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible.  $12,750 is still more than he wants to pay, so he should continue to negotiate. He's got plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $12,250? This is a fair price, considering my initial offer and the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12250. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $13,000. This is still better than buying from John for $15,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that he'll run out of rounds. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a good price, even if it's not the absolute lowest."
