"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12750. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer of $13000.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $12250? This is a fair price, considering my initial offer and the value of the product for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12250. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
