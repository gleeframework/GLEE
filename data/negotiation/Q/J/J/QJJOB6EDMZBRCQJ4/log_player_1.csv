Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the absolute minimum you'll accept â€“ $1,200,000 (because you can sell it to John at that price).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  He values the product at $800,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This exists between your reservation price and Bob's perceived value. Any price within this range could potentially work.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price as close to $1,200,000 as possible without alienating Bob completely.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I have a commitment to fulfill."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start high but within the ZOPA.
* **Time Constraint:**  The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency and discourages drawn-out negotiations.
* **Alternative Buyer (Implied):** By mentioning a ""commitment,"" you subtly signal that you have other options without revealing all your cards.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move.  Be prepared to potentially negotiate a bit, but don't go below your reservation price. 
* **Relationship:**  While your goal is to maximize profit, consider your long-term relationship with Bob if he's a valuable contact."
