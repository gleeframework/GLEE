I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is too far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that meets my minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
