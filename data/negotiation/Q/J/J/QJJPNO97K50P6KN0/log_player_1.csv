Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have a strong negotiating position. Starting high ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming closer to your guaranteed sale price.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though you don't explicitly state those benefits. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open to discussion, giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

**Important Note:** While you have a backup buyer, pushing Bob too hard could make him walk away. This offer balances a strong opening stance with the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
