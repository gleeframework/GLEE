"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
