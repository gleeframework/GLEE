"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice is offering it for $140, which is still more than your maximum budget. 
* While it's a better deal than John, it's not ideal. 
* Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate further with Alice or explore other options."
