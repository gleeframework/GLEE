"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice is offering a price below the product's value to Bob, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  I'm very serious about this product and want to make sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he knows he can get a better deal from John. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price, as she has already stated it's her lowest offer."
