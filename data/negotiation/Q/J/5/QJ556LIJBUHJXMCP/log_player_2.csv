"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her own value of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would be less profitable, as Bob could potentially get a better deal through negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and he knows that Alice's minimum acceptable price is likely to be higher than $1,200,000 (her value for the product).  Therefore, offering $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  This offer is close enough to Bob's maximum price that it could potentially be accepted by Alice, but it is still low enough to leave room for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, but it's still higher than Bob's maximum price. While it's tempting to buy from John, there's still room for negotiation with Alice. Bob can potentially achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John now would only be beneficial if there was a risk that the negotiation with Alice would fail or drag on for too long."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his maximum price while still leaving room for negotiation.  By increasing his counteroffer to $1,275,000, Bob shows that he's serious about buying the product but still wants to save as much money as possible. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate. If accepted, it would still leave Bob with a significant amount of money saved.  If rejected, it sets the stage for a potential deal in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now significantly higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  It is unlikely that further negotiation will result in a price that Bob is willing to pay.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget.  While there is a chance that Alice might lower her price in subsequent rounds, the risk of continuing negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer is too high."
