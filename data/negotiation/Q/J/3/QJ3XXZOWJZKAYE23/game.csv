"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I cannot agree to $1,025,000. I would like to propose $975,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a deal. While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for coming down to $1,000,000. While I respect your position, my maximum budget remains at $950,000. I would like to suggest a price of $960,000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",960000.0,Bob,6,
