**Reasoning:** Bob seems firmly anchored at $950,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to yield a price that's significantly better than his current offer. Accepting his offer of $960,000 would mean losing out on a substantial amount compared to John's guaranteed offer. John's offer of $1,200,000 is a sure thing and represents a significantly better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
