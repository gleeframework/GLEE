Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $95 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's more than Bob initially wanted to spend and still a good profit over my minimum. 
* **Avoids Risk:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing the sale to John altogether if I continue to haggle. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and effort that can be spent on other opportunities."
