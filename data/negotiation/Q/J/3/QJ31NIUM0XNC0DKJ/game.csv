"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about we settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
