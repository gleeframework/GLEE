,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at $90?,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",88.0,Bob,6,
