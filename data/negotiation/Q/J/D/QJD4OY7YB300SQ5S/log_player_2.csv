# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is fair for both of us and ensures we can both benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can continue to try and get a better price by making a counteroffer.  You're still well below your max price and don't want to risk buying from John for $1,000,000."
