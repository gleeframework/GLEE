"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to compromise too much on the price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being closer to your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also being closer to your budget.",925000.0,Alice,5,
