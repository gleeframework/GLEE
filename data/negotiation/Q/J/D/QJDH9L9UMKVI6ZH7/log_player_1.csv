Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I can likely get more if I keep negotiating. I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the better choice."

I'm going to sell to John. We're running out of rounds, and while I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Bob, it seems unlikely at this point. Selling to John is the most guaranteed way to get a price that's close to my minimum."
