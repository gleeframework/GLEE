"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:** You get the product for $90, saving $10 compared to John.
* **Buying from John:** You get the product for $100, but it's more expensive than Alice's offer.

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
