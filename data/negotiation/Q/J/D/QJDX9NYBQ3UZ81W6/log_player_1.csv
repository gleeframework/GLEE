Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100. Would you be able to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $100 matches John's standing offer, it's unlikely Bob will go any higher.  It's in my best interest to accept the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
