"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. After careful consideration, we are offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to respond promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and try to push Alice closer to his target price of $800,000. There are still several rounds left, and it's worth trying to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $875,000.  This price is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our business interests, I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $890,000. This price is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers, allowing for a satisfactory transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but $890,000 is still a bit more than he's willing to pay. He has several rounds left, and continuing the negotiation could lead to a lower price.  He has a backup option in John, so there's no rush to accept a price above his preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to increase my offer slightly to $880,000, but I'm firm on this price.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 880000}
