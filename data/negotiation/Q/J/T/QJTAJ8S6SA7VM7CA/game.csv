"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering the benefit you'll gain.  Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $950,000.  This would be a good compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $950,000 is getting closer.  However, I'm still committed to getting a fair price for my product.  Let's split the difference and settle at $975,000. This would be a win-win situation for both of us, allowing us to finalize this deal quickly.",975000.0,Alice,5,
