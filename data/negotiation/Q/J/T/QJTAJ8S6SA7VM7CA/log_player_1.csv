"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know its value is even higher. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value Bob will gain by accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than the $1,200,000 I initially offered, and I want to maximize my profits.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  I'm not willing to sell to John at this stage because I believe I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering the benefit you'll gain.  Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $950,000.  This would be a good compromise and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable threshold. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price and still secure a deal. I have 6 rounds remaining, so I can continue negotiating without risking too much. Selling to John would be a significant loss in potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $950,000 is getting closer.  However, I'm still committed to getting a fair price for my product.  Let's split the difference and settle at $975,000. This would be a win-win situation for both of us, allowing us to finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 975000}
