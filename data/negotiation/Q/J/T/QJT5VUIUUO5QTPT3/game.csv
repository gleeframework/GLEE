"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $8,250? This way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $8,250, so how about $7,625?",7625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,625 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $8,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $8,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000",7800.0,Bob,6,
