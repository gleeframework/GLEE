**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still far below the product's value to you and your walk-away price ($1,500,000 from John).  Bob's increases are incremental, and it's unlikely he'll reach a number acceptable to you within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees you achieve your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob not coming up high enough."
