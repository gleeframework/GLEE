"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $25000. I'm willing to pay up to $18000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $18000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $22000. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $19500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $19500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my own minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $21000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, $21000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $19000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",19000.0,Bob,6,
