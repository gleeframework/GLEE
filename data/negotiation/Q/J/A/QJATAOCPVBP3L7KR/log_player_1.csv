"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it. 
 
This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** By offering a high price, I can quickly determine if Bob is seriously interested in the product. 
* **Set the Upper Limit:**  This initial offer establishes the highest price point in the negotiation, potentially pushing Bob towards a lower counteroffer.
* **Start Strong:**  A bold initial offer can help establish a strong position from the outset."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you consider $8000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:**  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and doing so risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could take up valuable time that could be spent pursuing other sales opportunities.
* **Certainty:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, eliminating any uncertainty or risk.

**In summary:**  Accepting Bob's offer in this round is the most logical and profitable decision, given the information available."
