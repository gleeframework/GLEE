"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price. We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk of continuing to negotiate is outweighed by the potential reward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm applying a bit of pressure while still leaving room for Bob to come up slightly and meet a mutually agreeable price. This offer is still a significant gain over John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  My absolute maximum is $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering it's also your break-even point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met my absolute minimum price, which matches John's offer. There's no further room for negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will go higher. It's time to seal the deal."
