Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'll make a high but reasonable offer to test the waters.

{""product_price"": $2,000,000}

This offer is slightly above the minimum value I'm willing to accept, but still within a reasonable range. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $1,500,000. Since this is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer.
