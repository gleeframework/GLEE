"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a friendly and positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I know it's worth less than you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's important to remember that my minimum is $12,000. While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better offer from Bob.  I still have 8 rounds to get a deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which still gives you a great price for the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you meet me at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I've already rejected his offer before. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and moves things along quickly."
