"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. $1200000 is a good offer, but it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal on a truly valuable product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
