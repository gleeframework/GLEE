"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500?  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? Can you consider this revised offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
