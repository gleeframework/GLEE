"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and above Bob's perceived value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone sets a good foundation for the negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The price leaves room for both of us to compromise, and it's important to remember that I can always fall back to selling to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Bob is showing interest and has made a counteroffer, so there's still potential for us to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

I'm going to proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!  "", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price slightly, showing flexibility, but it's still above my minimum. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer, making it seem like a fair and reasonable compromise. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While he's getting closer, $140 is still below my $150 minimum.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  He's continuing to negotiate, so I'm going to continue to see if we can find a meeting point. 

I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and meet at $145?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us, which makes it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Finalizing the deal:** I'm suggesting that we finalize the deal if he accepts, creating a sense of urgency."
