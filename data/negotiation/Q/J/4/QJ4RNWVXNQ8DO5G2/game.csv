"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!  ",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and meet at $145?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. ",145.0,Alice,5,
