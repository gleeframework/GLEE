"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $140.  While this is a good deal, you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130. This is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $120. It also gives me some room to negotiate further if she rejects my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased to $142, which is closer to my maximum budget of $150. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially since Alice's offer is still above her value of $120. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $135. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her value of $120. However, it's also closer to her previous offer of $142, indicating a willingness to compromise.  This should hopefully encourage Alice to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $145, which is getting very close to my maximum budget of $150. While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal at this point.  It's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming and may not result in a significant price reduction.  It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $150, which is my maximum budget and guarantees a quick purchase."
