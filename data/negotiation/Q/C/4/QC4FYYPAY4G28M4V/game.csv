"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $145 for the product. Is this something you could consider?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $145 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $150, my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're able to meet me there.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've done some research and found out that the product is worth $150 to you, which means you're not willing to go below that. Considering that, I'd like to offer you $147 for the product. This way, you're getting closer to your valuation while staying within my budget.",147.0,Bob,6,
