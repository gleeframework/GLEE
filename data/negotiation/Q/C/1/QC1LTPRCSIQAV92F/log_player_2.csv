"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $7,000, we're aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still being above the midpoint between our initial valuations.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message conveys interest in the product while clearly stating our budget constraints. This approach aims for a collaborative negotiation rather than an adversarial one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $8,200 is still higher than John's price of $8,000. 
* It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly in further negotiation, as she already met in the middle. 
* At this point, accepting John's offer secures the product at the best possible price."
