Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Markup:** The offer of $1,750,000 represents a significant markup, aiming to capitalize on Bob's perceived value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed positively and suggests openness to discussion (""Let me know what you think""). This gives Bob a chance to counter-offer without feeling pressured. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you might adjust the price and message accordingly."
