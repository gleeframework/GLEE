{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for a win-win scenario.
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high might scare Bob off immediately. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
