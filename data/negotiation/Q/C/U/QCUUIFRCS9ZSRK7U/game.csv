"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still well below its true market value. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
