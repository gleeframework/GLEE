Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product. This allows for some room for negotiation, and I'm confident that he'll be willing to pay a little extra considering the product's value to him.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit while also being open to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering a price of $85. This is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to my own valuation of the product. I'm hoping this will be an acceptable compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price,  $80 is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with my value for the product.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the deal with Bob."
