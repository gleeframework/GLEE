"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to consider my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",825000.0,Bob,4,
