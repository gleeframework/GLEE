"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features and benefits,"" I aim to subtly emphasize the product's value, potentially justifying the high initial price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I want to signal to Bob that I'm willing to have a conversation and potentially adjust the price.  This encourages him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to consider my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. While his message hints at budget constraints, it's likely a negotiation tactic. Rejecting this offer allows you to counter and work towards a more favorable price. You have John as a safety net, so there's room to push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating it's too low. This reinforces your position and the product's value.
* **Compromise (Apparent, Not Actual):**  Offering to ""meet in the middle"" sounds appealing, but $925,000 is still a strong price point, considerably higher than his offer. 
* **No Further Concessions (Yet):**  By making a substantial jump from his offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a good price and not willing to easily concede large amounts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now increased his offer to $825,000, which is above your minimum acceptable price and a reasonable profit.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, continuing carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now secures a good profit without dragging out the negotiation process and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to Bob. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $800,000, but securing $25,000 more is a good outcome."
