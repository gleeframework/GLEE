"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but to be honest, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a more reasonable price point for me and still allows you to make a decent margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
