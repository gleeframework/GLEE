Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone in your position, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle on a price significantly higher than your $800,000 backup.
* **Strong but Polite Language:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob while remaining polite and open to discussion."
