"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700000 is unfortunately below my minimum value.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about $900000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $900000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",850000.0,Bob,4,
