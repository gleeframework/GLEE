Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's better to secure the product from John at $80 than to risk Alice increasing her price or the negotiation stalling further."
