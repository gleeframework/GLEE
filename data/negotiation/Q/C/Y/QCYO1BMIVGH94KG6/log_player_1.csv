Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects a fair return on the value it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Room to Negotiate:** Starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) leaves space for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance Alice can secure a price well above her minimum. 
* **Confident Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique nature"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing Alice's true bottom line.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the initial offer and subsequent negotiations fail, she can still sell the product for her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If he's known for walking away from high prices, a more moderate starting point might be wiser. 
* **Market Information:** If Alice had more information about the market or Bob's urgency to buy, she could adjust her offer accordingly."
