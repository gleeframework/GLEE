Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can come up with a fair price for both of us. How about $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $140.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 140}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $135. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $135 is a good price, and it's getting close to my ideal price.  There's always a risk he'll reject my next counteroffer and I'll end up with the lower price from John."
