"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I value the product, $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a good deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'd agree.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However, $9,100 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer you $8,800 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to acquire the product within my financial means.",8800.0,Bob,6,
