Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent with you, I have a standing offer for $1,000,000 from another buyer.  However, I believe in finding the right match for this product, and I'm confident it will be more valuable to you in the long run.  So, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 as my final offer. This gives you a significant advantage over the other buyer and reflects my commitment to making this deal happen.
