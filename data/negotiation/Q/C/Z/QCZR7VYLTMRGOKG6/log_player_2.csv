"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Given the value to me and your desired price point, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  At $900,000, Alice's offer is still cheaper than buying from John.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already compromised, and Bob's previous offer was rejected.  Further negotiation might result in a stalemate or Alice walking away.
* **Value for Bob:** Even at $900,000, Bob is still getting a significant discount from his maximum budget and a good deal overall."
