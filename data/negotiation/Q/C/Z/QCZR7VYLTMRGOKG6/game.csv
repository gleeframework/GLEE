"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Given the value to me and your desired price point, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
