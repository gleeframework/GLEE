Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal for something worth so much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth will help Bob understand the potential benefits.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 more rounds to explore potential higher prices.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but there's a chance I can get more from Bob with continued negotiation.

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer, to encourage further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and I'll come down to $900,000? It's still a fantastic deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Motivation:** Offering a middle ground encourages Bob to think seriously about accepting.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Space:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial offer, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **Risk Management:**  Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but continuing negotiations could lead to a better outcome.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** With several rounds remaining, there's still a possibility to secure a price closer to my desired range.

```

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the final round, and I have no room to negotiate further.

* **Guaranteed Income:**  Selling to John guarantees a secure income of $800,000, eliminating any uncertainty.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to take the risk of potentially getting nothing if he rejects my counteroffer.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit, even if it's slightly less than I initially hoped for."
