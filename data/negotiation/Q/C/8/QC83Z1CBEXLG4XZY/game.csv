"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and land at $837,500? ",837500.0,Alice,5,
