"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,300,000. Let's see if we can make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John.  There's always the risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings are not worth the added risk at this point."
