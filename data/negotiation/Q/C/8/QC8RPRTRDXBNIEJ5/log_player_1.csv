Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while ensuring a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""market worth,"" the message subtly suggests the price is justified, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **John as Backup:** Having John guarantees at least $800,000, giving us leverage to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit from Bob while having a safety net with John."
