I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but hopefully, it will also pique Bob's interest and encourage him to make a counteroffer.  If he doesn't, I can always go with John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take $1,000,000, it's less than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer but represents a significant drop from my initial price. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about selling the product and encourage him to come up with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in risking a further rejection or negotiating with him, especially since John is also willing to pay the same amount.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
