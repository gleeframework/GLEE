Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it meets my minimum value, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,400,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,250,000, which is above my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer more, continuing to negotiate with Bob might risk him walking away completely.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
