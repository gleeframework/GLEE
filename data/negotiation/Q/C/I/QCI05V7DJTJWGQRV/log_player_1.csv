{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him, and I'm still getting a significant profit over my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is still a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to earn a decent profit while hopefully encouraging Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $128 is still above my minimum, it's getting too close to the price John is offering. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 132}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $132. I'm willing to go a little lower to secure the deal, but I'm not going to drop below $130 at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. At this point, I'm better off selling the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed sale and while it's not my ideal price, it's still more than my minimum."
