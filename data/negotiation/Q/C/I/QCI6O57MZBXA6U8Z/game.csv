"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $12,000?  This would still give you a great deal on a fantastic product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
