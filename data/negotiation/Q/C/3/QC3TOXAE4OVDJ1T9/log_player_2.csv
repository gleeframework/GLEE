"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than John's price, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is a bit lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $110 is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  There is still a chance to reach a price that is more favorable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $115.  This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. It is still a good deal for Bob as it is lower than Alice's offer and is still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within Bob's budget and is lower than the price from John. Although Bob would prefer a lower price, the negotiation seems to be stalled. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further rounds of negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or a deal falling through entirely."
