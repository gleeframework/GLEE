"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** You're aiming for a price closer to $800,000, and $850,000 is only $50,000 higher.
* **You have limited rounds left.** With 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers and potentially end up buying from John at a higher price.

**Next Steps:** You've accepted the offer and purchased the product from Alice."
