"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $875,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the potential for a quick and clean transaction.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
