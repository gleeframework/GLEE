"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $925,000 is less than what John is selling it for, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable margin for both of us. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to adjust my price somewhat, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $880,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price of $850,000.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob losing the product to John."
