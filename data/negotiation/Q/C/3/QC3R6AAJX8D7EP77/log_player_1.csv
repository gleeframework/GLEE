Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high.  A starting price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Confident but not greedy:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value without appearing overly aggressive.  
* **Alternative in mind:** While you hope Bob accepts, you're prepared to sell to John if needed, ensuring you meet your minimum price."
