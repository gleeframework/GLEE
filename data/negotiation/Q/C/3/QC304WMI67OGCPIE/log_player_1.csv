Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing my profit slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest likely profit."
