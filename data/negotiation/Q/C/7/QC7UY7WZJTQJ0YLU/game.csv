"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while also acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
