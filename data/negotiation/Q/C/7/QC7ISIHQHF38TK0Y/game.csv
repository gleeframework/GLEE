"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my financial limits. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $860,000 for the product. This still provides a decent profit for you while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,
