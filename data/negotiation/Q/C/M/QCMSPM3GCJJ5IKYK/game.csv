"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground, what do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
