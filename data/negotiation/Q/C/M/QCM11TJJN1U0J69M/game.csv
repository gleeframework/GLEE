"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,500.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while still being within my financial constraints.  What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. However, $12,500 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I think we can meet in the middle again at $12,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
