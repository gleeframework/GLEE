Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired value. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $12,000, so I have a safety net if Bob doesn't agree to a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and I believe there is room for a more mutually beneficial deal. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $15,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but shows that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I've already tried to compromise, and at this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. It's better to sell to John for $12,000 and ensure I get at least my minimum."
