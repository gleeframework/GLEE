"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay, and there's no indication that Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows me to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A million dollars is a substantial drop from her initial offer, and it might encourage her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. It's also a good middle ground between my previous offer and her latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my target price and, with only 5 rounds left, it's a good deal.  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate might result in Alice getting more stubborn and potentially pushing the price back up."
