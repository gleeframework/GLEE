"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, $1,050,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit while offering you a competitive price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still aiming to stay within a tighter budget, but I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,075,000.
