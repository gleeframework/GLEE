"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  While it's below the product's worth to her, it's still above your desired price point. 
* **Negotiation potential exists.**  There's room to push for a lower price, potentially saving you a significant amount. 
* **Buying from John is a safety net.**  Knowing you have a guaranteed option at $1,200,000 gives you leverage to negotiate more aggressively with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I see the value in this product. However, I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate hard.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the lower price, focusing on budget limitations. This keeps the conversation amicable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While it's a big jump, there's still room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving too much away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, $1,050,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit while offering you a competitive price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your goal:**  While Alice has come down, the offer is still $100,000 above your ideal price point. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Both parties have shown flexibility, suggesting there's still potential to reach a more favorable agreement. 
* **John is the backstop:** You can always purchase from John if you can't reach a better deal with Alice. This leverage allows you to push for a lower price without the fear of losing the opportunity entirely.

**Next Move:** You should send a counteroffer closer to your target price, but still reasonable enough to avoid losing Alice's interest. Consider offering $1,075,000, showcasing your willingness to compromise but also maintaining a firm stance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still aiming to stay within a tighter budget, but I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,075,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you receive a reasonable price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being within your preferred range.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the compromise aspect and the fairness of the proposed price. 
* **Finality:** The message suggests a desire to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Alice to accept or make a final counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

This counteroffer strategically positions you to potentially close the deal or, if Alice rejects, pushes the negotiation to a final stage where you might have to either accept her final offer or move to John."
