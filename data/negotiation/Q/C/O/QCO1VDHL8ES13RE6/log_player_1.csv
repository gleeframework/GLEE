Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,250,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,350,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1,300,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my expenses. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer from him.  Selling to John would be ideal, but it's a risk to wait. I'll accept Bob's offer."
