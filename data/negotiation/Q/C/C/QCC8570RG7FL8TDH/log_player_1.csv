"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $150 to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message can help build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counteroffer, which is likely to happen in this scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$110 is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $100, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **John is a fallback option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $100 gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $110 doesn't quite cover my costs. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $120? It's still a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $110 and my previous offer of $130. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:**  I'm not willing to go any lower than $120, but I'm still keeping the offer open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to pay $115 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited rounds:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer:** While John is a safe option,  $115 is a better deal, and I'm likely to get a higher price if I continue negotiating, but it's not guaranteed.  

It's better to take a slightly lower offer than risk losing the sale altogether."
