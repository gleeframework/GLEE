Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.

This is my final offer in this range, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be fair.  However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
