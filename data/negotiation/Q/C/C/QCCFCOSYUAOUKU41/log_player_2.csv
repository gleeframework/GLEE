"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's target. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for Alice to come down further. By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation going and might be able to secure an even better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be fair.  However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $875,000. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll make a small adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $912,500. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. While there's still a possibility of negotiation, the rounds are getting limited and there's a risk of Alice getting more stubborn or the negotiation taking longer. Given the option to buy from John for a guaranteed $800,000, it's the safest and most financially beneficial decision for Bob to take. It ensures that he acquires the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation risks."
