"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm offering it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($120). There's room for negotiation to save some money. You can try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the price point, but I'm hoping to get it a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above the product's worth to her. This leaves room for negotiation while demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above the product's worth to her ($120), and you have room to negotiate further.  You can try to push for a lower price in the next round. While John is a backup option at $150,  you should continue trying to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $135.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved from $145 to $140, showing she's willing to negotiate. By reiterating your previous offer of $135, you're showing consistency and demonstrating that you're serious about closing the deal. This also sets the stage for potential compromises or a final round where you might accept something closer to her offer."
