"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. This product holds immense value to me and I believe it could be equally beneficial for you. Given its significance, I am offering it to you for $12,000. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the intrinsic value I place on it. I understand its worth to you might be $10,000, but I hope you'll consider the additional benefits and the opportunity it presents. I look forward to your positive response. Best regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no need to spend the extra $2,000 if you can avoid it. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed to purchase from John at your desired price."
