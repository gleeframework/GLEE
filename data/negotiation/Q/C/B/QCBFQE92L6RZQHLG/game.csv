"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's start with this offer and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interest to close the deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $950,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product. I believe it's a fair price and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you're meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's find a way to make this work before we lose this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $975,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product. I believe it's a fair price and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",975000.0,Alice,7,
