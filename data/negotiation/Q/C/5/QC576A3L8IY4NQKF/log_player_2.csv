While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price."

Alice is being stubborn and won't come down to my target price. I've already made several counteroffers, and she's not budging.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John.  While I'd prefer to get it for less, John's offer is within my budget and I don't want to risk Alice continuing to push for a higher price."
