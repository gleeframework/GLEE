"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value and my target profit margin.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $16,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $14,000, which is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, Bob. It's a price that I'm comfortable with and still reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not going any lower.",15000.0,Alice,5,
