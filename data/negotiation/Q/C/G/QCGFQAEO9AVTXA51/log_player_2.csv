"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits, and I'm confident this price reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above Alice's minimum.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering your minimum and my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating his serious intent to negotiate. It's still above Alice's minimum, leaving room for a potential compromise. The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly to $1,100,000, but Bob can still potentially do better.  He has a budget of $1,200,000 and there are still 7 rounds left.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by proposing a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that he's serious about finding a middle ground. The message remains friendly and emphasizes the possibility of a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000 as a final compromise.  This is still a great value for you, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is getting closer to Bob's desired price.  However, with 5 rounds left, Bob still has room to negotiate. He should try to get a lower price, especially since he has the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,090,000, but I'm still looking for a better deal.  I'm offering $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1080000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by proposing a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that he's serious about finding a middle ground and willing to compromise. The message remains friendly and emphasizes the possibility of a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,080,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,085,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,085,000, which is very close to Bob's last offer of $1,080,000.  With only three rounds left, it's a good time to accept the offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially considering the option of buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and saves him $115,000 compared to buying from John."
