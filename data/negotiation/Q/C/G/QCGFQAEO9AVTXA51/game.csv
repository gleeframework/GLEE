"Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering your minimum and my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000 as a final compromise.  This is still a great value for you, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,080,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,085,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
