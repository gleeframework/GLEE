"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is top-of-the-line, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,
