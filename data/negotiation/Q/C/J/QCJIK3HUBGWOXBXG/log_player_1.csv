Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $110 is still higher than $80, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You are still above your minimum of $120, leaving room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It shows flexibility:**  You are open to negotiation, indicating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum selling price of $120. It's too low for me to consider accepting at this point.  I'll reject his offer and try to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too far below what I'm able to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident this price will still give you a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price and will try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $75. It's simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm trying to be fair here, and I think this price is a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}
