Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay that amount if you're open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I can only offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of the product and the fact that we're both eager to reach a deal. Let's see if we can close this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. I'm happy to see we're making progress, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  Given my budget limitations, I can only offer $1,350,000.  Let's find a way to bridge the remaining gap and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a strong deal. It surpasses my minimum by $150,000 and avoids the risk of negotiations stalling or Bob walking away.  It's always possible to get more, but this represents a significant gain and closes the deal efficiently."
