Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it represents a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thought.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $20,000 allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still staying well above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. 

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, you might adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's worth engaging in further negotiation to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is my initial asking price, I understand that might be high for your budget. Could you consider $16,000?  I'm motivated to find a good home for this product."", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** Coming down by $4,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price significantly above both Bob's offer and your absolute minimum.
* **Gauging Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product. If he's unwilling to budge much from $8,000, it might be time to consider John's offer.
* **Positive Language:**  Maintaining a positive and understanding tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm ready to pay $10,000, which is the highest I can go. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Furthermore, his statement that ""$10,000 is the highest I can go"" could be a negotiating tactic, and there might be some wiggle room.  It's strategical to counter-offer again before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and your honesty about your budget.  I'm very motivated to sell, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this work. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you're creating a sense of urgency and signaling that you're firm on this price. 
* **Compromise:**  You've come down in price again, demonstrating a willingness to make a deal.  $13,000 is a significant compromise on your part but still keeps you above your absolute minimum. 
* **Midpoint:** Offering a price that represents the midpoint between your previous offer and his suggests fairness and might be more appealing.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000, ensuring you don't make a loss."
