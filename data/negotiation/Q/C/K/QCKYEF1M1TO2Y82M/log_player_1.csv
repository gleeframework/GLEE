Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm happy to consider offers in the range of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land on a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating my minimum, I imply the product's value by mentioning it's ""worth a significant amount."" This creates a perceived higher value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""happy to consider offers in the range of..."", I signal flexibility while still anchoring the starting point at $20,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that I have another buyer (John) is strategically kept hidden. Revealing this information might weaken my negotiating position.

This approach aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
