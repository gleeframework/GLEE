"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $17000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $17000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get great value from the product.  Let me know what you think!",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference at $17750?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good price for your product.",17750.0,Bob,4,
