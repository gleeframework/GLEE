Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $14,000 is a strong starting point, there might be room to negotiate slightly higher if Bob counters.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than his perceived value increases the likelihood of Bob accepting immediately. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) while avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing me to sell to John."
