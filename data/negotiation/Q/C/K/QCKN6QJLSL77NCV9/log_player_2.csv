"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that offers significant value to both of us. While I have another potential buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You can save $200,000 by going with John."
