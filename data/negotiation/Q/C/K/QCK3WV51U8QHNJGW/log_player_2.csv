{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  I'll start with a counteroffer in the next round."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to keep my maximum budget in mind.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Is this something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer of $13,500 is still above my budget. I believe there's still room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can close the deal closer to my desired price.  I'll send another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm prepared to offer $13,000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our negotiation history."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise at $14,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation history. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $14,250 is still too high for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement within my budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for $8,000, as it's the most cost-effective option."
