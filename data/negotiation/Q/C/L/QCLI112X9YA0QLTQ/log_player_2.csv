"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still more than Alice's valuation of $12,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Bob is offering $13,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $14,000. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and offers a middle ground between his maximum willingness to pay and Alice's likely minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  It is also very close to what Bob would pay for the product from John. It makes sense for Bob to reject this offer and continue negotiating, as there is still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $13,500. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.  It's important to remember that Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, but he also needs to avoid pushing Alice away entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is the same as what Bob could buy the product for from John.  There's no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice at this point, as there's no potential to save any money. It's best for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John."
