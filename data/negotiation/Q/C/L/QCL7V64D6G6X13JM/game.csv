"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  I can tell this is important to you. How about we split the difference and close at $13,000? ",13000.0,Bob,6,
