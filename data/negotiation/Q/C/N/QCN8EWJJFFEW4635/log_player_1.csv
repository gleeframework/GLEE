Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to aim slightly below that to incentivize Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $149 makes it seem like a deal compared to your ""backup plan"" while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct, mentions the price upfront, and subtly implies value. 
 
**Important Note:** While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. This strategy balances risk and reward."
