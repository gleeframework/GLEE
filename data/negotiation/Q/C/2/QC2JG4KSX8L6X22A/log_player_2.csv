"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $140 is close to our budget, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This approach leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of Alice's valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However, $130 is still above our ideal price. Let's see if we can get her closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're proposing a price that's exactly Alice's valuation of the product.  This is a strong negotiating position â€“ it's a fair offer that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I need to make a little more profit. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $125 is a good compromise. It's close to her valuation and well within our budget. Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price closer to John's offer."
