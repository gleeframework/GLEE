"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1000000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still above his budget. Since he can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get her to come down even more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still going to have to counter with $1,050,000.  I'm really close to my budget limit, but I do believe this product has a lot of value for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're close to your budget limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to his ideal price, he's already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and Alice is firm on her price. It's not worth risking further negotiation when he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and save $75,000."
