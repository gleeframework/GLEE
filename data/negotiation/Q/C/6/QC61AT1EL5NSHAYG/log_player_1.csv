"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I want to see if I can push for a bit more in the next round before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $13,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already made several concessions and it seems unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum.  To ensure I get a price that's worth it to me, I'm going to sell the product to John."
