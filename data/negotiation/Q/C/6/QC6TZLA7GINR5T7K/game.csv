"Alice, your offer is a good starting point. However, based on my research and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value you place on the product while also allowing me to make a significant investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
