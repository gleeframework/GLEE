"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $1,200,000 by you. I am willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an asset that holds significant value to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counteroffer process and potentially save more money."

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In light of our discussions, I would like to propose a revised price of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product to both of us. I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or further lowering her offer is present. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a good price."
