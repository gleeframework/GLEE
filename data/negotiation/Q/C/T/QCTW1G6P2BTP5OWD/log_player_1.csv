"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value for your business. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000.  While I value the product highly myself, I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get a deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can always sell to John for $800,000 if a better deal with Bob doesn't materialize. It's worth continuing the negotiation in hopes of getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $850,000?  This would still leave a significant margin for you while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $775000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price of $800,000 or higher. I have 6 rounds remaining, so I'm not in a rush to accept an offer that's not truly profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $812,500.  This would allow me to get closer to my minimum price while still providing you with a significant discount from your initial value of $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to $750000. How about $785000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is becoming more flexible, his offer of $785,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Bob is diminishing.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, it's the best option to secure a deal and avoid further risk of a stalemate or a lower price."
