"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good starting point,  Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is getting closer, Bob can still save money.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target price. It's still early in the negotiation process, and there's room for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see that you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down to $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, $11,250 is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject the next counteroffer and the price might go back up. Also, there's always the chance Alice will decide to sell to John instead. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's well within Bob's budget and saves him from the potential of paying John's much higher price."
