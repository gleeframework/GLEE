Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations with Bob significantly above his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for anything less than John's offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential returns""  attempts to frame the price within Bob's mind, even if he doesn't perceive the same inherent value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while staying comfortably above your minimum.  It also creates the impression that you're willing to negotiate fairly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong position because you have a backup buyer, but aim to find a price that works for both of you."
