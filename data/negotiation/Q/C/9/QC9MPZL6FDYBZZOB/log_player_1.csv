"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  This price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's a starting point. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can push for a higher offer.  I believe Bob is still motivated to buy, and I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a strong profit margin. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise that might encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'm starting to consider selling to John if the negotiation continues to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time by a smaller amount. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm still holding firm on my desired profit.  I believe this price is enticing enough for Bob, while still allowing me to make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a difficult decision. While I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer and me having to sell to John for $1,000,000 is becoming too high.  $975,000 is a very good price, and I can't afford to risk losing out on that much profit.  It's time to close the deal."
