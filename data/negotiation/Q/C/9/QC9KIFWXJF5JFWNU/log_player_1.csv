Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  $20,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:** Mentioning being open to negotiation makes Bob feel like he has some control and might be more inclined to engage. 
* **Positive tone:** Keeping the tone friendly and encouraging makes the initial offer less intimidating.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a favorable position while leaving room to adjust the price if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable. Remember, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can come up with a fair price of $18000 for it. I hope this proposal suits your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  $18,000 is not a bad price, but it's still below my ideal outcome.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's a chance I can get closer to my desired $20,000 if I continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, there's a good chance I can get more from Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While $18,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by referencing Bob's previous offer.
* **Middle Ground:** $19,000 is a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's last offer.

This approach keeps the negotiation going while increasing my chances of getting a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $18500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is close to my target:** $18,500 is only $500 away from my initial target of $19,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  Pushing for a higher price might risk Bob backing out completely.
* **Time is a factor:** Continued negotiations could take longer, and I might be able to secure a quicker sale with Bob.

Given that Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and his offer is reasonably close to my ideal price, accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point."
