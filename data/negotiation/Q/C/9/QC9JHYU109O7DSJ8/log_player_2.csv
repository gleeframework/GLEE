"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's a good idea to start by rejecting Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is still way too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Let's start with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is still a significant amount for me, but it's a fair starting point given my budget and the fact that Alice is likely to want to negotiate a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. We're getting closer to my target price, but there's room to negotiate further.  Let's see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Let's increase our offer to $900,000. This is still within my budget and a reasonable jump from the previous offer. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my target price, it's still above my ideal range.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice for a better deal. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I won't go over $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000, which is my absolute maximum. If Alice doesn't accept this, I'll go with John's offer to ensure I don't exceed my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut our losses. We've tried to negotiate with Alice, but she's not budging on her price. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option for me at this point.  I'm saving $225,000 compared to Alice's latest offer, and it's within my budget."
