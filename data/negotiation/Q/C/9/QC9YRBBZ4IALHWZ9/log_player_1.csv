"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediate rejection.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect, aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good price while still allowing me to profit. 
* **Open-ended question:** The question encourages Bob to engage and allows for potential counteroffers.

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming for the best possible price, I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the alternative buyer John. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting Bob's offer now gives me more leverage to push for a better price.
* **Evaluating John's offer:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'm not rushing into it yet. There's a possibility of getting closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  I'll also consider the remaining rounds and John's offer as factors in my decision-making."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's price while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message stresses the ""fair price"" and ""mutual benefit"" aspects, trying to make the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Continued negotiation:** The open-ended question keeps the negotiation going and invites Bob to respond. 

**Factors considered:**

* **Remaining rounds:** I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time for negotiation.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm still trying to maximize my profit with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response in the next round and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation opportunity:** I have 6 rounds left, which is still enough time to try and secure a higher price.

* **Focus on fairness:** The message emphasizes ""fair deal"" and ""value of the product,"" further appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  While offering a compromise, I'm still not accepting his offer, indicating that I'm not desperate and willing to continue negotiating.

**Factors considered:**

* **Remaining rounds:**  I have 5 rounds remaining, providing ample time for a successful negotiation.
* **John's offer:**  While still attractive, I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price with Bob before resorting to John.

* **Negotiation opportunity:** I have 4 rounds left, which gives me a good chance to push for a higher price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to counter with an offer of $927,500 for your product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 2 rounds left, the chances of getting a significantly higher offer from Bob are diminishing.
* **Minimal gain:** Accepting Bob's offer at $927,500 would only result in a small gain compared to selling to John.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer guarantees a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

**Conclusion:**

While I've tried to negotiate with Bob, the remaining time and potential for a substantial increase in price are too low to justify risking a deal with John.  Selling to John at this point ensures a guaranteed profit and eliminates any further risk."
