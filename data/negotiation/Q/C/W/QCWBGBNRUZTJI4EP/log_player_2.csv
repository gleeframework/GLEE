# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
