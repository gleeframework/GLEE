"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I have to say that $12000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
