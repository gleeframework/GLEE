"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120, but I'm also aware that he may try to negotiate lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by demonstrating flexibility, I can encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85.  While it's above my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round.  I have a few more rounds before I have to consider selling to John, so I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $90 again.  This is the middle ground between our last two offers, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept it.  We're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $80. Bob's offer of $82 is only slightly better than John's offer, and I'm running out of time. It's more likely that Bob will continue to offer prices lower than $80, which would be below my minimum. It's better to secure a deal with John and ensure a profit."
