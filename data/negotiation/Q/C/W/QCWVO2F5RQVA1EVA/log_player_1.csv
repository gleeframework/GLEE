Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth even more than Bob's estimated value. 
* **Alternative:**  By mentioning listing it ""publicly,"" Alice hints at other potential buyers, subtly pressuring Bob to make a decision.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Alice has the security of John's offer, ensuring she won't be forced to accept anything below her minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for Bob to counter-offer."
