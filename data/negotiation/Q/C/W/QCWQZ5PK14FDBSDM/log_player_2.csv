(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Max:** You are willing to spend $10,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $9,500.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but you can still get the product for your max price from John, it's better to **reject Alice's offer** and see if you can negotiate further with her or buy from John."
