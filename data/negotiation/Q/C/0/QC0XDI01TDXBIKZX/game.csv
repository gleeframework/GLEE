"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its potential. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to recover a significant portion of the value of this unique product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go a little further and meet you at $925,000.  This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $900,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,6,
