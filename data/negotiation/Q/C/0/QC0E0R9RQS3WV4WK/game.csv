"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects the value I know this product holds for any serious buyer.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but that price is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer considering I could go with another seller.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  Let's be transparent.  I've already received a standing offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer. However, I value our initial discussions and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, knowing you have another offer at $1,500,000 makes $1,900,000 hard to accept.  I can do $1,100,000, but that's my absolute best.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
