Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and shows you're serious about getting the product. It also leaves room for negotiation, as you suggest finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $9,000 is still a bit too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, and seeing if you can get a better price.  You have 7 rounds left to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000. However, I'm still looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Perhaps we can split the difference and settle on $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her offer and your previous offer.  It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However,  $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $8,900 is a very good price for you, considering your target of $10,000.  You have already rejected two offers, and continuing to negotiate might risk Alice getting frustrated and pulling back her offer.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
