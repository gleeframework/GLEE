"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $1,400,000.  While it's less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This offer still gives you a substantial value for the product and allows me to secure a fair price. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial $1,400,000 offer to $1,300,000. This is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000. While there's always the possibility of pushing for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
