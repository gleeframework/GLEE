Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his maximum valuation is $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Above Minimum:** The price is still significantly above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring a good profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $10,000 if Bob refuses."
