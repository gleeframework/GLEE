"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $8,500? I believe this price is fair and gives us both a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $8,500 is closer, but still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,250.  This price is very close to my minimum, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,
