Alice's offer is still quite high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit closer to $8,000."

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're now only $250 away from John's price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
