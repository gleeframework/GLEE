"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming up to $10,500. To be honest, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be to sell. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,750? It's a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
