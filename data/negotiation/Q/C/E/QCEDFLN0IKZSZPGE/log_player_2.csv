"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $13,000.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $10,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000. This demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves a profit margin for Alice.  It's a good compromise that benefits both parties, and Bob should accept it.  Further negotiation might get a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and Bob ending up with a higher price from John is not worth the potential savings."
