"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I believe this price might be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still leaving me with a good profit."

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $12,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing continued flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This might be a sweet spot for Bob to accept, as it's a significant increase from his last offer and a good price for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. With only four rounds left, the risk of selling to John for $10,000 is increasing. However, I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11,750}
```

With only three rounds remaining, I'm willing to lower my counteroffer slightly to $11,750. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to close the deal, while still securing a profit higher than my minimum.  I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's only slightly lower than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for such a small profit, especially with only two rounds remaining.  I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer one last time to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11,250}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,250. I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that we are down to the last round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum. However, with only one round left, I can't risk another rejection and potentially end up with nothing.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a profit, although it's not ideal. I need to secure the sale and move on."
