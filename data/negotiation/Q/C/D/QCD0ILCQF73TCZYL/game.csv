"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $850,000? It's a price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $775,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  While $775,000 is still a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that considers your budget while still acknowledging the product's value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
