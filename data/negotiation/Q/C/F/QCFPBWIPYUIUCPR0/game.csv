"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm currently willing to pay. I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $850000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go to $875000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900000.
