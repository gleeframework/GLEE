"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $150. Would you like to accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $125.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $125 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to pay $110 for the product.  This seems like a fair deal considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $100. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round. I believe there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $115 is still a bit too high.  I'm ready to pay $110, and I believe this is a fair price given our previous discussions. Would you be willing to accept this offer?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. Considering our previous negotiations, I am willing to accept $112 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. I hope this meets your expectations. Would you like to accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is still above my maximum budget of $100. While we're getting closer, the negotiation is taking longer than expected, and I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds.  It's more efficient to buy the product from John at $100 and avoid further negotiation."
