"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $125. This is still a bit above your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Would you like to accept this offer?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $125 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to pay $110 for the product.  This seems like a fair deal considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",110.0,Bob,4,
