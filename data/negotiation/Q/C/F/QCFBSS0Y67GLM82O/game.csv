"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I have a budget to stick to.  I can offer $1,150,000. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This takes into account both the value of the product to you and the fact that I need to make a profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can feel it! How about we split the difference and settle at $1,200,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
