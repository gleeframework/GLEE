"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
