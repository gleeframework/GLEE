Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" aims to justify the high asking price.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Objective:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. By starting high, there's room for negotiation downward while still remaining well above John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
