"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to him and $80 to me. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I'm still making a profit.  It's also only the second round, so I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
