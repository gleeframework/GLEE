Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
