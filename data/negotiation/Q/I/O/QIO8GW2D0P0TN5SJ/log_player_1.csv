"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value to me is significantly higher than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $10,500.  This feels like a fair compromise, given your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
We are already very close to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not yield significantly better results. Accepting $10,500 is a reasonable outcome in this scenario."
