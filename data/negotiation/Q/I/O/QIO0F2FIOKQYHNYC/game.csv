"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a chance to get a great deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $14,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14,500? This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
