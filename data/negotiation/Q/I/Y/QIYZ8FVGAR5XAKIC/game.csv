"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product, and $12,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the value I bring to the table.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle,  how about $14,000?  This is a fair price that considers both of our interests.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to your target, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $15,500. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while also reflecting the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
