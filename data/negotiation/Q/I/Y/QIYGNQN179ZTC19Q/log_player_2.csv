Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $925,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still significantly above John's price. Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price Bob is willing to accept. It's time to cut losses and buy from John for the guaranteed best price."
