"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While the product sounds intriguing, $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value I've put into it, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1150000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I truly believe this product has potential, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I need to consider the potential for future growth and returns. I'm going to counteroffer at $1200000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
