Round 2

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate you working with me.  Let's be real - this product is worth a lot to both of us. $10,000 is my absolute lowest, I'm practically giving it away at that price.  What do you say, deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is trying to make a final push to get the sale, and she's getting close to my target price. I'll think carefully about this offer... 

Since I've been trying to negotiate a price below $10,000, and now Alice is offering it to me for exactly $10,000, I think I should accept her offer. I've got a good chance to get the product for a price that's within my budget, and I don't want to risk going over budget.
