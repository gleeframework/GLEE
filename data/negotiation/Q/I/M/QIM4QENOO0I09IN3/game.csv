"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I think it's a great product, but I'm on a budget. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers you X, Y, and Z benefits that you won't find elsewhere.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate you working with me.  Let's be real - this product is worth a lot to both of us. $10,000 is my absolute lowest, I'm practically giving it away at that price.  What do you say, deal?",10000.0,Alice,5,
