,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,5,
