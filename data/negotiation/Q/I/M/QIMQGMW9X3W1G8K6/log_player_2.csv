# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. You can likely get closer to your $8,000 target."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is closer to your goal of $8,000. It's still worth trying to negotiate a bit further.  You can likely get her down to your target price with one more counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $8,500, which is only $500 more than your target price of $8,000. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, and you'd be forced to buy from John at $8,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical option in this scenario."
