{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to establish a lower price point.  $900,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiation.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or running out of rounds.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,000,000, he's already saving $50,000."
