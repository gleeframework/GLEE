"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. It's above your $10,000 limit.
* There's no reason to immediately buy from John, as you still have negotiation rounds with Alice. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer,  $4,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my serious interest in buying but also sets a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  While $9,000 is below my limit, it's still above Alice's valuation, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is within my budget of $10,000. 
* **Good Compromise:** This is a good compromise from Alice's previous offer of $13,000 and my counter-offer of $9,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my counteroffer or I'll run out of rounds.  Accepting now secures the product within my budget."
