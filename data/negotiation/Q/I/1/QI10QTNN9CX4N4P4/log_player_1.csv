Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing him to a rejection. 
* **Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net, but the aim is to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price of $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above the $10,000 fallback."
