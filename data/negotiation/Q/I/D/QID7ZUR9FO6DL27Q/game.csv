"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I have to make a profit too. How about we meet in the middle, but from my perspective? I'll offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $105. I think this is a fair price that lets both of us get a good deal.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're really eager to get the product, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we meet at $115? It's a bit more than my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
