{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  It also leaves room for me to potentially accept a counter-offer from Bob if he's willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $130.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher than $130. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that he will walk away entirely.  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome and the best option at this point."
