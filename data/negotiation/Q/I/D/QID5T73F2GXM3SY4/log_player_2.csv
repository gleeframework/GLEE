"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant step closer to your value. This allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can close this gap."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is now the same as her initial offer. We've gone back and forth, and further negotiation might not yield a better price. Accepting this offer is a good deal, saving us $300,000 compared to John's price."
