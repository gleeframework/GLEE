"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2 million) because Bob has a high perceived value for the product ($800,000).  This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Building Rapport:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in conversation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob to further justify the price.

**Strategy:**

My aim is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged.  Starting high allows me to gauge his willingness to negotiate and potentially land a price closer to my minimum desired amount ($1,500,000).  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind the value to me and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product to you, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. How about we set the product price at $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to compromise, indicating a potential deal closer to my desired range. 
* **Value to Me:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating because the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price while still remaining profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,700,000. This reflects the value it brings to you, while still allowing me a fair profit. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,700,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer ($2,000,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while remaining above my minimum price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, justifying the price and encouraging him to see it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and keeping Bob engaged. If Bob rejects, I'll further adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, constantly striving to maximize my profit while remaining within the bounds of my minimum price and the remaining negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement. I am willing to consider $1600000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a profit close to what I could get from selling to John.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of reaching a stalemate or running out of time.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I keep rejecting offers, there is a chance that Bob will walk away or his counteroffers will continue to decrease, leading to a lower final price.

**Strategy:**

While I would ideally prefer to sell for closer to $1,700,000, accepting this offer ensures a secure profit and minimizes the risk of ending the negotiation with a lower price or losing Bob as a buyer. It's a calculated risk that prioritizes a good outcome over pushing for the maximum possible price."
