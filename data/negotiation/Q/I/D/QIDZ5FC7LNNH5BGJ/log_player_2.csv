"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its quality and features. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know I can buy the product from John for $120, I'll go with the safe option and buy from John. There's no benefit to me to negotiate with Alice at this point, as I'm not sure of the product's value to her and her willingness to lower the price."
