"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment. I also want to leave some room for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I believe I can get closer to that number through further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me and hopefully close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to significantly drop my price. My goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I believe I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating. There are still 6 rounds left, and I can afford to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I am confident I can close the deal at a better price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm dropping the price slightly from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise. This price is still above Bob's last offer, but it indicates that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution. I believe this counteroffer has a good chance of being accepted, especially considering the limited number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there is no guarantee that we will reach a deal within the remaining rounds.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I can guarantee a sale with him. It's a better strategy to sell to John and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob."
