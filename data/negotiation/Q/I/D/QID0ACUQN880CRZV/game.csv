"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. This price reflects the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a mutually beneficial deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
