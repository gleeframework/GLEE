"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $9,500? That would work much better for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can offer you a compromise at $11,000. This is a fair price that should meet your budget and still provide a good return for me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but still a tough sell for me. How about we split the difference and call it $10,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can offer you a slight concession at $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
