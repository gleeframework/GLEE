"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your flexibility, Alice.  I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  Would you consider $7,500?  That would be a comfortable price point for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to the price I'm looking for. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to get at least $9,500 to make it worth my while. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Alice,5,
