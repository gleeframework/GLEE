"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's significant room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000), I'm aiming to establish a negotiation range that's more favorable to me. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial low offer gives me space to gradually increase my bid if needed while staying well below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This first counteroffer will help me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.  Her response will guide my next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has moved closer to your budget, $9,000 is still more expensive than buying from John. There's still room for negotiation, and you haven't reached your maximum price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your flexibility, Alice.  I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  Would you consider $7,500?  That would be a comfortable price point for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $7,500, signaling to Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price.
* **Staying Below Maximum:** This counteroffer is still safely below my $8,000 maximum, leaving some room for potential further negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests Alice's willingness to go below $8,000, which would be ideal. Her response will determine my next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to the price I'm looking for. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to get at least $9,500 to make it worth my while. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging significantly from her position.  Her latest offer of $9,500 is even higher than her previous offer of $9,000.  It's clear that she's unlikely to go as low as your $8,000 maximum or close to it.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000."
