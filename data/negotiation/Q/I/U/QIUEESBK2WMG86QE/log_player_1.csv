Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. It's definitely worth it, and I'm sure you'll love it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and upbeat, aiming to create a positive impression on Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm suggesting the product is ""definitely worth it"" to entice Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my minimum value of $120 and the potential sale to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I'm going to hold out and try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value, aiming to get as close to $120 as possible without risking losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me cover my costs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason for my counteroffer, explaining that $130 allows me to cover my costs. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have a successful negotiation!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're not comfortable with that, I can always just go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I've already come down significantly, and I'm not comfortable going any lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $120, which guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
