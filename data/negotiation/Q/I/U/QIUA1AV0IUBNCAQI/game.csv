"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,200. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without breaking my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,5,
