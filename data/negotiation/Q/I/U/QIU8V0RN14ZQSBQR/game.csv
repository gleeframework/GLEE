"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,175,000 is closer, we're still a bit apart.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this price fair considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
