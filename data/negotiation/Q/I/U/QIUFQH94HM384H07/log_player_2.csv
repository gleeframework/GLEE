"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $14,000 is above his maximum budget. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500,  which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10500. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  Since Bob is focused on saving as much money as possible, he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11750. This is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. While the offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not a good deal.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $10,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $11,250, which represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $11250 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While they are getting closer to a potential agreement, Bob has already gone through six rounds of negotiation and there are only four rounds remaining.  The risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing, and the time pressure is building. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, Bob should take the sure thing and purchase the product from John.  He will save $1,500 compared to Alice's latest offer and secure the product without further negotiation."
