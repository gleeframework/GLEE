"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You have a significant buffer before needing to resort to John's offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high. You can likely get a better price with further negotiation. It's worth trying another counteroffer before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $1,025,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,025,000 is still well within your budget. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price changes, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is high.  It's a good compromise to accept the offer and secure the product."
