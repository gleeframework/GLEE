"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $1,025,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
