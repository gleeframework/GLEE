"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a good starting point for negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Let's meet in the middle at $975000. This price still offers you a good deal while ensuring I can achieve a fair return. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about $925000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a bit closer to my initial offer of $900000.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $925000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $950000. This price acknowledges your commitment to finding a compromise while still allowing me to achieve a fair return.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $925000 to $950000, so how about $937500? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",937500.0,Bob,6,
