Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's worth a considerable amount to you, and I believe it's a valuable asset you'll find beneficial.  I'm confident that the price of $1,050,000 reflects its value and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to capitalize on his interest.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's worth to Bob, suggesting a win-win situation.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $1,050,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum requirement. 

This approach aims to kickstart a negotiation while establishing a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 

This approach allows me to try and bridge the gap and potentially reach a more favorable price than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This price still offers you a good deal while ensuring I can achieve a fair return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Interest:** I'm starting with a positive tone to maintain a good rapport.
* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appeal to Compromise:**  I'm using language like ""middle ground"" to suggest that this is a reasonable compromise. 

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable price while still protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about $925000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a bit closer to my initial offer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the price I'd like to achieve.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  It's worth trying to squeeze out a bit more money, as I'm already close to my minimum acceptable price.  

**My next counteroffer will be carefully considered, taking into account the following:**

* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  He's shown that he's willing to move a little on his price.
* **My minimum acceptable price:** I need to make sure I'm not dropping below this point.
* **My potential for a better deal with John:** If negotiations fall apart, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $925,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $950,000. This price acknowledges your commitment to finding a compromise while still allowing me to achieve a fair return.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Compromise:** I'm emphasizing Bob's desire for a deal and my willingness to compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of his last offer and my previous counteroffer. This presents a clear path towards an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the price as a ""win-win scenario"" to encourage acceptance. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that is fair to both parties and potentially closes the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $925000 to $950000, so how about $937500? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I'm realizing that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. 

While it's not the ideal outcome, it ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoid potentially further reducing the price.  John is a reliable buyer, and the transaction will be smooth."
