"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time. Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $18000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I can only go as high as $14000. Would you be willing to consider that offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about getting this product, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think it's a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $16000 is still stretching my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $14000. This is the best I can do.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to finalize the deal. ",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $15500, which is still a compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your need to make a profit, but $15500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,8,
