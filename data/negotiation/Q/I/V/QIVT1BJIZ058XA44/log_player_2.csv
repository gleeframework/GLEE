"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $25,000 is far above my budget of $10,000. It's not a reasonable starting point. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $25,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know if that's a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but also have limitations.  I've kept my message polite and open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $18000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. Alice's offer shows she's willing to negotiate, which is encouraging. I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I can only go as high as $14,000. Would you be willing to consider that offer?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $14,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Alice's offer of $18,000. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise. I'm also reiterating my budget constraints to emphasize my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about getting this product, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think it's a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my budget. While I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer, I'm not willing to go beyond $14,000 at this point. I'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to my desired price. There are still 5 rounds left, so I have time to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $16,000 is still stretching my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $14,000. This is the best I can do.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my counteroffer of $14,000, emphasizing that it's my best possible offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also have a hard limit. I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $15500, which is still a compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still a bit higher than my preferred price.  While she's getting closer to my counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject her offer and try to get her down to $14,000.  I have 3 rounds left, so I can afford to be a little more firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your need to make a profit, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reiterating my offer of $14,000, emphasizing that it's my final offer. I'm also hinting at the possibility of buying from John, adding pressure on Alice. With only two rounds left, it's time to see if we can close the deal."
