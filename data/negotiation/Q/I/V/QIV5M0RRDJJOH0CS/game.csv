"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking that $850000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your target, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $860000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $860000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $880000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $855000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",855000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $860000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. Let's meet at $860000 and finalize the deal.",860000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, but I'm still not willing to pay $860000. I'm willing to meet you at $840000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",840000.0,Bob,10,
