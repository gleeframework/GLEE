Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of $14,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his desired price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if a more favorable price can be reached."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
