"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still below your valuation and allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. How about we settle on $975,000? That's a reasonable compromise, wouldn't you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to budge. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This price still allows me to make a profit, but it also brings us closer to a deal.  Let's finalize this.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
