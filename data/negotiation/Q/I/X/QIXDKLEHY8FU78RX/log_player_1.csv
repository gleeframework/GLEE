"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  My initial price is $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial price. How about $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not sure how much Bob values the product, and there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $9,000? I believe this is still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? How about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise and is getting closer to my desired price point. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who would pay $8,000,  taking $8,500 from Bob ensures a higher profit and closes the deal sooner."
