Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150) to leave some room for negotiation. This offer is also within Bob's range, as he values the product at $100, making it potentially attractive to him.  I'll see if he bites, and if not, I'll be ready to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested but I can only offer $125 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $125 is well below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I'm really interested in this product and think this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'm going to make one final counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
