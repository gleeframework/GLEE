"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is way beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering I'm still willing to make a significant investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its unique value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1200000. It's a fair price given the value I place on the product. If you're truly interested in selling, let's find a way to bridge this gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $1200000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1600000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair value of the product. Let's finalize this deal before we both lose time.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1700000.
