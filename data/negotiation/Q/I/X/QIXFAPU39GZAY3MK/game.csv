"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $12500, and I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services to sweeten the deal?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the additional services you're offering, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we meet at $12250? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12250.0,Bob,6,
