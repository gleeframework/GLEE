"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Accepting Alice's offer at $14,000 is better than buying from John at $15,000, but there's still room for improvement.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially lowering the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he'll start by offering a price that's closer to his ideal price than Alice's offer. 
* $13,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer, as it's halfway between Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and Alice's asking price of $14,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also puts pressure on her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer and closer to his ideal price. 
* Buying from Alice at $13,500 saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal and there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers."
