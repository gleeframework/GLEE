"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $12,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum budget of $15,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,750 is a good deal and closer to my desired price, I still have some wiggle room. I want to see if I can push for an even lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high with $11,750.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? This is the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, but I'm getting closer. I can do $11,500. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good price for me and still below my maximum budget of $15,000.  I've already rejected a few offers, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
