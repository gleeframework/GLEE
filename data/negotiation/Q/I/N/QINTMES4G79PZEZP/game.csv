"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
