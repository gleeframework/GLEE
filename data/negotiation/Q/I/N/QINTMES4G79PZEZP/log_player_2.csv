"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's asking price ($15,000) and my own budget ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to bargain.
* **Polite and Interested:** I'm maintaining a polite and interested tone to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Alice to continue the conversation. 
* **Strategic:** I'm aiming low to potentially secure a great deal.  Even if Alice rejects my initial offer, I have room to negotiate upwards without exceeding my $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is closer to her valuation, but still significantly above my $10,000 limit and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's room to move the price down further. I'll continue to counteroffer strategically. 
* **Backup Option:** I can always rely on John's offer if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I've increased my offer to $9,500, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but not ready to meet her halfway point. 
* **Staying Below Budget:** This counteroffer keeps me well within my $10,000 budget, leaving room for a potential final compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will gauge if Alice is genuinely interested in finding a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice's latest offer of $11,500 is still above my $10,000 limit. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Her language suggests this is likely her best price, and she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which saves me $1,500 compared to Alice's final offer. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with from John."
