"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your price point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
