``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's value for the product, giving him a reason to consider it.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer. Remember, I can always sell to John for $10,000 if Bob doesn't come around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your price point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what John is offering.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on the sale altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the desired $10,000."
