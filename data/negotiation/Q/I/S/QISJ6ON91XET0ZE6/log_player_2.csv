"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm confident that you'll find this price competitive and reasonable considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, or alternatively, buy from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, as she has lowered her price from $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My new counteroffer is $1,025,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He's already been negotiating for a while, and the price hasn't dropped to his desired $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John, guaranteeing a price of $1,000,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
