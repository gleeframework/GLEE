"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of getting a good price while still being within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer to see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $835,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 835000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  $835,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $815,000 for the product.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $815,000 is getting close, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  If I reject his offer, he might counter with an even lower price, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a good price and avoids the risk of getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation."
