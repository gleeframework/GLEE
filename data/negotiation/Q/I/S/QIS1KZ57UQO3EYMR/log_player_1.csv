Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  By starting high, I establish a strong initial position. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay a premium.
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. It's too risky to accept such a drastic reduction in my profit.  I'd rather keep negotiating with Bob. 
* **Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer of $1,500,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate but I am also not desperate to sell. I am aiming for a price that is closer to my initial offer but still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob accepts this offer, I will be happy to sell him the product. However, I am prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it, but I will keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and not particularly profitable. 
* **Reasoning:**  At this point, I've already made significant concessions.  Further negotiation is likely to be lengthy and I'm not sure I can achieve a price that justifies the time and effort.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and less stressful. 
* **Next Steps:** Selling to John provides a secure and reasonably profitable outcome. I'll move on from negotiating with Bob and finalize the deal with John."
