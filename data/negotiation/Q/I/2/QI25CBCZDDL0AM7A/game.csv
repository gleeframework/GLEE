"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $11,750 for the product. It's a fair price, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,
