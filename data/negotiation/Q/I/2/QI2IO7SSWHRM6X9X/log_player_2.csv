"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's initial offer is $130.  It's worth rejecting this offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $100.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's really my bottom line. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $95 is a better price than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have a reliable alternative with John who is selling the product for $80.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
