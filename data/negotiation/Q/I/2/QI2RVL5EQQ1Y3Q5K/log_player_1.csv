Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $13,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still only able to offer $10,000.  This is a fair price considering I'm willing to pay more than John's offer.  Let's seal the deal.

Bob is bluffing. He knows John is offering $12,000, yet he is still trying to lowball you.  It's clear Bob is unlikely to come up significantly from $10,000.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
