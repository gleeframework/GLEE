"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I can't accept $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $800,000.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you a price of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $800,000.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you're firm on the value this product brings.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still not willing to settle at $600,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $675,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $800,000.",675000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been a tough negotiator. I respect that you're sticking to a price you believe is fair. To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to go up to $615,000. Hopefully, this can get us to a deal.",615000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $615,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $680,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $800,000.",680000.0,Alice,9,
