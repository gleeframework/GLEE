You can do better than $120.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down further."

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for a potential compromise while still staying within your budget."

While I'd prefer a lower price,  $130 is a reasonable compromise and still under my budget.  It's better than buying from John for $150."
