"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $800000 to me. I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a significant discount from its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested. I'm eager to discuss the details with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price ($900,000 vs $1,500,000).  Even if the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice, it's still a good deal for Bob.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $600,000."
