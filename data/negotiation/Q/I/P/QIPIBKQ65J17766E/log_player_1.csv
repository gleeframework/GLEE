Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's still significantly less than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $110 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum value and allows me to close the deal quickly.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer."
