"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high. Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $750,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $850,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  He should continue negotiating to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to your target price, but I'm not ready to accept $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825,000 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not his ideal price, it's a good deal considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price, and there's a risk that Alice might walk away from the deal entirely.  This offer saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
