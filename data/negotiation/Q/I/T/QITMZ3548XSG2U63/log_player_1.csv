Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position but $750,000 is simply too low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
