"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for me to potentially lower the price if needed. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately.  I'll see how Bob reacts and proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is my floor price, as I can sell to John for that amount. I'm hoping Bob will come up to this price, or at least get closer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and counter with a higher price in the next round. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my floor price. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but also that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my floor price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I still need to get a price closer to my floor price. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my floor price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer.  If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go any lower.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
