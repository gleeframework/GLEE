You can likely get a better price from Alice. It's worth trying a counteroffer to see if she'll go lower."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my target.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a decent price. It's a good deal compared to John's price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will result in a lower price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point."
