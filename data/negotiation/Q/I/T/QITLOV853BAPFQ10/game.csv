"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair return for me.  Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
