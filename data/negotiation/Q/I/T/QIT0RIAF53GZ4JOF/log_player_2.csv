"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I am extending this opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive offer tailored specifically for you, and it won't be available to others. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget ($10,000).** Even though it's a ""special introductory price,"" it's not worth it to you.
* **You can get the product for a lower price from John.**  While John's price is your maximum, it's still better than Alice's offer."
