"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on something closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I have to say that $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a personalized consultation to ensure you get the most out of the product. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the extras you've included, they're definitely valuable. However, my budget is firm, and to be honest, $1,200,000 is just beyond my limit.  If you're willing to consider $1,000,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000, and I'm throwing in a 10-year warranty, a personalized consultation, and a free upgrade to a premium package. This is my last chance to get a better price, so I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
