Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $82.50 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $85.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for a potential gain of $2.50.  I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John."
