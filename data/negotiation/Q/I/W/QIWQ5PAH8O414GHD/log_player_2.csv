"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's always worth trying to get a better deal, especially since you have 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. While $110 is still above my target, I'm not ready to buy yet. I'll try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to come down to $105? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I can offer you a deal at $108, which is my best price for now. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is close to my target price of $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John for $150 is high. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price."
