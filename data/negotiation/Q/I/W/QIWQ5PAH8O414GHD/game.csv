"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to come down to $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I can offer you a deal at $108, which is my best price for now. Let me know if that works for you.",108.0,Alice,5,
