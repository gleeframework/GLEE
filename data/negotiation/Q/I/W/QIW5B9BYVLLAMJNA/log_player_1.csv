Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive) while securing you a $20 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob's purchase while maximizing your potential earnings."
