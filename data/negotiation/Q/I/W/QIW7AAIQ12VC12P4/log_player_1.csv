Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I believe it's a great deal at $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is only worth $100 to Bob, I need to offer a price that gives him some perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't go below $120. 

By offering the product at $115, I'm giving Bob a chance to save $5 and potentially securing a profit of $15. If he rejects, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
