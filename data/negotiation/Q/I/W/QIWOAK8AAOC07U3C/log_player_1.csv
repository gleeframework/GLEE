Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about $125? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly agree on $122 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to counteroffer."
