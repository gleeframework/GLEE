"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Would you be willing to accept that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. This is my final offer.",98.0,Bob,6,
