**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm making a significant concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can secure a lower price.  If we can't reach an agreement in the next few rounds, I'll consider buying from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a substantial compromise from my previous offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'm getting closer to my limit as well. I need to make a living, and I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us. This is my final concession, and I'm counting on you to meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above my budget and I'm not sure if I can get her lower. Considering I only have three rounds left, it's probably better to secure the product from John at $800,000.  While I would have liked to get a slightly lower price, the certainty of getting the product at a reasonable price is valuable."
