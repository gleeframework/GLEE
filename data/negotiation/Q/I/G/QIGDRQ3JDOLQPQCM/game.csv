"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
