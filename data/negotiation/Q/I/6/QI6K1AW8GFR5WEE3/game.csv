,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $10,250. It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. How about $10,000 even? That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,6,
