,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $90 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between the value you place on it and my asking price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $87.  Let's try to make this work.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue discussing this. Considering your latest offer, I would like to suggest a price of $89 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you see in it.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $89 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to do $88 for the product?  That way we both get a good deal.",88.0,Bob,6,
