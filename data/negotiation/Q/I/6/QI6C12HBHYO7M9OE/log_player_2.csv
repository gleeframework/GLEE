"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $115 is still above my target price. I'll try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
``` 

I'm continuing to negotiate, incrementally increasing my offer but staying below my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but also serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $107 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $111.  I think that's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably in price, and $111 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from Alice, and it's better than buying from John for $120."
