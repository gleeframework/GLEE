"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
