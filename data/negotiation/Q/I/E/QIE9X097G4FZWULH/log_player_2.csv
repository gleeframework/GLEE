"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm still trying to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $7,250 is a good deal. It's lower than John's price and it's a reasonable compromise.  Accepting this offer saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
