Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my means.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to settle for a loss, and I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $980,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I only have 4 rounds left.  I need to secure the deal quickly. I'm not sure if I can reach a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and I'd rather not risk losing the opportunity entirely."
