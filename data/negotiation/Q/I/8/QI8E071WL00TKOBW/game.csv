"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $975,000.  This would be a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking $920,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Bob,6,,
