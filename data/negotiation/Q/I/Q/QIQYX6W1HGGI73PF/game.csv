"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm hopeful we can find an agreeable price point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
