Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are too far below my bottom line.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
