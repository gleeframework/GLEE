Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can get at least my minimum desired price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is considerably below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to keep the focus on its worth.
* **Negotiation Focus:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, creating a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,300,000 is a good midpoint, giving room for further negotiation while remaining above Bob's offer.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap, keeping the negotiation alive while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,175,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to settle for a price that is too low. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my asking price.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,275,000. This offer is fair and gives you a great opportunity to own this valuable product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasizing Value:** The message reiterates the value of the product, reminding Bob that the price is justified.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""great opportunity"" and ""mutually beneficial"" to keep the negotiation amicable.
