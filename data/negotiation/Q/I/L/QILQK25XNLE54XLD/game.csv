"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
