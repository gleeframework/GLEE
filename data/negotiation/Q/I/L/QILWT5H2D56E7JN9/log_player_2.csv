"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is below Bob's maximum, it's still not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $105 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his counteroffer with a price that's closer to his maximum of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation. Offering $105 shows that he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $110?  That leaves room for some negotiation, and I'm confident this product is worth it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum.  While $110 is closer to Bob's maximum, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's also worth noting that Alice seems willing to negotiate, as she lowered her price from $115 to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still interested, but $110 is a bit high for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating flexibility by meeting Alice halfway.  Offering $107.50 shows that he's willing to compromise while still trying to keep the price below his maximum. This counteroffer also keeps the negotiations moving towards a possible agreement."
