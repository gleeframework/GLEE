Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message includes a phrase about a ""special introductory price"" to provide a reason for the high initial offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also communicating that I value the product highly. 

I'll closely observe Bob's response to decide my next move. If he outright rejects the offer, I know I need to come down. If he counteroffers, I can assess how much he's willing to pay. I'll keep in mind my alternative offer from John ($100) throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any price. I'll aim for a counteroffer that meets me closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've lowered my price from $120 to $110, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum. This strategy aims to create a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and nudge Bob towards a deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer positions me favorably. If Bob accepts, I exceed my minimum. If he rejects and offers closer to $100, I'm in a strong position to either accept or leverage my offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Would $100 be acceptable for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price of $100. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation or selling to John, as both options yield the same profit. Accepting Bob's offer closes the deal swiftly and ensures I receive my desired earnings."
