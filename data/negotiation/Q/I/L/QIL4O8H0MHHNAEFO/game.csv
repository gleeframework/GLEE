"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you working with me.  However, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $115. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $112.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
