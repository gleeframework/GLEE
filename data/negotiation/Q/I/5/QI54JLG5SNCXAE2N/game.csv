"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects both its worth and my willingness to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  If that works for you, we have a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
