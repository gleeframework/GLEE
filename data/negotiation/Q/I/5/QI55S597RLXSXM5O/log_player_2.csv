"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $22,000, which reflects the true value of this item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's ample room for negotiation, so rejecting and providing a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $22,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Lower:** We start significantly lower than Alice's asking price but well above John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling a serious interest if the price is right.
* **Justification:** We provide a reason for the lower counteroffer without revealing our absolute maximum budget. 
* **Positivity:**  We maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $18,000 is still considerably higher than both your target price and John's offer. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counter. $18,000 is still a bit higher than I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer from $10,000 to $12,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly below Alice's price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's latest price.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and avoids any ambiguity about our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference again. Would $15,000 work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down significantly, $15,000 is still above your target price and equal to her perceived value.  You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your ideal price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows Alice you're willing to compromise but still want a price closer to your target.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** $13,000 puts you within a potentially agreeable range while still leaving room for a final concession if needed.
* **Clear Objective:** The message reinforces your desire for a fair deal and that $13,000 achieves that."
