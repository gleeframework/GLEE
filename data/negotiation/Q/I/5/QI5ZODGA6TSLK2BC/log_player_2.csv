"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save money.  Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to spend.  Since John is also selling for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer means you can still get the product for the same price.  This strategy leaves open the possibility that Alice might lower her price if you reject her initial offer."
