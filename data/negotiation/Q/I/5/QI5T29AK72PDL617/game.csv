"Alice,  $20,000 is far above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
