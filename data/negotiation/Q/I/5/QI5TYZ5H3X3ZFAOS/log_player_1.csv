Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price exorbitantly high (e.g., $300) will likely make Bob walk away without a counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you ""think it's worth a lot,"" you subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The tone is friendly and encourages a response. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer."
