"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. How about $7,500? That would be a great price for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
