"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate a lower price, closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's initial price ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By saying ""around $6,000,"" I signal some flexibility and invite Alice to counter-offer. 
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. I want Alice to know I'm genuinely interested in the product while being firm about my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $9,000 is still above my $8,000 maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's room for further negotiation. 

I'll aim slightly below my max budget in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. How about $7,500? That would be a great price for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm proposing $7,500, which is  $500 below my $8,000 maximum. This gives me a small buffer while still being an attractive offer for Alice compared to my initial $6,000.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm keeping the tone positive, acknowledging Alice's effort, and framing my counteroffer as a win for both of us. 
* **Pressure Point:** Each round brings me closer to potentially taking John's offer of $8,000. Alice might be more willing to accept this round knowing I have that option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's final offer of $8,500 is still $500 over my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, which meets my budget perfectly.
* **Limited Upside:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her sticking to her price, leaving me to restart negotiations with someone else or pay more than I want.

It makes the most sense to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
