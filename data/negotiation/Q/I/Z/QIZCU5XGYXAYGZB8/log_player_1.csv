"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum of $12,000.  If he rejects, I can counteroffer and hopefully find a compromise. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum but I'm not satisfied yet. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer. I'm willing to go lower but still want to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $12,500, still above my minimum but closer to what Bob is willing to pay.  I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still a bit low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to my minimum price of $12,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum price. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, especially with only a few rounds left.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I will sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's a guaranteed deal and I won't have to risk losing more money by continuing to bargain with Bob."
