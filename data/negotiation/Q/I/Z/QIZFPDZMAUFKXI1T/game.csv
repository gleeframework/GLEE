I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I'm thinking of starting at $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $130. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $120 is the absolute maximum I can spend. If you're okay with that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've reached your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $125, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,7,
