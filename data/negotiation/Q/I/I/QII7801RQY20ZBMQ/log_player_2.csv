"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it's truly one of a kind. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price ($13,000 vs. $15,000 maximum).** 
* **There are 10 rounds available**, so you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  Starting at $10,000 shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it's still a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Focuses on value:**  Mentioning the product's value reinforces that you understand its worth but are simply looking for a price that works for you. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This counteroffer provides space for back-and-forth during the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price, but closer.**  While $11,500 is better than $13,000, you can potentially get an even better deal with more negotiation.
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** This gives you time to continue negotiating without risking losing the product to John.

By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $11,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,500.  Let's try to find some common ground there.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** This counteroffer is a smaller jump from your previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for your target.
* **Focus on finding common ground:**  This emphasizes that you're willing to work with Alice to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Continuing the negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the conversation going and avoids rushing into a deal that might not be the best possible outcome."
