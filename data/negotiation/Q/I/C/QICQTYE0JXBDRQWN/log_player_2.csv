# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $130, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice's offer of $130 is less than your maximum price of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money."
