Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still believe $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer.  While Bob is moving closer to the $2M mark, we're aiming higher. Let's see if we can nudge him further in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,900,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal happen.
