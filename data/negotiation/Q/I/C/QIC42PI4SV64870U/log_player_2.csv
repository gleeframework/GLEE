"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. To start, I'll offer you the product for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A $9,000 offer is a reasonable starting point for your counter-offer. It's a significant drop from Alice's $10,000 offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Messaging:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value you place on the product, making your offer seem more legitimate. 
* **Next Steps:**  You'll see how Alice responds to your counter-offer and can adjust your strategy based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to offer it for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $9,500 is a fair compromise. Accepting the offer saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John, and you're still well within your budget.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially as you're nearing the halfway point of the rounds."
