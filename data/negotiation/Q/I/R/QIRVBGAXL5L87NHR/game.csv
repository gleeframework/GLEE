"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start the conversation at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still allows for a healthy profit for me while also recognizing the value you'll gain from this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
