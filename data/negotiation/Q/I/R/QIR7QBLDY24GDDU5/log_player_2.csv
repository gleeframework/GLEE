You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $7,400 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $8,000.
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $600 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price, and the risk of losing the deal increases."
