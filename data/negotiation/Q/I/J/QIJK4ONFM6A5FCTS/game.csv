"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's try to find a middle ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13500.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there at $13500. How about we split the difference and settle at $14250? It's a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $14250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle again at $13875? This is my final offer, I'm not sure I can go any higher.",13875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This would be a win for both of us and finally close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,7,
