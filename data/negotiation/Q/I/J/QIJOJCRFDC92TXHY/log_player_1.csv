I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This leaves a substantial profit for me while still being a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000. This strategy aims to secure a good price quickly while leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to earn a good amount while also making it attractive for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While this is less than my ideal price, Bob seems unwilling to meet my price point. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse outcome. John's offer is a guaranteed sale, and I can walk away with a decent profit."
