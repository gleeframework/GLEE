"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price close to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and only getting $100 from John.  Accepting his offer secures a profit of $10, which is better than selling to John."
