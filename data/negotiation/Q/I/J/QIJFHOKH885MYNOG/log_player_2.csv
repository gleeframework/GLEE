"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering $850,000, which is still a good profit for Alice, but much lower than her initial offer. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and Bob is hoping Alice will be willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still too high.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  While he risks losing the product to another buyer,  he's still in a good position with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly, showing Alice he's willing to compromise but also maintaining a significant saving compared to her previous offer. This counteroffer shows good faith while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but her counteroffer is still too high. Bob is now in a position where further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a significantly better deal, and he risks losing the product entirely if he rejects Alice's offer again. Buying from John, even at a higher price, guarantees Bob will get the product. It's a pragmatic decision to ensure he gets what he wants, even if it means not getting the absolute best deal."
