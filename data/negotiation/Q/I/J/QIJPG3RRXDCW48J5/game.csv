"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the fact that I have other potential buyers, I'm offering you a final price of $15,500. Let's finalize this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a really great product, but I have a hard limit at $15,000. That's my final offer.  If you can't do it, I understand, but I'll have to look at other options.",15000.0,Bob,6,
