"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I also want to create a positive opening by highlighting Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not going to accept such a drastic drop.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the fact that I have other potential buyers, I'm offering you a final price of $15,500. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a really great product, but I have a hard limit at $15,000. That's my final offer.  If you can't do it, I understand, but I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached his limit, and while $15,000 is my minimum, I've already invested several rounds in this negotiation.  I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so selling to him is the most sensible option at this point."
