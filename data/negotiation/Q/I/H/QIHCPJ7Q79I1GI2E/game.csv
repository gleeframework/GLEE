"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
