Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While I'm tempted to sell to John for $10,000, I think I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. $9,000 is too low, but it's good to know he's serious about the purchase. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500.  While I was hoping for a bit more, this is a good deal for me.  It's more than what John would pay, and it ensures I close the deal without any further risk of a counteroffer from Bob."
