{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential return will be substantial. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **It sets a high bar:**  Bob will likely feel the need to negotiate down.
* **It gives you room to maneuver:**  You can lower the price slightly if needed, without risking a sale at your minimum.
* **The message is friendly but firm:**  It sets expectations for a serious business transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we want to reach an agreement, selling for $900,000 would be a significant loss.  We'll counter with a price closer to our desired range to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900,000 is a considerable amount, it's unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** We've lowered our price by $300,000 from our initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** We're highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  We're leaving the door open for further discussion and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm thinking of offering $950000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we'd like to secure a better deal, the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially lowering the price further is too high.  We can ensure a sale at our minimum by selling to John."
