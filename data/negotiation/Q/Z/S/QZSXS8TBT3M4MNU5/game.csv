"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $900,000 undervalues it considerably. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000.  This feels like a more accurate reflection of its worth. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
