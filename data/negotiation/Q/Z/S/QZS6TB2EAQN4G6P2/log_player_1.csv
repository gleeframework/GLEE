"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $18,000, knowing it's more than the product is worth to Bob but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm giving Bob a reason to counter-offer, which allows me to gauge his interest and potentially work towards a middle ground.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 in mind. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive, I'll choose to sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering.  I'll aim for a middle ground that's closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed way to meet my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $14,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about $12,500? That's a substantial increase from my last offer and  moves us closer to a fair deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but $12,500 is still below my desired price. How about we meet halfway again and go with $13,500?  This offers a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. "", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to stay within my budget. How about $12,800? That's a fair offer considering the value I place on it.
