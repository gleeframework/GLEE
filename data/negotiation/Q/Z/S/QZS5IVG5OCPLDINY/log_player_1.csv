Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you are serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price. You have room to negotiate further and see if you can reach a price closer to your initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired price and is still much higher than selling to John. It's time to secure the deal and avoid further negotiation."
