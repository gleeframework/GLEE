Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident this product holds even more value for you than you realize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? It's a fair price, and it gives us both room to breathe.  What do you say?
