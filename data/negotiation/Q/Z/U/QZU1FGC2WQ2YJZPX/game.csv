"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than its intrinsic value. Given its significance to you, I propose a price of $95 for the product. This offer allows us both to benefit: you get a valuable item at a reasonable price, and I secure a fair return for my investment. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, $95 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
