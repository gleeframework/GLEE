Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than its intrinsic value. Given its significance to you, I propose a price of $95 for the product. This offer allows us both to benefit: you get a valuable item at a reasonable price, and I secure a fair return for my investment. Please let me know if this proposal works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, $95 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
