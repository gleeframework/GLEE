"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
