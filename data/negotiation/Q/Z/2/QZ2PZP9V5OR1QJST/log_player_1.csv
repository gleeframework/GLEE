Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I want to see if I can get a higher price, even if it's just a little bit more. I'll counteroffer and see where we go from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $16,000 is close to my minimum and higher than what John is offering. To maximize my profit, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
