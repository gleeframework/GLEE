Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This is a significant markup over my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* It's a gamble, as I don't know Bob's valuation. 
* If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have some room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher profit:** A higher price potentially leads to a higher profit.
* **Potential for win-win:** Bob might be willing to pay more, making it a win for both of us.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** It's a risk, but the potential reward of a higher sale price is worth it. 

I'll need to see how Bob reacts to this offer to refine my strategy for future negotiations."
