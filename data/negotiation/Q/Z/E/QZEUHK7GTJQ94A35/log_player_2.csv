I'm going to offer Alice $140. This is my best price, but it's still below what I'm willing to pay to John. I'm hoping that she'll accept, but I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't."

While $160 is closer to my budget, I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. I'm willing to pay John $150, and I think I can still get a better deal from Alice. I'll make another counteroffer."

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay John $150, so this is the best I can do. I'm hoping Alice will accept, but if she doesn't, I'll go with John."

Alice is not budging from her price, and I'm not willing to pay more than $150. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
