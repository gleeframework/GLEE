# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its worth to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider this proposal carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
