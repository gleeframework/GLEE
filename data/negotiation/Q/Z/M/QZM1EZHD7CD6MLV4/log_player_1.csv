Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price.  Would you be willing to pay $120 for it?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Starting High:**  Offering a price of $120 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Staying Profitable:** This price ensures you make a significant profit ($40) over your fallback option of selling to John. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
