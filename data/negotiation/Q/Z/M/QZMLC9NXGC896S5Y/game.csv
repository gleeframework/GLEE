"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $18000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's work towards a deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,
