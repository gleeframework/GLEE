"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great starting point. While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  He should counter-offer and see if he can get the price lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $850,000 is still a bit high for Bob. He can try to get the price down even further with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. Let's split the difference and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, he's gotten the price down significantly from the initial offer and is close to his target. It's unlikely he'll be able to get a much better deal with Alice, and going to John would cost him a lot more."
