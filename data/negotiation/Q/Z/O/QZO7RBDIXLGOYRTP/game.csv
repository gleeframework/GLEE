"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. This price is fair and reflects my genuine interest in purchasing this product.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's compromise and meet at $1,450,000.  This price is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
