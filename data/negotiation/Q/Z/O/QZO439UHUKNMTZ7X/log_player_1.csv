"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know it's unlikely Bob will accept this price immediately, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will be close enough for him to accept, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll counter in the next round, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $95. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With Bob's last offer at $82, we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd like to get.  Since I'm already in round 6, there's not a lot of room for further negotiation. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $100. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a better deal than what Bob is currently offering."
