{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, allowing me to potentially get a higher price while still being attractive to Bob.  I'm willing to go lower if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $14,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still can't go above $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price given its value. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go any higher than $12,000, and I'm not comfortable accepting that price. Since John is also willing to pay $12,000, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
