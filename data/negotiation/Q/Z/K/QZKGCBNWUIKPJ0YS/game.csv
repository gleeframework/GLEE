"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm looking to invest a bit less than $1200000. Would you consider a price of $1000000? I believe this is still a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
