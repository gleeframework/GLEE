"Round 1

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more substantial move on your end. To be clear, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,250,000. This takes into account the value it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still higher than my maximum.  I'm determined to stay within my budget, and I still believe we can find a compromise.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price.
