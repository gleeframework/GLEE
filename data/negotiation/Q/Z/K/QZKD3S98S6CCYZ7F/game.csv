"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is considerably below its true value.  This product offers unique advantages that I'm confident can significantly benefit your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects its real worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's potential benefits, but $1,350,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given our respective needs. This offer represents a significant increase from my previous proposal and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more substantial move on your end. To be clear, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,250,000. This takes into account the value it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer is within my price range, and I believe it represents a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
