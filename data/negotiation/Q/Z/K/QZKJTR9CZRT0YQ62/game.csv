,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $8,625?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach an agreement.",8625.0,Alice,5,
