"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85. If you can't meet me there, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm only willing to go up to $90. If you can't accept that, I'll have to move on.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $91. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",91.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm almost there, but $91 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $90.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",90.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. I'm willing to meet you at $90.75. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done.",90.75,Alice,9,
