"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $90 at this point.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a deal that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $98. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
