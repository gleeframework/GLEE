"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,100,000. This reflects my strong belief in its value while still offering you a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
