"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can do $18,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $18,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $14,000. Would that work for you?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your target, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $16,000, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,6,
