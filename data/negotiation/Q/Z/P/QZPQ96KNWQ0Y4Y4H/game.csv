"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17500. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000.
