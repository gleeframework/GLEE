Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 to make it worth my while.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

While $20,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to make the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.
