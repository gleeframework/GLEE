"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 to make it worth my while.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response and understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for us both.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  I believe this reflects the product's true worth and offers significant value for your investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still quite a bit more than I had in mind.  To be honest,  $8,000 is the absolute most I can justify spending on this.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to make the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
