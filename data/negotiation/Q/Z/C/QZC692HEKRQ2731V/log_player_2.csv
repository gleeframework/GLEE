"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiating.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $700,000. It's a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price lower, but $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

At $650,000, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. It's a good price compared to John's offer."
