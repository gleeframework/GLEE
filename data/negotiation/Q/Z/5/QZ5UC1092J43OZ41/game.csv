"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to the right buyer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $850000 is a significant amount for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $950000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",920000.0,Alice,5,
