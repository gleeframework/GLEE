"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's also a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum expectation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to look at other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
