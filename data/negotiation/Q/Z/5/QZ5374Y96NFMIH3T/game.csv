"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value you'll gain from owning it. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, based on my assessment, I am still unable to agree to $1100000. I would like to propose $1050000 as a compromise. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
