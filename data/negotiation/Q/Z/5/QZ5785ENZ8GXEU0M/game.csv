"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the price I was initially willing to accept from John. This is the best I can do, so let me know if this is a price you're willing to pay.",10000.0,Alice,5,
