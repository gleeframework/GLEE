"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product, though. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you and your business.",15500.0,Alice,5,
