Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you and I'm happy to offer it to you for $950,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth far more than that in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" from John's offer.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to persuade him while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
