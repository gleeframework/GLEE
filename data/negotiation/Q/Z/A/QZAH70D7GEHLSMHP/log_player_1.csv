Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to make. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about $950,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to what I need, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  I'm confident that this product will be valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
