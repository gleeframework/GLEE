"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal,  $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a good deal on a quality product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price to $10,000, this is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating a lower price.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, he has a solid fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still holding out for $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, but Alice's offer of $9,500 is only $500 less than his maximum budget.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. By buying from John for $8,000, Bob saves a significant amount of money and avoids the possibility of the deal falling through entirely."
