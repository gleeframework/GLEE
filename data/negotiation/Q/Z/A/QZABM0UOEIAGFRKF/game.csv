"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $15500. This is the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
