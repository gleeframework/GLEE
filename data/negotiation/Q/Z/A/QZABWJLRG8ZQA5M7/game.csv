"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $1,500,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's more than fair.  My offer is $1,250,000.  It's a significant saving for you and a good deal for me. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
