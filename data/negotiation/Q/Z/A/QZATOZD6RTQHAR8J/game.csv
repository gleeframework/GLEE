"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth a great deal to you, and this price reflects that while still giving you a substantial return on your investment.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still gives you a substantial profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to achieve a significant return on your investment. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but $1,275,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,287,500?  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our target price. Let's close this deal.",1287500.0,Alice,7,
