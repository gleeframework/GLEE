"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down a little further. How about $1,350,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
