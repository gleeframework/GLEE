# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To be fair to us both, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This feels like a good middle ground where we both see value.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,450,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and with limited rounds remaining, it's not likely he can negotiate a lower price.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making it the safer and more financially beneficial option."
