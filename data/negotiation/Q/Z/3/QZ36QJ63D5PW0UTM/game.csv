Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm afraid $1050000 is still below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1275000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
