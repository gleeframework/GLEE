Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $12,000 is a good starting point that's likely to pique Bob's interest, encouraging him to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to find a mutually beneficial solution.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for $12,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-offer.
* **Negotiation Stalls:** If I feel the negotiation isn't progressing, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, it's still below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first to see if I can get a better deal. 

**Next Step:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  This is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a firm bottom line.
* **Final Offer:** Stating that it's my final offer adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider accepting. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price of $10,500.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll likely move on to John and sell the product for $15,000 since Bob has already shown a reluctance to meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not quite there:** While Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to my minimum of $15,000, it's still below it.
* **No further negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $15,000.  This is a more secure and profitable option compared to potentially getting another rejection from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $15,000."
