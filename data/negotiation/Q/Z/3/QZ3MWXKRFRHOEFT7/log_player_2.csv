"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $130
* **Your Value:** $150
* **Alice's Value:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than your value ($130 < $150), it's beneficial to accept her offer. This saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
