Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can see where he's coming from and try to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows Bob I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to my minimum value of $12,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to sell to John for the same price, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. I've already lowered my offer to my absolute floor. There's no point in continuing this negotiation. I'll take John's offer for $12,000."
