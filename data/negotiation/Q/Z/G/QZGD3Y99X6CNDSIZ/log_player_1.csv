Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you add a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in the price and that Bob doesn't know your absolute bottom line."
