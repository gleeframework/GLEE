Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  The price of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,200,000), giving Bob a chance to negotiate without me losing too much.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage and potentially accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and offering a reasonable price, I aim to secure a good deal while keeping the door open for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my counteroffer based on his response.  If negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  This will give me a chance to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price.  I'll still keep the option of selling to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still reflects the product's value. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-offer that's closer to his proposed price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my counter-offer by highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the reduction from my initial offer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $1,050,000 is a fair price for both of us. This aims to create a sense of collaboration and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to gradually decrease my price in increments, making it seem like I'm compromising while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  If Bob rejects, I'll continue to adjust my offer based on his responses, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it would be ideal to get closer to that value, the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is not worth it. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale. The potential loss of $175,000 is less than the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John. This ensures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
