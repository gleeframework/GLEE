Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a balance between its worth and your potential gain."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that still leaves you with a significant profit margin. It's unlikely Bob would find a better deal elsewhere considering his perceived value is $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a single offer scenario, a slightly higher initial price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager, potentially leading to an even better deal for you."
