,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
