Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,500,000 from John, so I have some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer. This shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell. I believe this price is still fair given the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price while also minimizing the risk of a stalemate."
