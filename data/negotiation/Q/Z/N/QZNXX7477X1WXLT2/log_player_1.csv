Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential the product offers."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,900,000. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above his perceived value. Accepting now would be leaving a lot of potential profit on the table. We're willing to negotiate further, but we need to signal that we're getting closer to our walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,825,000.  This offer takes into account the points you've raised while still reflecting the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're coming down in smaller increments now, signaling that our price is firming up. This offer splits the difference between the previous two offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but still pushing for a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,825,000. I'm willing to pay $1,725,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently incrementing his offers by $100,000, while we are reducing ours at a faster rate. This indicates that we might be conceding too quickly.  We are still significantly above his perceived value of $1,200,000 and need to apply more pressure.  We will hold firm on our previous offer to gauge his seriousness."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, but my previous offer of $1,825,000 represents a firm commitment on my end. This product has considerable potential, and I'm confident in its value. I'm open to hearing your thoughts, but I believe this price is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're holding firm at our previous offer to signal that we're reaching our limit. This puts the ball back in Bob's court and forces him to either meet our price, reveal more of his negotiation strategy, or walk away. By reiterating the product's value, we're reminding him of what's at stake."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,825,000. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we still have room above our guaranteed sale price with John, Bob is now showing a willingness to compromise more significantly. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $250,000 over our safety net and avoids the risk of pushing Bob too far and losing the deal entirely."
