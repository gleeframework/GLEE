"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's in great condition and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $160 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $150, but I'm not sure I can go up to $160. How about $155? Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",155.0,Bob,4,
