"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's a great value for you too. Considering its worth to both of us, how about we start at $95? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that suits both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still quite a bit over his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Let's try $85 as a starting point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value we both see in the product, how does $90 sound as a starting point? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit higher than he wants to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to push for a lower price.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has already countered once, so there's a good chance she'll be more flexible in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $87.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. To move forward, how about we consider $89 as a starting point for the product price? I believe this offers a fair compromise between our expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is just $9 over Bob's ideal price of $80. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's already shown his willingness to pay up to $87. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids risking further negotiation rounds that could lead to him buying from John for a higher price."
