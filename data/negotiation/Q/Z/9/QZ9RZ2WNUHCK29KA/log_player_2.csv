"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds an intrinsic value of $15,000 to you. However, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $13,500. This offer is designed to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, providing you with significant savings while allowing me to maximize the value received for my product. Please let me know if you require any further information or if you wish to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting price is too high. While she presented a good sales pitch, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might come down in price if you reject her initial offer."
