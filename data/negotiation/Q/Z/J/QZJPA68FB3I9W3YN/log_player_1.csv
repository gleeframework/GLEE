Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob to make the offer more tempting. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Gain:**  A higher starting price gives me more room to compromise while still getting a good deal.
* **Keep Bob Engaged:**  By being open to negotiation, I'm encouraging Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach an agreement.
* **Maintain the Option to Sell to John:** I can always choose to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John for my desired price if I don't reach a satisfactory deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John as a Safety Net:** Selling to John is still an option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the chance to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** I'm lowering my price from my initial offer but still staying well above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a compromise and a ""middle ground"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying Above the Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, which gives me some leeway.

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase the Chance of Agreement:** A counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price might encourage him to accept.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** It demonstrates that I'm flexible and open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintain a Good Position:** I'm not giving away too much and still have the option to sell to John if Bob refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can find a better solution. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $1,000,000 is only $500,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  This is a significant difference, but it's worth considering the potential risks of further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with no other options besides selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially result in a lower offer from Bob or even a complete breakdown in negotiations.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale for a price that is relatively close to my minimum and avoids the risk of losing a buyer entirely. While it's not ideal, it's a practical decision given the circumstances."
