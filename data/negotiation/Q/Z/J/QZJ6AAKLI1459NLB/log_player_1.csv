"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $95 from Bob is a better outcome than selling to John for $100. It's always good to leave a little room for negotiation, and this price is still a decent profit over my minimum."
