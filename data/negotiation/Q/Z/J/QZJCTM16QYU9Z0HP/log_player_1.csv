Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This is a strong starting point that allows for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable and worth a premium.  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum value, it's significantly lower than my initial ask and leaves little room for profit.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to make a profit, at this point, the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection isn't worth the potential reward.  John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is much safer and aligns with my minimum acceptable value."
