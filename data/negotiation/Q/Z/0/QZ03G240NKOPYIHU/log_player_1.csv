Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him incentive to negotiate.  By starting high, you're setting a strong initial position and maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  You have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, but only if he's willing to offer a price closer to your value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, reducing the price slightly from your initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  It shows you're willing to negotiate but also indicates you're not willing to go much lower.  It's a strategic move to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what you could get from John.  You're already at a point where further negotiation with Bob may not be fruitful, considering his reluctance to move up from $10,000. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John, as the risk of further negotiation with Bob is higher than the potential reward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

This is a risky move. It's a smaller concession than before, and it's still significantly lower than what John is offering.  

The reasoning here is that Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum price and you're hoping that a small compromise from your side might convince him to accept. This is a gamble because Bob might simply reject this offer again.  However, if he does accept, it's still a better deal than selling to John.  The decision will be based on how optimistic you are about Bob's willingness to negotiate further."
