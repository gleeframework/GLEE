"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a competitive price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's enthusiasm is appreciated, her offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting her offer over buying from John at the same price. By rejecting, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price, allowing you to save some money."
