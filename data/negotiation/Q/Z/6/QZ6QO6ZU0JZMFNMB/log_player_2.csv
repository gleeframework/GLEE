"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a rare gem in the market, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting the offer at $1,050,000 saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John, and represents a good compromise.  Further negotiation might save a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too great."
