"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1200000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal, there's likely room for negotiation to get an even better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the discount, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $850,000 is a good deal, there's still potential to get a lower price.  He can try to negotiate further, especially since Alice already lowered her price once."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  How about $800,000? This would still be a great profit for you, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. While he could try to counteroffer again, there's a good chance Alice will stand firm at $825,000. At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's price and still within Bob's budget.  It's a good compromise and a better outcome than risking further negotiation."
