"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1200000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the discount, $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's closer to what I can afford.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  How about $800000? This would still be a great profit for you, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
