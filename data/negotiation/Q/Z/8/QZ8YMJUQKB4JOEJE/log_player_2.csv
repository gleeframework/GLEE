Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and I think you'll really appreciate it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. $175 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $150, but I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the condition, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
