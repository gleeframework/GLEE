"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the high price by highlighting the product's ""unique features and potential.""  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and I'm explicitly asking for Bob's thoughts, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Anchor:** Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gain Information:**  Understand how much Bob is willing to pay. 
3. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts my initial offer, I secure a significant profit. 
 
I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1,000,000 to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and my initial offer. While his message indicates interest, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 

It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. I believe there's room to negotiate a better deal with Bob. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I can:

* **Demonstrate Flexibility:** Show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.
* **Guide the Negotiation:**  Steer the price closer to a range that's acceptable to me.
* **Maintain the Option of John:** Keep the possibility of selling to John open if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While your initial offer is below what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle - how about we consider $1,700,000? This reflects the true value of the product's capabilities."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've made a significant price reduction from my initial offer ($2,000,000 to $1,700,000) to signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still well above his initial offer and my minimum.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm appealing to a sense of fairness and encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a higher offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price, subtly shifting the focus away from just the numbers.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Movement:** Prompt Bob to increase his offer significantly.
2. **Maintain Control:** Stay within a price range where I'm comfortable.
3. **Continue Negotiation:** Keep the dialogue open and explore potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a big stretch for me. I could potentially do $1,250,000 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now inching closer to my minimum price, but $1,250,000 is still unacceptably low. His language (""big stretch,"" ""potentially do"") suggests he might be willing to go higher. 

While selling to John is an increasingly attractive option, I believe I can nudge Bob closer to $1,500,000 with a carefully crafted counteroffer. It's worth risking another round to explore this possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** I'm introducing a sense of urgency and transparency by revealing that I have a ""hard minimum."" This signals to Bob that I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Significant Concession, Justified:**  I've dropped my price considerably, closer to Bob's last offer while still staying above my absolute minimum. Highlighting this as a ""significant compromise"" emphasizes its value.
* **Focus on Fairness:** By framing the price as a ""fair deal for both of us,"" I appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage a collaborative approach. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Elicit a Final Offer:**  Encourage Bob to make his best offer, hopefully closer to my target. 
2. **Prepare for Potential Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't meet my needs, I'm mentally prepared to walk away and sell to John.
3. **Maintain a Positive Tone:** Even though this is a critical juncture, I'm keeping the tone respectful and solution-oriented."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my absolute maximum is $1,300,000. If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his ""absolute maximum"" of $1,300,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. His language (""unfortunately have to explore other options"") implies he is unlikely to budge. 

Continuing negotiations at this point would likely result in:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Small concessions from either side are unlikely to bridge the gap. 
* **Wasted Time and Effort:** We've already spent six rounds without reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for Relationship Strain:** Pushing further could damage the negotiating relationship. 

John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price.  It makes more sense to take the sure thing and maximize my profit."
