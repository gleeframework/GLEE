"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle on $700,000? That's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I think you're still undervaluing the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is close to what I can do, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?  This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to split the difference that far. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell it to you for $825,000. However, I need to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, so I'll actually sell it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.",825000.0,Alice,7,
