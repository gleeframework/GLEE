"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950,000. This price is closer to my budget and still reflects the value I see in the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Would you consider $900,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to get a great value for my money.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $900,000, which is $975,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
