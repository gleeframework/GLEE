Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's worth $800,000 to Bob, Alice is asking for $1,200,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, but I want to see if I can squeeze a slightly better deal out of Alice. I'll reject her offer and try another counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Would you consider $900,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $900,000, which is $975,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still significantly higher than my target of $800,000.  While we've made some progress, I'm not comfortable paying that much.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $800,000. This is the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
