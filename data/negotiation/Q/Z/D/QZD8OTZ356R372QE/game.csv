"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I agree the product has value, my budget is pushing me towards something closer to $925,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
