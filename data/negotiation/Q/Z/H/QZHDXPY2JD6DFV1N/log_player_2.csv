# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

You can do better than $11,000.  Reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You can save $2,000 by accepting Alice's offer, which is better than buying from John for $12,000.  There's a chance you could get a lower price if you keep negotiating, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
