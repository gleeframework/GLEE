"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm looking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I want to establish a positive rapport with Bob to encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:**  $9,000 is a good starting point because it leaves room for both of us to move towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John, so I'm not going to accept his offer. 
* **Negotiating is key:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a great price for a product that's worth so much to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using persuasive language to try and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's worth a lot to you, and I am interested in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time to push for more:** I've already made a concession, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is a great deal for both of us.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $8,000, which is still within my desired range and represents a fair compromise.
* **Highlighting the benefit:** I'm focusing on the benefit to Bob, emphasizing that the product is a worthwhile investment.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm trying to close the deal by expressing confidence and suggesting a sense of urgency."
