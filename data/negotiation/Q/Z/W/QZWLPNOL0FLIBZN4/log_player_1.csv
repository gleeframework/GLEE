"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with my desired price, knowing it's likely too high for Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows I'm willing to discuss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm proposing a compromise by lowering my price to $14,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I still believe $12,000 is a fair price for the product. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between these two prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going lower than $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm now proposing $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm actively trying to reach a deal, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum, but we're getting closer. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
