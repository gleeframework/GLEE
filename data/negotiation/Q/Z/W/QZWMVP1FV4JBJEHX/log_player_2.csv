The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $900,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and still within my budget.  It leaves room for negotiation while showing I'm serious about buying the product."

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $50,000 over my target. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
