"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get the best possible price, but $11,500 is still quite a bit higher than my ideal range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a good price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to offer $10,750. This is a fair price that's within both our ranges, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,7,
