"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to me ($8,000). I have 10 rounds and can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$11,500 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I have more rounds to negotiate and I can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get the best possible price, but $11,500 is still quite a bit higher than my ideal range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a good price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming to get a better deal. I have 5 rounds left and I'm confident I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to offer $10,750. This is a fair price that's within both our ranges, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, I'm getting closer to my ideal price range. While I'd prefer to pay even less, $11,250 is a fair compromise and I'm not sure I can get much lower in the remaining rounds. I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Alice may get frustrated and walk away.  It's better to secure the deal at this price than to risk losing the opportunity altogether."
