Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but also maximizes your profit.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value increases the chances of him accepting.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at the special price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value proposition, justifying the price. 
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit, significantly more than your minimum. It also gives Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value, making the offer attractive. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,000,000) is crucial.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price for a more collaborative tone.
