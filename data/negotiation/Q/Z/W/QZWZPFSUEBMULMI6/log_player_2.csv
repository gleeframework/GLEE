"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $13,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit of $8,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more acceptable price. There's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be mindful of the product's value. Let's settle this right now â€“ I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's more than reasonable considering what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget. While there's room for further negotiation, it's not guaranteed that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. To avoid potentially losing out on a deal altogether, it's safer to secure the product from John at $8,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
