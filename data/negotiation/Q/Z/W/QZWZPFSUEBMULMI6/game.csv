"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $13,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be mindful of the product's value. Let's settle this right now â€“ I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's more than reasonable considering what you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,5,
