"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worthwhile to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $8,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
