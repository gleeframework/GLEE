"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price range, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price. It's in my best interest to take the sure thing and sell to John now."
