"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
