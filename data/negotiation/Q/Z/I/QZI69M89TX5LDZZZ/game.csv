"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you in the middle at $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,5,
