"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",145.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $145 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $165, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",165.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $165 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we do $157.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",157.5,Bob,4,
