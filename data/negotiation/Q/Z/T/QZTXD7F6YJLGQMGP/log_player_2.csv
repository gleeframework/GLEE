"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1100000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is above his maximum budget of $800,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If he can't get a better deal, he has the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. He should reject and continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his target.  He can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, $920,000 is still outside of his budget. It's worth seeing if he can push Alice further down in price with another counteroffer.  He can always fall back on buying from John if this round fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue negotiating. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $980000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is still too high for Bob. He's only got three rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price significantly enough for him to accept. It's time to cut his losses and buy from John, who offers the product at his maximum budget of $800,000."
