"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's desired price ($8,000) but still offers him a significant discount from the original offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation,  allowing room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $10,500. This is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,000 and  still represents a $1,500 savings compared to buying from John.  

While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection from Alice and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a worse outcome."
