Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000 before I open up the opportunity to other buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 is still substantially higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, the message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and positions the price as a potential bargain before it goes to other buyers.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A faster sale means I have the money to reinvest or utilize sooner, which has inherent value. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed offer from John as a safety net."
