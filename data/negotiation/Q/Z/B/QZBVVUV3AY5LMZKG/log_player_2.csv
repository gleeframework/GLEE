"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to tell if $500,000 is a good deal.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to explore if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
``` 

Bob starts by offering half of Alice's price. This is a bold move but might be enough to get Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should continue to negotiate.  $400,000 is still significantly less than what he'd pay John, so there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
``` 

Bob is showing his willingness to negotiate, offering a price closer to Alice's last offer but still well below it. He's trying to find a middle ground and see if Alice will budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is getting closer to his maximum price. Accepting Alice's offer of $350,000 saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John. There's a good chance Alice won't go lower, so it's a reasonable compromise."
