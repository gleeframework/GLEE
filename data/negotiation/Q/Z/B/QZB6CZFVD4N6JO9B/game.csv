"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While I understand your position,  I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,120,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,085,000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also being within my budget.",1085000.0,Bob,4,
