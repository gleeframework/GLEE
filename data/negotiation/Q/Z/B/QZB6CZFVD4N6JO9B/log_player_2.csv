"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good starting point, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting yours.  While I understand your position,  I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, $1,120,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. Bob has room to negotiate further and should aim for a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation process active and allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,120,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,085,000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
