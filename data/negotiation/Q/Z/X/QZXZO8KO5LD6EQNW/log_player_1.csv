Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, you still make a decent profit. If he rejects, you can use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It still leaves room for negotiation, but it's closer to my desired price point and shows I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price point, Bob's counteroffers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of further negotiation and potential further price reductions isn't worth it. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
