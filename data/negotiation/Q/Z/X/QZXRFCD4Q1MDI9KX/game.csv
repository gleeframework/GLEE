"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for you to consider selling the product for $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This still exceeds my preferred budget, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $105. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
