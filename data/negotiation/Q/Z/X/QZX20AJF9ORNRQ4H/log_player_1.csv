{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a great opportunity to own something special, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $14,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $14000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob has been firm on $14,000. It's better to accept his offer now than risk losing him entirely and only getting $10,000 from John."
