Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows me to maximize my potential profit while still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **For me:** $14,000 is a significant improvement over the $12,000 I'd get from John.
* **For Bob:** $14,000 is still a good deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to him. He's getting a good value and saving $1,000.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of getting a better price."
