"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $700,000? I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget. However, $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, so to move things forward, I propose a price of $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering the immense potential this product holds for your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still looking to keep my expenses within a specific limit. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
