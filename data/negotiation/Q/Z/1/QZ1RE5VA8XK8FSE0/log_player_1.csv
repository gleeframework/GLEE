"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This sets a strong starting point. 
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the value to Bob reinforces his interest and incentivizes him to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The offer is not my ""bottom line"",  allowing for flexibility and potential for a win-win outcome. 
* **Keeping the option to sell to John open:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still choose to sell to John and secure my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While he's willing to pay a premium, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  The fact that Bob is willing to negotiate shows potential for a deal that's more favorable to me.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially drive the price up in the next round. 
* **Sell to John as a backup:**  The option to sell to John is still available if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value the product brings to you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within a reasonable range:**  $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer, showing flexibility while maintaining my bargaining position.
* **Focus on value and mutual benefit:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, and framing the offer as a win-win scenario to incentivize him to accept. 
* **Opening room for negotiation:** By mentioning ""middle ground,"" I'm implying further potential for compromise in the future rounds.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum target of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob's willingness to negotiate further indicates potential for a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the pressure on and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Sell to John as a backup:** I'm still prepared to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to compromise a little further. How about $875,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. I'm confident this product will be a great asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** My counteroffer is a smaller reduction from my previous offer, showing I'm still holding firm on price but willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I frame the offer as a ""fair price"" for both parties to emphasize the win-win aspect. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's potential benefits to his business keeps him focused on the long-term value.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** I'm still prepared to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $825000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is increasing to reach an agreement.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $825,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and potentially ending up with a deal that's far below my target.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of a bad deal with Bob.

Given the limited time and the potential for further price concessions, it's the safest and most profitable decision to sell the product to John."
