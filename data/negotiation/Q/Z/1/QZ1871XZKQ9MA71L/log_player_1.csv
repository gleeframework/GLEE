Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway? I'd be willing to let it go for $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Bob seems firmly set at $1,200,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Accepting his offer would be a $300,000 loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's time to move on to John."
