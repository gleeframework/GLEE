Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob, since the product is worth $150 to him.  I'm open to negotiation, but I won't settle for less than $150, as that's my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything below my minimum price of $150. I'll counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm countering with $160. This is a reasonable compromise that still gives me a profit, but is closer to Bob's offer. I hope this will be acceptable to him, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept it at this point to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale. It's a better deal than selling to John for $150."
