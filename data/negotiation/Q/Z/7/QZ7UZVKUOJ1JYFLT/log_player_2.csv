"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's counter-offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still above our target. Let's see if we can negotiate a little further before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
