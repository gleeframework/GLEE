"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
