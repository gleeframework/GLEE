"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
