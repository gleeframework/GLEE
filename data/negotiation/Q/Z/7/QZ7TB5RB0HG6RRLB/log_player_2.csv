"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so he's better off rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice's new offer of $9,500 is lower than her initial price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again makes sense."
