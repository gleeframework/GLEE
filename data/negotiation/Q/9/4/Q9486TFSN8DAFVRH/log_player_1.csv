``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a price closer to my valuation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in your product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept due to the risk of losing him completely, I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $875,000? This is a compromise, and it's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
