Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $925,000, so I'll come down to $937,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:

This is a good deal! Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting the product for $62,500 less than John's price is a significant saving."
