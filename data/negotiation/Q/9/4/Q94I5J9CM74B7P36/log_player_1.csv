"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""unique"" qualities and emphasizing its ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception at a higher price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and collaborative, indicating my willingness to engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This represents a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. While he acknowledged the product's worth, his initial offer suggests he's trying to secure a bargain. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price by countering and demonstrating my willingness to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the uniqueness and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but standing firm that it's too low.  By meeting in the middle, I signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The tone remains collaborative. By phrasing it as ""a fair compromise,"" I'm aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This seems like a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to your last offer and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved significantly closer to a price I find acceptable. While $1,250,000 is only a slight increase from my guaranteed $1,200,000 with John, it's a significant profit margin, and further negotiation might not yield much more movement from Bob. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
