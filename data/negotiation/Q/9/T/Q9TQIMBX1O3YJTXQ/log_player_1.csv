Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**The Offer**

You want to start high to maximize your potential gain, but not so high that Bob walks away immediately.  Here's a possible strategy:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Starting Point:** $950,000 is a strong opening, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" aims to frame the price in terms of Bob's potential gain, not just your asking price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a subtle pressure tactic, implying scarcity and desirability.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower (but still above your minimum).
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  A higher starting price carries a slightly higher risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
