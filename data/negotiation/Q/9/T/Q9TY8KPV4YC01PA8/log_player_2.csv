"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a bold move, but it might push her to come down to a price closer to my limit."

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer.  I'll reject and counter again, aiming for a price closer to my limit."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying below my limit. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer is still above my limit, but it's getting very close. I'll reject and counter one last time before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This is my final offer. It's my limit, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'll buy from John."
