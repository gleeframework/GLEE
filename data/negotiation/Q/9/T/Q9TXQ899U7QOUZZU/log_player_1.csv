"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and $10,000 to me. I'll see how he reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's only worth $10,000 to me and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous offer, it's still not high enough.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one.  $10,750 is a reasonable compromise between my desire for $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500.  I'm hopeful he'll see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I was hopeful of getting a higher price from Bob, he's not willing to budge much. I don't want to risk losing this opportunity for a small gain. John is offering a solid price, and I don't want to waste any more time trying to negotiate with Bob."
