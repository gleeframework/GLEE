"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $950,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. Given the value this product brings, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $850,000. This price is still fair and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $775,000 is still too low.  How about we settle on $825,000? This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $825,000 is pushing it.  How about we agree on $800,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident in the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,6,
