"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

This is my opening offer to Bob. I'm aiming high, at $1,500,000, knowing it's likely he'll counter. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm confident that I can make a good deal with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher offer, but if Bob continues to lowball me, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my minimum. I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to my limit. If Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we are running out of time. While I'd love to get more than $1,200,000, it's clear Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations.  I'm going to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
