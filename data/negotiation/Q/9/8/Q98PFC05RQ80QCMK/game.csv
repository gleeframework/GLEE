"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, to $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
