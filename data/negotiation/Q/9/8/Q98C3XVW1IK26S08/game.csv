"I appreciate your transparency about your budget, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm counteroffering at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to give up as much as that. I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1000000.
