"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $875000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $825000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $835000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product.  Let's try to close this deal!",835000.0,Bob,6,
