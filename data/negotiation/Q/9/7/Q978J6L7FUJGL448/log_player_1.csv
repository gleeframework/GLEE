Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming high but leaving room for compromise. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $8,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming to secure a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 to Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and allows for further negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering Bob's initial counteroffer and my willingness to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and avoid the uncertainty of further counteroffers."
