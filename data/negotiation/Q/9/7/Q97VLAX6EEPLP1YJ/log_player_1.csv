"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will far outweigh the cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the long-term benefits.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm prompting Bob to respond, keeping the conversation going. 

**Next steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering my price slightly in the next round, but I'll still aim for a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob acknowledged the value of the product, so I can likely secure a higher price.
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John right now would be the safe option, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob to see if I can achieve a price closer to my desired range.

**Next steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still acknowledging his budget constraints.  I'll likely offer a price between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price is still within the realm of your budget, and it's a fair compromise given the product's potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-argument:** I address Bob's offer directly, acknowledging his budget concerns but also reiterating the product's value.
* **Compromise:** I offer a price that's significantly higher than his offer but still a substantial discount from my initial asking price. 
* **Emphasize value:** I emphasize the value to Bob, encouraging him to see the investment as worth it.
* **Open-ended question:** I ask for his opinion, keeping the conversation open for further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John if the price remains too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still working within a specific budget. Could we perhaps agree on $1,300,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation progress:** Bob is showing willingness to compromise, indicating potential for reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is of the essence:**  With limited rounds remaining, I need to push for a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget.  However, this product's potential is truly exceptional.  Let's find a middle ground.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6

* **Time is running out:** With only four rounds left, the risk of going lower is increasing. I need to maintain a strong stance to achieve a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a viable alternative:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a very attractive option, providing a guaranteed profit and eliminating the risk of further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $1,350,000 and $1,400,000. I'll emphasize the urgency of the situation and highlight the fact that I'm considering selling to John if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."
