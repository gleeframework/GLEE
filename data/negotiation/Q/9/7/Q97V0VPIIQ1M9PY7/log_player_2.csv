"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, there's no immediate reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be happy to take it for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals his willingness to negotiate and establishes a starting point for bargaining.
* **Reasonable offer:** $125 is still within Bob's maximum budget, making the offer realistic.
* **Open-ended question:**  The message ends with a question, encouraging Alice to engage in further discussion and potentially counter with a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Alice has come down to $140, which is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $125. This indicates a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Within budget:** $140 is still within Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, accepting at this point saves time and effort.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob risks losing the deal altogether.

**Overall:** Accepting Alice's offer in round 3 represents a good balance of saving money and ensuring a purchase."
