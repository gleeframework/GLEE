"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. I could be willing to part with it for $1,700,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still outside my budget.  I could potentially go up to $1,100,000.  Do you think that would be workable?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to where we need to be, it's still a significant gap from my perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we are trying to find a compromise here. $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $1,150,000? That's the highest I can go.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
