{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and future prospects."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. It's clear there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects its immense potential and is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to his perceived value, he's still significantly under my minimum.  I'll counter, but I need to start pushing him closer to a number that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This price acknowledges the value it brings while recognizing your budget concerns.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe it's a fair deal considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob has made it clear this is his final offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation. I can get my desired price from John."
