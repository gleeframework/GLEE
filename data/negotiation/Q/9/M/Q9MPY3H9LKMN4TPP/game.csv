"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and future prospects.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects its immense potential and is a fair price considering its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging my financial limitations.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This price acknowledges the value it brings while recognizing your budget concerns.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe it's a fair deal considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
