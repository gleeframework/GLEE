Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
