"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you know. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. What do you say?
