"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $95. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a little high for me. How about $100?  That would be fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",102.0,Alice,5,
