Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,500,000.  It's a valuable opportunity and I'm confident you'll see the benefits.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not convinced that's the best deal I can get.  I still have 9 rounds left and can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This gives you a significant saving while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is a good price considering my minimum and the fact that we only have 6 rounds left.  I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer from Bob and I don't want to risk selling to John for less."
