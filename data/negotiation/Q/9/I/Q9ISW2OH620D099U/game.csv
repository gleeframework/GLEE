"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a significant amount to me, so my starting price is $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. My counteroffer is $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my new counteroffer is $1,050,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to make one last concession. My final offer is $1,150,000. This price is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without compromising on my minimum. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between $1,050,000 and $1,150,000, so my new counteroffer is $1,100,000. I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
