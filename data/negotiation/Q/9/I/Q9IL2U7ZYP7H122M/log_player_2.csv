"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than the $1,000,000 price from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:**  Alice has moved from $900,000 to $875,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $850,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might become less flexible or even walk away from the deal.
* **Value Comparison:**  The $875,000 price is still a significant saving compared to the $1,000,000 from John.

Given the potential risks and the substantial savings compared to John's offer, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
