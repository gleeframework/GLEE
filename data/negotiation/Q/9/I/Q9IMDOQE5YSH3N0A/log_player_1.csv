Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price closer to our minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving us a better understanding of his willingness to pay.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning that we have another buyer lined up, we create a sense of urgency that might incentivize Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We need to be mindful that Bob only values the product at $800,000. Our offer needs to be compelling enough for him to consider paying significantly more.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we don't have to settle for less than our minimum. This allows us to be more assertive in our negotiations with Bob."
