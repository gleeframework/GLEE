"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This will hopefully get the ball rolling and see if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $72.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $72.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing money on the deal. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $72.50 just doesn't work for me.  I'm at my limit with $90.  This is a great product and you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
