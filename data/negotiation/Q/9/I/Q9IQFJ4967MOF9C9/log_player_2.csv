"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $72.50 just doesn't work for me.  I'm at my limit with $90.  This is a great product and you'll be happy with it.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly staying above our $80 limit.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we risk losing the guaranteed deal with John if we continue to haggle."
