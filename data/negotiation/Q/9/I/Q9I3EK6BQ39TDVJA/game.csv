,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. If that works for you, let's close the deal.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. If you're willing to accept that, we can make this happen.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135. How about we try $127.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $127.50 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference and go with $123.75.  I think that's a fair price that we can both agree on.",123.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $123.75. Let's try $125. I think that's a fair price, and it's still a great deal for you!",125.0,Alice,7,
