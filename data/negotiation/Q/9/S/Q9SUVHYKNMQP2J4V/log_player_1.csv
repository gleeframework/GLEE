Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $925,000 still yields a considerable profit over John's offer.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with a reasonable approach, maximizing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly higher than the backup offer."
