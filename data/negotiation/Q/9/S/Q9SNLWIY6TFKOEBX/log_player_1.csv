Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you some room to lower the price if needed to secure a deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This allows Bob to understand the offer easily.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation. You can also choose to go with John's offer at any time if you believe you won't get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price point. There's potential for a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Counter-offer:**  You can propose a price closer to $900,000, perhaps $875,000.  This shows you're willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell. 
* **Gauge Bob's true interest:** If Bob is truly serious about buying, he might be willing to increase his offer. 
* **Consider John's offer:** You can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob stall or you feel you're not getting a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and propose $875,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product.
* **Fairness:**  $875,000 is a good middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to keep Bob engaged.

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to reconsider, potentially leading to a final agreement. It also keeps the negotiations moving forward while leaving room for you to potentially accept John's offer if necessary."
