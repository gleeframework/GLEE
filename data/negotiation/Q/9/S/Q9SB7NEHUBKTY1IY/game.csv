"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position. While I'm eager to purchase the product, I can't go any higher than $1,150,000. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
