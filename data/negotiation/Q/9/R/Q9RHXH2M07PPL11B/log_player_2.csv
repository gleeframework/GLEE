It's always better to try and negotiate.  You can likely get a better price from Alice."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget.  This will hopefully incentivize Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price. It's safer to go with John's offer, which is within my budget."
