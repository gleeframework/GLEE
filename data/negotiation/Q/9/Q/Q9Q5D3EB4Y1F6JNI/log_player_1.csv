Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives you a good chance of maximizing your profit. Here's why:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  $11,500 is more than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, so he might be willing to negotiate.
* **Lower than your floor:** It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, allowing room for negotiation if necessary.
* **Good incentive for Bob:**  Bob might see this as a good deal compared to the potential of losing out altogether.

If Bob rejects, you can go to John and get your minimum price of $12,000."
