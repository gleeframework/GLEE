"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite at $75. How about we compromise at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $78, but that's my absolute limit.  Do we have a deal?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $78 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to go down to $82, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",82.0,Alice,7,
