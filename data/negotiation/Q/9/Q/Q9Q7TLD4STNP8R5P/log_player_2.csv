"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite at $75. How about we compromise at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $78, but that's my absolute limit.  Do we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $78 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to go down to $82, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $80, and you've already managed to get her down to $82. John offers a sure thing at $80.  It's better to secure the product at a price you know is good than to risk not getting it at all."
