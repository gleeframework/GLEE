Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can do $900,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and even if she did, the savings would be minimal compared to the risk of her ending the negotiation.  John's guaranteed price of $800,000 is the best option now."
