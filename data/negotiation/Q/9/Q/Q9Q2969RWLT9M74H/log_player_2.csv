"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$11,000 is still too high for you. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price, especially since you have the option to buy from John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, even with her final concession.  You've reached your negotiation limit and it's time to cut your losses and purchase from John for a guaranteed lower price."
