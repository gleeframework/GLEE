"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $2000000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1500000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer and meet you in the middle. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
