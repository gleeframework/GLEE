Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is greater than your minimum of $80. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go up to $120 if Bob is willing.
* **It's a reasonable initial offer:** It's less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay, leaving some room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80 for the product. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is less than the initial offer I made, it's still a good deal for me. It's higher than my minimum selling price of $80, and it's possible that Bob will reject further counteroffers, making selling to John for $80 the only option."
