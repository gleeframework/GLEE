Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1,000. So, the total value you'll get is $10,000. I think this is a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: While Alice is trying to sweeten the deal with extras, her core price remains too high.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $12,000 is the most financially sound decision, even if it means missing out on potential added value from Alice's offer."
