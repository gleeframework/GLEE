Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a few things:

* **My minimum:** It's above my minimum value of $1,500,000, leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Bob's value:** It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** It allows for room to negotiate further if Bob rejects the initial offer, giving me a chance to increase the price.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal with Bob."

Bob's offer:
