Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I understand its value to you, my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle - how about $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to keep the cost below $975,000. Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $950,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  It's time to take John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
