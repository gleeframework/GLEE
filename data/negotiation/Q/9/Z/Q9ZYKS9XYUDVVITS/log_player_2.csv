"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price. You know the product is worth $80 to her, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $105 is closer to your desired price, it's still above what you're willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and you have more rounds to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $95. How about $110? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$110 is still too high, but it's getting closer. It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $100.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I've already met you at $110, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $115? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $115.  It's getting close to your limit, but you have only a few rounds left. It's better to go with John at $120 to ensure you get the product.  You might save a bit more by continuing to negotiate, but there's a risk you won't be able to reach an agreement with Alice in time."
