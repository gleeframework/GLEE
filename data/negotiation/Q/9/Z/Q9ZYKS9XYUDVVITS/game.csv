"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,105.0
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $95. How about $110? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $100.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",100.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,115.0
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I've already met you at $110, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $115? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,7,,
