"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $160?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. It's a great product, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $160, so I'd be willing to pay $140. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $180, just like you did from $200. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $135. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle between $170 and $135, which would be $152.50? It's a bit lower than my initial price, but still a good deal for both of us.",152.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $152.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $135, so I'd be willing to pay $142.50. Can you consider that?",142.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you halfway from $152.50, just like you did from $135. How about we meet in the middle at $147.25? It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",147.25,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $135, so I'd be willing to pay $141.25. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",141.25,Bob,10,
