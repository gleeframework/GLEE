"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. To make this work, I'd need to get the price down to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
