Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm offering it at a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is priced significantly below my minimum ($1,000,000) but well above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price point that's still highly profitable for me."
