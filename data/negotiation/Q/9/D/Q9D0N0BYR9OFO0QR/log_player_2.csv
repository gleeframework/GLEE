"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $14000.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $15,000.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is a good deal, but Bob can still save $1,000 by rejecting the offer and buying from John."
