Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $8000 is below my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, which is my absolute minimum for this product. If we can agree on that price, I'm happy to finalize the deal with you.

Round 9

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.
