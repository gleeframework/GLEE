Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $160, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $155, and it makes more sense for me to take the guaranteed deal from John at $150."
