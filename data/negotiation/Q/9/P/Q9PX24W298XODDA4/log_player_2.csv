"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. I believe it can significantly enhance your experience and productivity. For this exceptional opportunity, I am offering the product at a special introductory price of $12000. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a backup option with John for a lower price.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate further. I propose a revised price of $10500 for the product. This still reflects its high value and quality, while accommodating your financial considerations. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Since John offers a guaranteed lower price, it's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and explore if he can get a lower price from Alice in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if this works for you. "", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value of the product and the discussions we've had, I am prepared to offer the product at $9800. I hope this revised price meets your requirements and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice has come down to $9,800, which is lower than the price from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at a good price without risking going back and forth with Alice and potentially ending up paying more than he's willing to."
