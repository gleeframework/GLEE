"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be reasonable here. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.  Let's make it happen!",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $127.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm really hoping we can make a deal.",127.5,Bob,6,
