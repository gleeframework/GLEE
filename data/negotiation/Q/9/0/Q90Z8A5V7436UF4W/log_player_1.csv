"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it that low. I'll see if I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be reasonable here. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $127.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm really hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that we're getting into a price war and he may continue to lowball me. Additionally, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. So, I'm going to sell to John and cut my losses."
