Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $950,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) between your minimum and Bob's maximum. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept."
