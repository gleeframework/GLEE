"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant sum. To start negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but your starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I believe $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Could you consider a price of $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the reply. I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off on that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
