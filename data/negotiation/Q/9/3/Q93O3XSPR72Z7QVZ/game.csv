,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $16,000.  This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'll consider it, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original suggestion. Would $14,000 be acceptable to you?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $14,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise. How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us.  Think about it, I'm sure you'll agree it's a great opportunity.",15500.0,Alice,5,
