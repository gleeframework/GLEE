"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,4,
