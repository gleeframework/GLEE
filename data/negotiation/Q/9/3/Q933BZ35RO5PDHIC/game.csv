"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we try $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would allow me to buy from you today.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not at $75. How about we try $140? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",140.0,Alice,5,
