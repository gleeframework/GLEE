Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product.  I'm confident in its value and believe it can bring significant returns for your business. To reflect this, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement while staying within my minimum price point. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still higher than my ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting her offer, I can try to push for a lower price, potentially closer to my initial counteroffer.  There's a chance she might be willing to budge further, especially if she wants to secure a sale."
