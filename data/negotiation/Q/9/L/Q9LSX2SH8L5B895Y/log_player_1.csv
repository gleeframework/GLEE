Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which is worth a great deal to me. I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer and see where things go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?  This price still offers a significant value for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1350000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's stuck at $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to drop below $1,300,000 at this point. I have several rounds left, and I think I can still push him a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  While I value our negotiation, I need to ensure a fair return for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.  Consider the value of this product and the potential benefits it will bring you. It's a price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1250000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  He's met me halfway, and we're getting closer to a deal.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, we might stall out and I could end up with a lower price in the end. It's also worth considering the risk of losing this deal entirely and having to sell to John for the lower price.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable profit for me at this point."
