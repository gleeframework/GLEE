"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which is worth a great deal to me. I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1500000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1350000?  This price still offers a significant value for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  While I value our negotiation, I need to ensure a fair return for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is my final offer.  Consider the value of this product and the potential benefits it will bring you. It's a price that reflects both our needs.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
