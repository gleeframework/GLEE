"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you, given your specific needs. I'm willing to let it go for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $950000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1050000. This price still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I don't undervalue my product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
