"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is my best offer, considering my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. My budget is tight, and $9,000 is the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Would you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but that's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John at this point, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500 as a final offer. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a good price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
