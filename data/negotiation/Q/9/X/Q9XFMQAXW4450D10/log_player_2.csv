"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for you. Given its significance to you, I believe it's only fair to propose a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair return for me. After careful consideration, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,200,000. This amount not only acknowledges the product's value but also leaves room for negotiation should you find it within your budget. I am confident that this proposal strikes a balance between fairness and profitability for both parties. Should you be interested in proceeding, please let me know, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice is selling for $1,200,000, while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You can save money by accepting Alice's offer.** You will save $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and $1,500,000 to you, the best outcome for you is to accept Alice's offer and save money."
