"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand you see value in the product, but $600,000 is significantly below its worth.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see some movement on your side as well.  How about we consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still too far from where I see the value of this product. To be candid, I have another offer in hand that's much closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to give you one more opportunity to meet a reasonable price point.  Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being transparent. I understand you have other offers, but I have a firm budget. If you're willing to close this today, I can offer $760,000. That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the circumstances.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $760,000 doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to make a final compromise at $825,000.  This is my absolute best offer - if it doesn't work, I'll have to proceed with the other offer I mentioned.",825000.0,Alice,7,
