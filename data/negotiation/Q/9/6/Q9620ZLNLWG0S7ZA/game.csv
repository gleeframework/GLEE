"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $150. How about we try $180? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $160, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $160?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $170? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $170 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $170, which would be $165. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $165?",165.0,Bob,6,
