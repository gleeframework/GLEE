"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but it's not the best possible.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** There's no rush to accept the first offer. 
* **Buying from John is a safe fallback.** If the negotiation doesn't go well, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product. 

By rejecting the offer, you can explore if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm happy to pay $700,000, which reflects the value I'm placing on the product at this stage. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's not an unreasonable starting point. It demonstrates that you are serious about getting a good deal.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the value you see in the product while emphasizing your current price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an invitation for further discussion, keeping the negotiation open. 

This approach aims to initiate a back-and-forth negotiation while maintaining a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to negotiate:** Her counteroffer shows flexibility, and she's moved closer to your initial counteroffer.
* **There's still room for improvement:**  While $750,000 is a good price, you're still aiming for the lowest possible price. 
* **You have time on your side:** You have several rounds remaining, and it's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price. 

Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Given the value we both see in this product, I'd like to offer $725,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** This counteroffer moves the price closer to Alice's offer, showing a genuine desire to find common ground.
* **Strong Position:** $725,000 is still a significant saving for you, but it's closer to Alice's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise while maintaining your goal of saving money.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the mutual value of the product, fostering a cooperative negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $735,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and the gap is now relatively small.
* **Good Price:** $735,000 is a good price considering your initial goal of saving as much money as possible. It's a significant discount from both your initial offer and John's price.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If you reject this offer, there's a risk that you won't be able to reach an agreement with Alice before the 10 rounds are over, leaving you with the less desirable option of buying from John.

While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of not securing the product at this price is too high. Accepting the offer is the most sensible option at this point."
