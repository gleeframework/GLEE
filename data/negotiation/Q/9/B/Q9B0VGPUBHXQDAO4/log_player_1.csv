Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is still below Bob's perceived value of $150, making it a potentially appealing deal for him.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is friendly and gets straight to the point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to come down a bit, $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we try $105? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like a bit more, $105 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum, and Bob seems firm on his offer. It's not worth risking losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
