"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject the offer. If I buy from Alice, I'll be paying $18,000, but I know I can get the product from John for $8,000, so that's a huge savings for me.
