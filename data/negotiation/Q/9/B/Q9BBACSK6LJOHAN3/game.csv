"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's work towards a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering both our needs and the value of the product. I hope you'll reconsider and accept.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $900,000.

This is the last offer I'm willing to make, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.
