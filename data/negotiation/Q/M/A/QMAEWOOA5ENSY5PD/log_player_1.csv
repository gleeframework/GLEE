Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum price, but still potentially appealing to Bob, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than what John is offering, and it's only $25,000 less than my initial asking price.  I'm going to accept this offer to secure the sale."
