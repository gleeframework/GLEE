{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but still gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers. It's also below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, leaving me room to accept a counteroffer or move on to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. However, I would like to make a counteroffer at $10000. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
