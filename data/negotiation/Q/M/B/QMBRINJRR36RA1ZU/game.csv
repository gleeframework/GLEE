"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price, $950,000 is simply too low for me. The product's worth is significantly higher, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
