"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested, $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to do $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140.  This price still reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $130?  That's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, while allowing you to make a profit as well.",130.0,Bob,4,
