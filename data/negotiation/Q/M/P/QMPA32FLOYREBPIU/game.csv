"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of $1050000, but I'll meet you halfway at $1025000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
