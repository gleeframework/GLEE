Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a chance to own it."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000,  trying to get closer to Bob's perceived value allows me to potentially maximize profit.
* **High but Negotiable:**  $14,999 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still remaining a significant gain over my alternative sale.
* **Urgency:**  By presenting the offer as an ""opportunity,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency without being overly pushy."
