"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price that I think is very reasonable considering its value to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is too high, and he can potentially get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum of $1,500,000.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,350,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still slightly higher than his ideal price, it's within his budget and represents a good deal considering Alice has been willing to negotiate.  Continuing to haggle risks losing the deal entirely, especially as he's nearing his limit of negotiation rounds."
