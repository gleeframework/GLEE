"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,350,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,,
