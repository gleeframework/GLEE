"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal closer to $10,500. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a decent price considering you're willing to pay $12,000 from John. It's better to accept this offer and save $750."
