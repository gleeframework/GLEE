{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and encourages Alice to consider a lower price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $550,000 is closer to my target, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my negotiation position."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate.  I'm not willing to risk buying from John yet, as there's a good chance I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to show I'm serious about buying the product.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, but it's still lower than Alice's current offer.  I'm hoping that this will encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much from her initial position.  I'm still hoping to get a better price, and I have a few rounds left to try.  Buying from John at $800,000 is still a last resort, and I want to exhaust all other options before I do that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to push my counteroffer up to $550,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. We are getting close to the middle ground. I'm hoping that this shows my willingness to compromise, and encourages Alice to reconsider her position.  

If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to buy from John in the next round if she continues to be inflexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice is stubbornly refusing to lower her price.  Buying from John for $800,000 is still cheaper than accepting Alice's current offer. I need to secure the product, and there is no guarantee that Alice will accept my next counteroffer. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
