Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me a decent margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $110. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit."
