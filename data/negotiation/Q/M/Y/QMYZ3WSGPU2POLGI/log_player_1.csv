Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a strong starting point,  but I'm open to negotiation if Bob is willing to counter. I want to gauge his interest and see what kind of value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but still a good price for me. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth continuing the negotiation.  I'll take John's offer and sell for $1,000,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
