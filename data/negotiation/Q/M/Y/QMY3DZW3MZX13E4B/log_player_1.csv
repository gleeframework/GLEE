``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90.  While it's tempting to sell quickly, $90 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."

I'm offering $130.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $100. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm offering $125. This is a slight reduction from my last offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
