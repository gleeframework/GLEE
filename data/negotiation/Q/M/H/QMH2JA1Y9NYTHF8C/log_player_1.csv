"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm testing the waters with a significant markup.  If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer, or if he's truly only willing to pay that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway or if he's truly firm on $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's still not close enough to my desired price. I'm hoping to get him to budge a little more, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my last serious attempt to get a better price from Bob.  It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and only $50,000 above John's offer. If Bob rejects, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is stuck at $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to go lower. I've made my best offer and he's not budging. It's time to move on. John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a safer and more profitable option."
