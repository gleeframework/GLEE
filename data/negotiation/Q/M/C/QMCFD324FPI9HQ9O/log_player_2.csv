"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we start the conversation at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation.  
* You know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000, so there's no risk of losing the product entirely.
* By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price, potentially closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
