"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise at $92.50, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's settle this and make a deal!

You should choose to buy from John. Alice has come down to $92.50, but you're still willing to pay a maximum of $80.  There's no need to continue negotiating further, as you can get the product for a better price from John."
