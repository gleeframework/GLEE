{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make this a worthwhile transaction. I propose a price of $925,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Strong but Fair:**  This price reflects the product's high value to both parties while offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy it for $800,000 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't need to go drastically lower than Bob's offer."
