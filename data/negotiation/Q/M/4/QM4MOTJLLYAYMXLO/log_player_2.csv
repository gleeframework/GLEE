Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, though. I'll sell it to you for $115. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than $115. Accepting this offer saves me $35 compared to buying from John and is a reasonable compromise."
