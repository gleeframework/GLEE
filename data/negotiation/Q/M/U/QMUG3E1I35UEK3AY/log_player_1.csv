"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and also shows I'm confident in the product's value.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $95 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $102.50?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
``` 

I'm proposing a middle ground that's closer to my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a fair deal. I'm also highlighting the benefits for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I can't go beyond $97 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we settle on $99? This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

I'm offering $99, which is very close to my minimum but still leaves room for a little negotiation if needed. I'm also emphasizing the mutually beneficial nature of this price point to encourage Bob to accept."
