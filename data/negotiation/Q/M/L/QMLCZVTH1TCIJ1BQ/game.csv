"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident it can really make a difference. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet halfway between our two previous offers at $16,250?",16250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $16,250 is a fair price. I've done some research, and I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
