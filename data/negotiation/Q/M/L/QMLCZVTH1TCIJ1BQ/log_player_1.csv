Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident it can really make a difference. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet halfway between our two previous offers at $16,250?"", ""product_price"": 16250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $16,250 is a fair price. I've done some research, and I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not showing willingness to move much higher than $12,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
