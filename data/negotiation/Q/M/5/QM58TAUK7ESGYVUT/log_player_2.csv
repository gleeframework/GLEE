"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're looking to pay no more than $120, and Alice's offer is $100. 
* You can likely get a better price by negotiating, so rejecting the initial offer is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to pay as little as possible, but also want to make a reasonable counteroffer that Alice might accept. 
* Offering $90 is a good starting point, as it's halfway between your desired price of $80 and Alice's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $95, which is within your desired range of $120. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $25 compared to buying from John, and is a good compromise. 
* Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal or wasting time is not worth it."
