"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great value for the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's lower than the product's worth to Alice, it's above Bob's maximum price point. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. He can either make another counteroffer or simply buy the product from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While Alice has been willing to negotiate, it seems like she is unlikely to go any lower. Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the best course of action to accept John's offer and save himself $250,000."
