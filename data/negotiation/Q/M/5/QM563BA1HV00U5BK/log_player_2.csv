"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration and evaluation of its value, I propose to sell this product to you for $12,000. This price reflects my commitment to ensuring you receive a high-quality item while allowing me to fairly compensate for the investment made into acquiring it. I am confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide substantial value to you. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss further, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $12,000 is less than your maximum of $15,000.
* **You save money compared to John:** Buying from Alice saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential savings."
