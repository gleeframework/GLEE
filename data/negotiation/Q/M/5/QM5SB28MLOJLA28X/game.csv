"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
