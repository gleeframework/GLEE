I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, giving me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering $10,500.  This is still above Bob's value for the product, but lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him for $10,000."
