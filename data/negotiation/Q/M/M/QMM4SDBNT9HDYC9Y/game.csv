"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000. Would you be open to discussing that?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $825000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $800000. This feels like a fair price considering the value we've discussed and the opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $850000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
