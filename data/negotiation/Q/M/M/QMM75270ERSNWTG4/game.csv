"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to work within my budget. Would you consider $800,000? This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't sell this product for less than $1,600,000.  This is my final offer â€“ I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value you'll gain. Let me know if you're willing to make a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
