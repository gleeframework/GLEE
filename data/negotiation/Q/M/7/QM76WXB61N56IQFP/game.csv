,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I'd be happy to pay $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm happy to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and move forward together.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a price of $1,140,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1140000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,140,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm going to stick to my last offer of $1,125,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm committed to closing this deal, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,8,
