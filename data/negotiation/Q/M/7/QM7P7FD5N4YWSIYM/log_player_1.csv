Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire an asset that aligns perfectly with your needs."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit, but leave room for negotiation:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 aims to maximize profit while still leaving Bob with a potential gain ($100,000).
* **Strong but not greedy:** Starting too high (close to $1,200,000) might scare Bob away, while going too low leaves potential profit on the table. 
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's benefits for Bob, aiming to increase his perceived value and justify the price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the safety net of selling to John at her desired price."
