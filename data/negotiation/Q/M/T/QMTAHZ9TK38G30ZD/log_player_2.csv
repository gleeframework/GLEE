"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than the $10,000 John is asking, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on 8800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $8,800.**  This is closer to Bob's ideal price of $8,500.
* **Buying from John is still more expensive at $10,000.** 
* **Negotiating further might be possible, but there's risk.**  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but she might also walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point. Bob gets the product for a price he's willing to pay and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
