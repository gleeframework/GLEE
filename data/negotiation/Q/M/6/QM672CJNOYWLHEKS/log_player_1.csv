Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know for sure that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. If she did, she could push closer to that number. 
* Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice needs to be prepared with her minimum acceptable price (which shouldn't be lower than John's offer of $800,000)."
