# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to a budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $120. How about we try $105? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John for $100 guarantees the best price."
