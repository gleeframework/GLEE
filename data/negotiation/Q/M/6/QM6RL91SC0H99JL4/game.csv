"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $120? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget though.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to a budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $120. How about we try $105? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
