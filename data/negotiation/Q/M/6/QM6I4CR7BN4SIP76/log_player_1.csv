Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. Given the value of $800,000 to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can secure a higher price from Bob or John.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value our potential partnership,  $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $875,000, acknowledging the value you place on the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on your price, but $875,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and the potential of our partnership.  I believe this offer is fair and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum threshold of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  the risk of further negotiation falling through with Bob and then having to settle for John's offer at $800,000 is too high.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a good deal."
