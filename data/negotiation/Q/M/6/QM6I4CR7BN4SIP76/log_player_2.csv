"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. Given the value of $800,000 to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value our potential partnership,  $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $875,000, acknowledging the value you place on the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. He can likely get a better price with more negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on your price, but $875,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and the potential of our partnership.  I believe this offer is fair and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
