Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, selling to Bob quickly at a higher price might be preferable. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob."
