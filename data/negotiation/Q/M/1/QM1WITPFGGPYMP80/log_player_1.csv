Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,900,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. This keeps the door open for negotiation.
* **Justification of value:** While I don't explicitly state why the price is above Bob's perceived value, the language hints at additional benefits or exclusivity that might justify the higher price in his mind.

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, with a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I'm willing to take that risk for the potential to earn an additional $400,000."
