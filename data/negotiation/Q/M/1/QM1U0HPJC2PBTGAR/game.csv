"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000.

Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,275,000. This is already a very competitive price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the terms of the sale.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
