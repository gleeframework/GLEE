Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Exploit Perceived Value Gap:** Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value ($8,000) if he believes the product is a good deal. 
* **Secure Backup Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob."
