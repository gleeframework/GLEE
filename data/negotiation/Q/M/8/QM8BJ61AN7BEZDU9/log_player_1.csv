"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is genuinely interested and has a high perceived value for the product. If he rejects, we'll have room to negotiate down.  However, I'm keeping the price above my minimum of $800,000 to ensure a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $850,000? This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. Bob has offered my minimum price, and I'm getting the best possible deal right now. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better deal, but it also carries the risk of losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure the sale at my minimum price than risk getting a lower offer or having Bob walk away completely."
