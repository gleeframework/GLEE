"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in.  I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'd need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I'm flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $120 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $130 - I think that's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",130.0,Alice,5,
