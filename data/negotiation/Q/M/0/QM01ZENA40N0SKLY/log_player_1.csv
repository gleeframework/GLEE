Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $12,000}

This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. After considering the options, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but lower than my initial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

My counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $11,000}

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'm still willing to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've sent a counteroffer to Bob. Here it is again:

{""product_price"": $11,000}

I'm waiting to hear back from Bob and see if he's willing to accept this offer or make a counteroffer of his own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is now at $10,000, which is the same price John is willing to pay. I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm willing to sell the product to John for $10,000, as it's the same price I could get from Bob and it's a guaranteed sale. I'll sell the product to John and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
