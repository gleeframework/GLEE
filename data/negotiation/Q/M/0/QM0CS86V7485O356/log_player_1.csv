"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than what I think it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **First Round:** It's important to start strong and see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting his offer allows for continued negotiation. I believe I can get a better price. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can maximize my profits by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes the idea of a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Progress:** I'm making progress towards a deal without falling below my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $90? That's closer to what I'm comfortable paying. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob has increased his offer to $90, which is very close to my minimum price of $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's a risk of losing the deal completely. 
* **Time Constraints:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit and avoids the potential of a deal falling through with John. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision at this point. It secures a profit and avoids unnecessary risks."
