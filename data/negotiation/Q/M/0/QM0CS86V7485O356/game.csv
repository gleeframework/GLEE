"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $90? That's closer to what I'm comfortable paying. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
