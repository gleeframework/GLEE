"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to offer $140 for the product.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50? This is a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to offer $145 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
