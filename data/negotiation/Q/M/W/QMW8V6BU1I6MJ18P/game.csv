"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $1520000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll be getting.",1520000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1520000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm counteroffering at $1450000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
