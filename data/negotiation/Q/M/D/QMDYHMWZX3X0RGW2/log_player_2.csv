"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be really interested in. My asking price is $95, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $95.  It's a good starting point, but I can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $95 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  This would give us both a fair deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer of $90 is closer to my budget than John's price of $100.  While I'd love to get it for $85, I'm happy to split the difference."
