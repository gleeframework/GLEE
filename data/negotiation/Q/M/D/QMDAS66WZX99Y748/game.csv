"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's priced at $17,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. However, $17,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000 on this product.  Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price between my offer and yours?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,000.  This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to own a valuable product.  Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Is there any room to meet in the middle?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us.  $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This would be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.  What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,7,
