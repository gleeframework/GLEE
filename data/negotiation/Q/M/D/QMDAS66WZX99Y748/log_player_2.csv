"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's priced at $17,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $17,000 is way above his budget and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. However, $17,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000 on this product.  Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is lower than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's budget.  He can get the product from John for $10,000, so he should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a price closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price between my offer and yours?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,000.  This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to own a valuable product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is still above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a price closer to his desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Is there any room to meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us.  $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This would be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his budget.  Since he has the option to buy the product for a lower price from John, it's the most financially responsible decision at this point.  He's already spent a good amount of time negotiating and is running out of rounds."
