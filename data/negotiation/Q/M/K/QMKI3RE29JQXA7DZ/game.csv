"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
