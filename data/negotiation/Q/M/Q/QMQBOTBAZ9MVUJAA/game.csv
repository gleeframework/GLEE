"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $19,000 is simply too high for me.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $12,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway?  Would you be open to $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",14000.0,Bob,4,
