Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product.  While I'm eager to find a fair price, $10,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but  $12,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  To be honest, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I believe you'd get great use out of this product. How about we make this our final offer: $16,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.
