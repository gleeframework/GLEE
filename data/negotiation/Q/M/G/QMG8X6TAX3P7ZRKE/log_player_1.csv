Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
