Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering the product significantly below this price to Bob leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above your minimum.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:**  While $1,350,000 is a high price, it is still significantly less than your minimum acceptable price and leaves you with a substantial profit margin. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob may try to negotiate the price down. By starting high, you give yourself flexibility in the negotiation while ensuring you don't sell yourself short. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the opportunity to sell the product at your desired price to John."
