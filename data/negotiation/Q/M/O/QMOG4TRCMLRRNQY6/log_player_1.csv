{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate to secure a sale. I've offered a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and even lower than my initial offer. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a price that's so far below what I consider fair. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,800 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,200? That's still a good deal for you and closer to what I need to get."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,200. How about $10,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm getting the feeling that Bob isn't willing to come up to a price that's fair for me.  I'm better off selling to John for $12,000."
