"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value this product offers is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value you're placing on the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to $1,200,000.  While it's a good profit, we still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to our initial offer. We are also aware that Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us leverage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,275,000. This is a significant concession on my end and represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now moving away from his previous offers and is significantly lowering his price. This indicates he may be willing to settle somewhere between his offer and our last offer. We still have room to negotiate and aim for a better price than $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to agree to $1,212,500.  This represents a significant price cut on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1212500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference between his last offer ($1,150,000) and our last offer ($1,275,000).  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong price. We're moving towards the later rounds, so conveying urgency and a desire to close the deal is important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Time to make the deal.  While we'd prefer a higher price, we are in the late stages of negotiation. Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer from here, and the difference between his offer and John's standing offer is no longer significant enough to risk losing the sale.  Accepting $1,100,000 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of missing out entirely if Bob walks away."
