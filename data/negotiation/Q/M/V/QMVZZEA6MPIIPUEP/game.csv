"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this acquisition. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe this asset is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential for return on your investment.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,450,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
