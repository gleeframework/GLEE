Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your top offer, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but it's still above what you're comfortable paying. With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.  You've already spent a lot of time negotiating with Alice, and while you're close, there's no guarantee you'll reach a deal. It's safer to go with John's offer and secure the product for your target price."
