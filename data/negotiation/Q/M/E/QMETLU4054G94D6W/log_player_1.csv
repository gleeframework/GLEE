Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm confident I can secure a deal at a price above my minimum $1,500,000, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of rounds. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm satisfied with securing my minimum price."
