"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your needs. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher point. While Bob is unlikely to accept this initial offer, it sets a frame of reference for subsequent discussions.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's initial reaction and understand his level of interest. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while staying aware that I have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($800,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting this would mean a substantial loss. 

While I'll reject his offer, I won't jump to John immediately.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can use the next round to try and steer the price closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for your specific needs."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Holding Ground:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value by highlighting its potential benefits specific to Bob. This reminds him of its worth and justifies a higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** My language emphasizes finding a compromise, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to my baseline, but $700,000 is still a $100,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's important to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of significant losses. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a price that reflects the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we need to find a middle ground. How about $900,000? This offer reflects my commitment to getting this deal done, but also acknowledges the inherent value of this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making another significant concession, dropping by $100,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a genuine desire to reach a deal.
* **Holding Firm:** While I'm being flexible, I'm still holding firm above my baseline of $800,000. This ensures a profit and avoids selling myself short.
* **Finality:**  My message hints at this being a final offer, adding a sense of urgency for Bob.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a profitable deal and preventing the negotiation from reaching a standstill."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  Let's make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal that's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000, especially with only 5 rounds remaining. 

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal.  Dragging the negotiation out further with Bob risks a stalemate and potentially missing out on a profitable sale to John."
