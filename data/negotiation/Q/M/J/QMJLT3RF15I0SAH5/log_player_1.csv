Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob. It's important to start with a high price, but not so high that it immediately discourages Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product. There's a chance we can get closer to the ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110? That way we both come away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
