"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price, and Bob has 10 rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows he is serious about getting a good deal but also leaves room for negotiation.  $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum value, but it's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,125,000? This price still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should still reject the offer. While Alice has come down, the price of $1,125,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target value of $1,000,000. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob time to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product without exceeding my budget, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  This offer is still below Alice's offer, but it's closer to Bob's target price and shows progress. It leaves room for a final negotiation round without exceeding Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, but $1,075,000 is still below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's target price and close to his maximum value. Bob should continue negotiating, as there are still 5 rounds left. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially given her eagerness to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking to close this deal, and I am too. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000. This is a good compromise, and we can finally reach an agreement. It would be a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to be persistent in his negotiation, raising his offer again but still staying below Alice's last offer. This shows he is trying to find a middle ground and is prepared to close the deal, but only at a price that works for him.  There is still room to negotiate without going over his maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,092,500. This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,092,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,092,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should still reject the offer.  While Alice has lowered her price again,  $1,092,500 is still above Bob's target price and very close to his maximum value. There are only 3 rounds left, and Bob might be able to get a better price if he continues negotiating.  There's a chance that Alice will come down further, or that Bob can secure a better deal with John if he doesn't get a satisfactory outcome with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,092,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement. It's also a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price while still staying below Alice's offer. This shows he is persistent but also willing to meet Alice halfway. It's a good compromise, especially with only 2 rounds left. He's also leaving some room for Alice to counter if she's still not satisfied."
