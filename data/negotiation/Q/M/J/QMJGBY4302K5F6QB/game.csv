"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much to you. Let's close this deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,125,000? This price still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this happen.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product without exceeding my budget, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, but $1,075,000 is still below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to close this deal, and I am too. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000. This is a good compromise, and we can finally reach an agreement. It would be a good price for both of us. What do you say?",1085000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,092,500. This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's get this done.",1092500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,092,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement. It's also a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1087500.0,Bob,8,
