,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can both benefit from a deal at this price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I think $125 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll appreciate it in the long run.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go. I think we're close enough to make a deal work.",115.0,Bob,6,
