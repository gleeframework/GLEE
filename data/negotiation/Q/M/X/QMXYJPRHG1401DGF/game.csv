"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is fair for both of us. It's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a competitive price. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
