"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit, and it's within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. This is a compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10900.0,Alice,5,
