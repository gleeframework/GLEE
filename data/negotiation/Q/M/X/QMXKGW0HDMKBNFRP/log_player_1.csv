"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm at his maximum price of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from him in subsequent rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit without further negotiation."
