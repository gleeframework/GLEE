"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly below my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and the fact that I am willing to close the deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $912,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",912500.0,Alice,5,
