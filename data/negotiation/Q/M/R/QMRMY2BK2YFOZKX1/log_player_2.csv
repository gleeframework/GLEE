"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly less than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is too expensive:**  While John offers the product, it's above my maximum budget. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly below my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too low:** While closer to my budget, $900,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth to me.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** I have 7 rounds left, giving me time to push for a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is too expensive:**  I'm still committed to getting the best deal possible, and John's price remains above my limit.

**Next Step:**  I will counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and the fact that I am willing to close the deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $912,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my desired price:**  $912,500 is only $12,500 away from my last counteroffer of $925,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 5, and I only have 5 rounds remaining. It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers and risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Buying from John is still too expensive:**  Even though John is an option, his price is significantly higher than what Alice is offering.

**Next Step:** I will accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price within my budget."
