"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal, but I can't go lower than that.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $10500 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10500 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I am willing to pay $11000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it is fair and within your asking price range.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your final offer, but $11000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $11250.  This represents a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do given the value of the product.  If we can reach an agreement, I'm sure we'll both be happy.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've carefully considered your offers and I am willing to pay $11125 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the item while keeping within my budget.",11125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11125 is still a bit short of what I need.  Given that we're nearing the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to make a final concession and accept $11200 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",11200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've thought about it and I am willing to pay $11150 for the product. I hope this meets your needs and allows us to close this deal.",11150.0,Bob,10,
