"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Offering a ""deal"":**  I'm framing the price as a good deal for Bob, which might make him more receptive to negotiating. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, so I have room to lower the price if necessary. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to maximize my profit while still closing the deal. I'm starting high and hoping to reach a price point that's satisfactory to both of us.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take the $10,000, it's not a good deal for me. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm going to be firm but open to finding a compromise that works for both of us.  I have eight rounds left, so I have time to explore different negotiation strategies."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal, but I can't go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price.  $11,000 is halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and his offer ($10,000).
* **Flexibility:** I'm stressing that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm establishing a firm lower limit. This signals that I'm serious about closing the deal but won't undervalue my product.
* **Direct language:**  I'm using clear and direct language to convey my position and make it clear what I'm expecting from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that by offering a compromise and demonstrating flexibility, I can entice Bob to accept my counteroffer. This would allow me to get closer to my desired profit margin while still closing the deal.  If he rejects, I'll continue to adjust my offer based on his responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $10500 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $15,000. While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept anything below my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer. I want to make a more substantial counteroffer than my previous one, as Bob seems open to negotiating.  I have six rounds remaining, so I have time to explore further compromises and find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm maintaining my stance that $10,500 is too low, but I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my offer to $11,500. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""Let's meet in the middle"" and ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This round is crucial. By meeting Bob halfway again, I'm showing flexibility while also sticking to my minimum price point. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider whether it's more advantageous to sell to John or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I am willing to pay $11000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it is fair and within your asking price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to receive for the product. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's below my minimum expectation, and I have time left in the negotiation to explore other options.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.  I still have four rounds left, and I believe I can reach a more favorable outcome. I'm hoping that by demonstrating my willingness to compromise, I can convince Bob to raise his offer further. However, I'm also prepared to walk away from the deal if it becomes clear that we can't find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your final offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This represents a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do given the value of the product.  If we can reach an agreement, I'm sure we'll both be happy."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,250, demonstrating that I'm still willing to negotiate. This small adjustment shows flexibility while still staying within my minimum range.
* **Fairness and Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" and highlighting the benefits for both of us, hoping to make it more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language and encouraging a sense of cooperation to create a more amicable negotiating atmosphere.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I need to carefully weigh my options. I'm hoping this small compromise will convince Bob to accept the offer, as it gets me closer to my goal and allows me to avoid selling to John. However, if he rejects, I'll have to reassess the situation and potentially consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my deadline."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,125 is a slight improvement, it's still below my desired price point. I have two rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my target.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer. I want to see if I can push for a price that's closer to my minimum. If Bob rejects, I'll be forced to decide between selling to John for $15,000 or walking away from the deal."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,125 is still a bit short of what I need.  Given that we're nearing the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to make a final concession and accept $11,200 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Explanation:**

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,150 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. This is the final round, and I'm not willing to risk getting a worse deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me a higher price, and I'm confident that I can find another buyer for the product in the future if I need to.

**Strategy:**

My priority is to maximize my profit. Even though I've invested time in negotiating with Bob, I'm choosing the option that gives me the best financial outcome.  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
