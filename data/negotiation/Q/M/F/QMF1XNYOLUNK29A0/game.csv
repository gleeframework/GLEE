"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a big jump for me.  How about we try $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're still a bit apart.  $950,000 isn't quite enough for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,100,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us - you'd get a great deal on the product, and I'd be able to move forward with this sale. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. I'm getting closer to a point where I can make this work. How about $1,025,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in your product.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,025,000. It's a good step in the right direction. To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,150,000. This would be a fair compromise, as it's  closer to your last offer and still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
