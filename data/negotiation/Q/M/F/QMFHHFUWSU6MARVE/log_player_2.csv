You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $9,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still above your ideal price.  You can likely get the price down further by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

Alice's final offer is still a bit higher than what you'd like to pay, but it's close to your maximum price. It's also better than buying from John for $12,000.  Accepting the offer saves you money compared to John's offer, and it avoids potentially further negotiations with Alice that could lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
