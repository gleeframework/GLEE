"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering it for $90. This means you save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is profitable for her:**  She's willing to sell for $80, and you're offering $90. This means she makes a profit of $10.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for both parties."
