"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $13,000.  It's worth $15,000 to him, and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's below his maximum price of $15,000 and saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up paying the full $15,000 to John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal with a lower risk."
