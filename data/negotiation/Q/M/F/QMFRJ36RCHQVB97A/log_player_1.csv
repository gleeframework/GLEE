Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for potential negotiation. I'm keeping the option open to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
