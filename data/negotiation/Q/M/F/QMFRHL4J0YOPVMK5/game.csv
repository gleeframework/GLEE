"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm open to selling for $9,000. This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $8,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  I think this would be a good deal for both of us.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,875. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target price. How about we meet at $8,700?",8700.0,Bob,6,
