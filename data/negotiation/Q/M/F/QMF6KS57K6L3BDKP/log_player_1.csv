Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but slightly below John's offer leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Create Urgency (Implied):**  By not mentioning John directly, there's a subtle implication that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

This approach aims to capitalize on the most profitable scenario while still leaving a possibility for Bob to accept."
