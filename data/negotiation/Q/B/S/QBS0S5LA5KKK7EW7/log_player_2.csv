"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a highly valuable asset at a price that represents significant savings. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, you're still getting a good deal by paying $100,000 more than its value to her."
