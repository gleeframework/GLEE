Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's not something I can discuss in detail over this medium, but I'm confident its potential benefits far outweigh the asking price. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. If this is of interest, I'd be happy to schedule a meeting to discuss it further.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targetting a higher price:**  This offer is significantly higher than your guaranteed minimum ($1,500,000 from John). 
* **Creating urgency and exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the unique nature of the product and the opportunity for Bob to be the first to own it. This could trigger a sense of urgency and make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions a willingness to discuss the product further, leaving room for negotiation if Bob expresses interest but has concerns about the price.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob might be willing to pay more than John for the product. 
* The success of this approach depends on factors like the value of the product to Bob, his financial situation, and his negotiation skills.
* It's crucial to be prepared for a potential rejection.  If Bob declines, you can always fall back on the guaranteed offer from John."
