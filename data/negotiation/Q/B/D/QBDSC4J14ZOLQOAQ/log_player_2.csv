Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $665,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident that you'll find the product's value justifies the price. Let's finalize the deal at $665,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $665,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $665,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line. Continuing to negotiate might push her away, and while John is an option, saving $135,000 is significant. It's time to secure a good deal."
