Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Value & John:** While John guarantees $1,200,000, a faster sale to Bob at a slightly lower price might be preferable. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Alice, creating an opportunity to negotiate if Bob counters."
