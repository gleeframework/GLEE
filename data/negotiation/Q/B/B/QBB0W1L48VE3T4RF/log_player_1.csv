Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation or allows us to settle comfortably above Bob's valuation. 
* **Targeting above Bob's value:** The offer of $1,350,000 is a starting point aimed at maximizing profit.  
* **Alternative in mind:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that.
* **Confident messaging:** The tone suggests the product is worth the price without being overly aggressive.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Ideal scenario, we achieve a sale above Bob's perceived value.
* **Bob negotiates:**  This opens the door to finding a mutually agreeable price, likely somewhere between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000.
* **Bob rejects:** We move on to John and secure our guaranteed $1,500,000."
