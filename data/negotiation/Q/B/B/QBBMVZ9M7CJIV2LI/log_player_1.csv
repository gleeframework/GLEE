{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This initial offer is a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates a sense of urgency for Bob to accept the offer before I potentially sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10800 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I want to see if I can get him to go higher before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I can't go lower than $11,200. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $10900 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a little more to $11,000. This is really my final offer, as it's getting closer to my minimum. If you're still interested, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $10800 again. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting repetitive, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, as there are limited rounds left. I'm better off selling to John at this point and guaranteeing my minimum profit."
