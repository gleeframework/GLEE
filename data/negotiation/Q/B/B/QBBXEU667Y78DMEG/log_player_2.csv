"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($2,300,000 vs. $800,000). There's no reason to accept it immediately. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I recognize the product's value, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it still represents a fair value considering the potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my offer, highlighting my budget constraints and still acknowledging the product's value.
* **Maximum Offer:**  Stating this is my ""absolute maximum"" adds pressure and makes it clear I won't go any higher.
* **Fairness:**  By emphasizing the potential benefits, I'm subtly implying that even my offer is a good deal for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the price of $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential ROI.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I need to keep pushing for a lower price, as I'm still within my budget with John's offer.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows me to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within a strict price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and I'm confident this price is fair considering the potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but not drastically. This shows willingness to compromise without giving in too quickly.
* **Budget Justification:** I reiterate my budget constraints to emphasize my limited room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I highlight the potential benefits to subtly imply that even my offer is a good deal for Alice. 
* **Compromise:** I frame my offer as a ""significant compromise"" to make it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. While your offer is closer to a realistic valuation, we're still some distance apart.  Let's try this - I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high for me, and she's stated it's her final offer.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $800,000. While I'd like to get a lower price, I've already negotiated extensively and I'm not confident I can get Alice lower than $1,600,000."
