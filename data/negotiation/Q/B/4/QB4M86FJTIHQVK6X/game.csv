"I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $13,000. This is a fair price, considering I could get it for less from another seller.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $15,500, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
