Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price. How about $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $13,000. This is a fair price, considering I could get it for less from another seller."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 5

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $15,500, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
