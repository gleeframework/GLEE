"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $230. What do you think?",230.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $230 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $180 is still a bit out of my range though.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $110.  Would you consider $150? It's a fair offer, and ensures I'm not taking a loss.",150.0,Alice,5,
