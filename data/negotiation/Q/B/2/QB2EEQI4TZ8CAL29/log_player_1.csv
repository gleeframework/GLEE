Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its overall value. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but comfortably above your minimum ($800,000). This creates a win-win perception.
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob's input, fostering a sense of collaboration and increasing the chances of a successful deal. 

By starting with a strong but reasonable offer, Alice maximizes her potential profit while leaving space for negotiation if needed."
