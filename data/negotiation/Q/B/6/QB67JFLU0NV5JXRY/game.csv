"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's true value is significantly higher. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm willing to go a little higher, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me.  I'm offering $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
