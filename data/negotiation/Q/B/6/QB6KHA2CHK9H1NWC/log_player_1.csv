{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for the negotiation.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above my minimum:** $95 is higher than my minimum price of $80, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $95 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($100), making it a potentially attractive offer for him. 
* **It allows for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both of us to compromise if needed. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $85, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90.  Here's why:

* **It's a compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **It's still above my minimum:**  $90 is above my minimum selling price of $80, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **It shows flexibility:** By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.5. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $87.5 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $80 and still represents a decent profit for me.  

It's important to remember that continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  It's better to secure a sale that's within a reasonable range than to risk getting nothing at all."
