"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and I'd be willing to pay that amount right now. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise and a great price considering the value this product brings.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's a good deal for you as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
