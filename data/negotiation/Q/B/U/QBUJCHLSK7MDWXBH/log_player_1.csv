{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you are serious about selling but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and I'd be willing to pay that amount right now. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise and a great price considering the value this product brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's a good deal for you as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is not budging from his $1,000,000 offer. I've already lowered my price once and am not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a better outcome than selling to Bob for a much lower price."
