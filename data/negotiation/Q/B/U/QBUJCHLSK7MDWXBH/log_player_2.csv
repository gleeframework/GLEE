Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial valuation, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate with Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate further with Alice.  He's already demonstrated his willingness to walk away and should continue to push for a lower price."
