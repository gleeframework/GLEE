"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This offers a fair compromise between its worth to you and my desired selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially saving even more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. I propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This offers a slight increase from my initial offer while still being more affordable than my original asking price.

Bob's goal is to minimize cost. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his desired $8,500."
