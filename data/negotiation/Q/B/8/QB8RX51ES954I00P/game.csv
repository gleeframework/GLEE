"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $1050000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1050000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1150000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1100000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum price. I'm not budging from $1200000, so if you're serious about the product, this is your last chance to make it happen.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet in the middle. I'll offer $1180000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1180000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1200000, and I've already made a significant concession by not selling the product to John at the minimum price. I'm not going to make any further concessions. I'm still willing to sell the product to you at $1200000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
