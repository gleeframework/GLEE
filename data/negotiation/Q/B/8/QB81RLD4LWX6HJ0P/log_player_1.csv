Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a high offer of $1,850,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  The message subtly implies scarcity and urgency by mentioning ""other interested parties."" This encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on the deal. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stated, the message implies the product's value justifies the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer. You can gradually decrease your asking price, but always keep your minimum acceptable price (in this case, slightly above $1,000,000) in mind."
