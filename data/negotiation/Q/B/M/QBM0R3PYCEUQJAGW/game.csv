"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given its true worth to me, I would like to propose a price of $15000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both the value of the product and my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget concerns.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I am still unable to meet at $16500 due to my financial constraints. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product and our respective budgets.",15000.0,Bob,4,
