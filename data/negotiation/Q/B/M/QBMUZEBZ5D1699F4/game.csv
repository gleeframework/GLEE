"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you and my original asking price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
