"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept anything higher than that.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1000000, but I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."
