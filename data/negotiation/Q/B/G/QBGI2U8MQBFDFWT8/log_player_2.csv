"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my firm price point early on and leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still more than I can afford.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway and hopefully encourages Alice to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about we try $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push her further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 is still pushing it for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making one last push with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's last offer but still within a range I'm comfortable with. It shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I have a firm budget I need to stay within."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'll meet you at $11,000, and that's my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still outside my budget and I'm only two rounds away from having to make a decision.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, who is willing to sell for my maximum budget. It's better to walk away from this negotiation and secure a deal with John than to risk continuing and potentially ending up with a worse outcome."
