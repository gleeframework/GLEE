"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. ",1325000.0,Bob,4,
