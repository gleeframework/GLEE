"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's get this deal done! "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob would gain from buying the product.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help build rapport and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.  There's still room to try and close the deal at a higher price. 
* **Potential for Better Offer:**  Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, suggesting there's potential for him to increase his offer. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees a higher price, Alice might be able to get closer to her desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm making a counter offer that is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial counter. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiation position.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value the product holds for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of a fair deal.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I explicitly suggest seeking a compromise to encourage Bob to consider a higher offer.
* **Maintaining the Deal:** I'm still trying to close the deal with Bob, as a higher offer from John is always available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:**  $900,000 is still lower than Alice's desired price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, she has a higher guaranteed option.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Alice still has 6 rounds left.  She can try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob, or at least get closer to her desired price.
* **Risk of Losing John:**  While selling to John is always an option, Alice may feel she can still reach a deal with Bob that's closer to her preferred price. 

**Next Steps:**

Alice will make a counter offer to Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to her desired price. She will need to carefully balance the risk of losing Bob and the potential to gain more by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $950,000 to reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000.  This ensures both of us get a fair deal, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This is a common tactic in negotiations, showing flexibility and willingness to find a compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** While Alice is coming down from her previous offer, she's still holding on to a significant portion of the value she believes the product holds. 
* **Urgency and Finality:** Alice's message emphasizes the need to reach a deal and makes it seem like this might be her final offer. This could encourage Bob to accept.

**Rationale:**

Alice needs to weigh the potential of getting a slightly higher price from Bob against the risk of losing him.  Offering a middle ground price could be the best way to secure a deal while minimizing the potential for further negotiations that could drag on and potentially result in a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's wrap up this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** Bob's offer of $910,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Alice has 4 rounds left. There is still room for negotiation to potentially get closer to her desired price.
* **Risk of Losing John:** While selling to John is always an option, Alice may feel she can still reach a deal with Bob that's closer to her preferred price. 

**Next Steps:**

Alice will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to her desired price. She will need to carefully balance the risk of losing Bob and the potential to gain more by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle and settle on $915,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  Alice is only increasing her offer by a small amount, showing that she's willing to be flexible, but not drastically change her position. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This language suggests a compromise and that Alice is willing to meet Bob halfway, making it more appealing. 
* **Finality:** The message includes ""I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with,"" suggesting that Alice might be ready to close the deal if Bob doesn't agree.  

**Rationale:**

Alice is strategically trying to squeeze out a bit more from Bob while also making it clear that she's approaching the end of her negotiation flexibility. She's also setting the stage to potentially accept Bob's next offer if it's close to her counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $912,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Goal:** While $912,000 is closer to Alice's desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below her ideal outcome. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only two rounds left, Alice can still try to negotiate a slightly higher price, especially since she has a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's willingness to continue negotiating suggests that he might be open to a slight increase in his offer.

**Next Steps:**

Alice will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to her desired $915,000. She needs to balance the risk of losing Bob against the potential for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down just a bit further to $913,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finally close this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 913000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice is making a very small concession, signaling this might be her final offer. She's still holding on to a significant portion of her desired price. 
* **Urgency:** By saying ""Let's make it happen,"" Alice is creating a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to accept.
* **Value Proposition:**  Alice re-emphasizes the value of the product to make the offer more appealing to Bob.

**Rationale:**

With only one round left, Alice is trying to secure a deal that is closer to her desired price. She is taking a calculated risk by making a final offer, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further negotiations or the possibility of losing the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice will likely sell to John for $1,200,000 in the final round."
