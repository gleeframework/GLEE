"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's get this deal done!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. By rejecting, Bob can start negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $950,000 to reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000.  This ensures both of us get a fair deal, and we can move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still get the product for $800,000 from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price from Alice.  If he rejects, he can make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's wrap up this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle and settle on $915,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $915,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he still has options to potentially get a better deal.  There are 3 rounds remaining, and he can still potentially get closer to $910,000 or even lower. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price. If he rejects this offer, he can still make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his goal.  Additionally, if he's not happy with the outcome, he can always fall back to buying from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $912,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 912000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down just a bit further to $913,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finally close this deal.  Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $913,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $913,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob is running out of time and negotiation rounds.  While he would ideally prefer to get the product for $912,000 or even lower, Alice is only willing to go down to $913,000. It's better for Bob to accept this offer, as he only has one round left and he can't afford to risk not getting the product at all. 

Accepting the offer for $913,000 saves Bob $87,000 compared to buying from John, and it also saves him from potentially losing out on the product if he rejects Alice's offer and runs out of time."
