"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm comfortable offering $9,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,7,
