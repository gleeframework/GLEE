Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a worse deal. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs."
