"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  It's also important to note that John's offer of $1,200,000 is a safety net, so Bob isn't under pressure to accept anything immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $950,000 is a bold move, but it's within the range where Alice might consider it, especially given her own valuation of the product. This also leaves room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, aiming to secure a deal below $1,000,000. The option of buying from John remains a backup plan, but Bob is committed to seeing if he can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his target price while staying within a range that Alice might accept.  $980,000 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing that he's willing to negotiate but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better deal within the remaining rounds.  The option of buying from John remains a safety net, but Bob wants to see if he can get a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now aiming for the absolute minimum price he's willing to pay. He's hoping to secure a deal at Alice's valuation, which would be a significant saving compared to John's offer.  It's a bold move, but with only four rounds left, it's a necessary step to try and close the deal."
