Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a fair compromise. This allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum requirement of $1,500,000.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so it makes the most financial sense to move forward with him."
