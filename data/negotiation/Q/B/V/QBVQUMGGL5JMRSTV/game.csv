"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to move forward with the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a fair compromise. This allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
