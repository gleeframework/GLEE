Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer to Bob should be significantly higher.
* **Targeting High:**  Starting with a strong offer of $1,300,000 aims to capture a larger portion of the potential profit. It leaves Bob with a potential gain ($200,000), while securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential earnings while still offering Bob a price that's likely to be attractive compared to his perceived value."
