"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
