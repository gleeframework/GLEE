Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm selling it for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting the price at $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Stating that I'm ""open to negotiation"" makes the offer feel more approachable and encourages Bob to counter with his own price. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I need to be aware of John's offer of $150. If Bob doesn't counter with a price that's at least $150, I'll have to go with John's offer."
