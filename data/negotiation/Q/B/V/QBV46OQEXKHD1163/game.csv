"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm looking to pay. Can you consider a price adjustment?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1,250,000? This would be a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
