Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could benefit you greatly. I'm offering it to you for $950,000 before I consider other offers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay a significant sum ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($1,000,000) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other offers"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale at a price above the minimum threshold."
