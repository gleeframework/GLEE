"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the significant value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I'm unable to meet $850,000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
