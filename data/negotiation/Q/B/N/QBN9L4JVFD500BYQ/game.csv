"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now. I'm confident this product will be valuable to my business, and I'm prepared to offer you $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to come to an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
