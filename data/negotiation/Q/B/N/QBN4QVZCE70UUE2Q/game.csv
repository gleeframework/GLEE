"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
