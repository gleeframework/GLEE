"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  I think that's a fair price considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming lower. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. Offering $95 shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
