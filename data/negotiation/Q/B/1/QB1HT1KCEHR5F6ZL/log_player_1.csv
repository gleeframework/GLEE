Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Secure a Deal Quickly:** A slightly lower price than Bob's maximum valuation might encourage him to accept quickly, avoiding the need to go to John. 

This strategy aims to achieve a high sale price while considering the potential for negotiation and the guaranteed backup offer from John."
