"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and the ability to walk away to John, so there's room to improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to save a substantial amount of money. This initial offer is still below Alice's minimum price but is a starting point for negotiation. It shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my offer, but I'm still convinced I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can push her down further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still well below Alice's current offer.  I'm hoping this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  I'm also still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer. While I would ideally get it lower,  we are getting closer to a deal. Accepting her offer saves me $80,000 compared to buying from John. With fewer rounds left, it's not worth risking the deal by continuing to negotiate."
