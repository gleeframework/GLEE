"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary and leaves a good profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it leaves some room for us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal. While I could potentially squeeze a little more out of Bob, I don't want to risk him walking away completely."
