"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $77.50 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81.25?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $78 is a good price for the product. Can we go with that?",78.0,Bob,6,
