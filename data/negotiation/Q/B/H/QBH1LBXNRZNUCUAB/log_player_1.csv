"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. Although I am motivated to close the deal, $1,200,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,250,000. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a better deal, or at least test Bob's willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $1,350,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more offer: $1,300,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,300,000.  While this is still less than my ideal price, it's a good deal for me considering the following:

* I've already rejected several of Bob's offers and he is unlikely to go higher.
* Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but I'm taking a risk by delaying. There's no guarantee John will still be interested in buying if I continue negotiating with Bob.
* I only have 4 rounds left. 

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 secures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of losing a sale altogether."
