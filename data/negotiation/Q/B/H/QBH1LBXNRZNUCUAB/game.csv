"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $1,350,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,
