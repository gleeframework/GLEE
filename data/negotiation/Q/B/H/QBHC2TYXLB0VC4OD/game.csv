"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and your initial offer of $120.",95.0,Bob,4,
