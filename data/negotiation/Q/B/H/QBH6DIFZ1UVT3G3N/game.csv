"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $950,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $825,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. My revised offer is $825,000 is a bit too high, but I can go to $810,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the further compromise. To be honest, $810,000 is a tempting offer. However, I'm trying to stay closer to $780,000. If you're able to meet that, I think we have a deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that $810,000 is tempting for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to think about my minimum. My revised offer is $820,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close to my limit.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to $790,000.  This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but $790,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'll meet you at $815,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",815000.0,Alice,9,
