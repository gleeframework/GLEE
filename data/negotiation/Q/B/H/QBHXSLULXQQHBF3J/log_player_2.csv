"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,150,000 is still above your desired maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, and rejecting the first offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away.
* **Offer a price within your budget:**  $1,050,000 is still below your maximum of $1,200,000, but leaves room for some potential negotiation.
* **Keep the tone positive:** Maintain a friendly and professional tone to encourage a productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,050,000 is below its worth.  Would you consider $1,120,000?  I'm confident you'll find this offer reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,120,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** You've already shown Alice you're willing to walk away, and rejecting her offer again demonstrates your seriousness.  You have several rounds left to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,120,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing your offer but staying within your maximum budget.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** The message highlights the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, creating a sense of partnership.
* **Sign of urgency:** Stating that it's a serious offer suggests that you are ready to finalize the deal, putting a little pressure on Alice."
