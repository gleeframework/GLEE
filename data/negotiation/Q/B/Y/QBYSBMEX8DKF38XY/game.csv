"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still gives you a significant profit margin.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000.  This still leaves you a substantial profit, and it's a fair compromise given where we both stand. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
