"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
