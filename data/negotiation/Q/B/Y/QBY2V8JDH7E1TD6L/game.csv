"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 seems a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would that be possible?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $11,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $12,500, which is my best price. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your best price, and it's getting close to what I can afford.  How about we settle at $11,500? ",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying it, and I'm considering other options. I'd rather not sell it to you at a price that's lower than its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
