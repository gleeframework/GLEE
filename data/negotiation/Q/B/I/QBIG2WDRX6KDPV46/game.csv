"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Could you do $700,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $725,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
