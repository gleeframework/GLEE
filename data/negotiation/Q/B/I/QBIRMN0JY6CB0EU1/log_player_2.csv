"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth even more to you.  Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'm not sure if I should accept Alice's offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $14,000, which is less than the $15,000 that John is asking for. However, I'm not sure if Alice will make a counteroffer if I reject her initial offer. Let me think for a moment...
