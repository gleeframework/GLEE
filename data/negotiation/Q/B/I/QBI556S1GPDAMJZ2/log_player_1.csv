I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and a good deal considering the negotiation process.  It's also higher than what I would get from John."
