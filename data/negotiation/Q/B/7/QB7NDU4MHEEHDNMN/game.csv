"Hi Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, given the significant value this product brings, I believe it's worth a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but your offer significantly undervalues the product and its potential return on investment for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair deal considering the value it brings.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $800,000, which would be $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're reaching a difficult point.  While I value your interest, I have other potential buyers for this product. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000, but that's absolutely as low as I can go. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm still the most interested party. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and my budget constraints. If not, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
