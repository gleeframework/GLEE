"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I still think $1,325,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I'd like to emphasize that I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1.35 million to make this work.  How about $1,360,000?  This is my best offer.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $1,360,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
