# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. You should reject this offer and go with the better deal."
