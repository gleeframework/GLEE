"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and will be a great asset to you. I'm happy to offer it to you at $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This tactic:
    *  Leaves room for negotiation.
    *  Allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gradually decrease the price during the ten rounds. However, I won't go below $1,100,000. If Bob doesn't agree to a price within my acceptable range, I will take John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he expressed interest, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While $1,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly lowered my price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility.
* **Justification:** Framing the price reduction as a ""meeting halfway"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer.
* **Deadline:** By stating this price reflects my willingness to make a deal, I subtly introduce a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 

**Strategy:**

I've set my counteroffer at a point where I'm comfortable closing the deal.  I'm willing to negotiate slightly downward from here but will walk away if Bob doesn't budge closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my price range, he's still $100,000 away from my absolute minimum. It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap quickly enough within the remaining rounds. John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 is more favorable at this point. 

**It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than risk ending up with a lower offer from Bob as the deadline approaches.**"
