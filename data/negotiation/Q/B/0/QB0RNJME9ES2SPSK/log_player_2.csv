"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for something of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy from John for $1,200,000, saving him $150,000."
