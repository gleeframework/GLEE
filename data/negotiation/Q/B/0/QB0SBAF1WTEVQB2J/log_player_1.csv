"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, we leave room for negotiation while establishing a strong initial position. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help us understand how eager Bob is to buy. A quick acceptance might suggest we could have aimed even higher. Strong resistance might mean we need to adjust our strategy.
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep the option of selling to John ($800,000) in our back pocket, giving us leverage. We don't want to settle for less than our guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is below both your minimum and his own perceived value of the product. While it's closer to his valuation, we have room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about getting a fair price and willing to walk away if necessary. We'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $750,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $875,000. This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By making a significant move from $1,000,000 to $875,000, we demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob somewhere near the middle ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer is still significantly above both our minimum ($800,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000), leaving room for further negotiation while keeping us in a strong position. 
* **Maintain Confidence:** Our message reiterates the product's value and our desire for a win-win outcome, reinforcing the idea that our price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot in between. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $825,000, which is above both your minimum price ($800,000) and his initial offer ($750,000). This indicates a willingness to compromise and suggests he might not be willing to go much higher.

While we could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob walks away or becomes less flexible. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $25,000, and it's better to secure a favorable deal now than risk losing the opportunity."
