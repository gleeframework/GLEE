"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $750,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $875,000. This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot in between.",825000.0,Bob,4,
