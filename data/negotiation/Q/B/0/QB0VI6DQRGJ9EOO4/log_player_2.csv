"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice or exploring other options."
