{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both parties to make concessions and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding John Immediately:**  While John is willing to pay the full $15,000, it's beneficial to explore negotiation with Bob first. There's a chance that a deal can be struck with Bob, and potentially at a higher price than $12,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. It's crucial to monitor Bob's reaction and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, aiming to reach a compromise.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** While selling to John is tempting, I'm not desperate.  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always choose to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll consider his offer carefully and be prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Target:** I'm raising my offer slightly from $12,000 to $11,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't give up the product for a price significantly below my minimum.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm framing the $11,000 offer as a ""middle ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By rejecting his initial offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting a good price, but I'm also leaving the door open to further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** I'll closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate Further:** If he rejects it, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer, potentially moving slightly closer to his offer.
* **Remember the John Option:** If negotiations fail, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Need to Negotiate Further:**  I'm not comfortable selling at that price, and there is still room for negotiation. I can make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired price.
* **John is Still a Safe Backup:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000. This option keeps me from being pressured into accepting an offer I'm not comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll consider his offer carefully and be prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but still staying above my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a midpoint between our last two offers to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and create a more balanced negotiation.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While I'm showing willingness to compromise, I'm not settling for an offer that's significantly below my desired price. I'm confident in the value of the product and my ability to sell it to John if needed. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll closely watch how Bob reacts to this offer. His response will give me valuable information about his willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Be Prepared to Make Final Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to make one more counteroffer, potentially moving closer to his last offer but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Don't Hesitate to Sell to John:**  If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll confidently sell the product to John.  This guarantees I'll earn my minimum desired price, even if it means missing out on a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, so how about we try $10,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Line:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still $5,000 below that. 
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers might lead to a stalemate.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price. It's a more secure and reliable option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm always open to reaching a deal, I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John is the most sensible choice at this point, ensuring I receive the best possible outcome."
