Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $835000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that this price is fair, considering the value the product brings to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $10,000 more than your last counteroffer.  At this point, you're getting close to your target price, and continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away or you losing time and needing to buy from John.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's reasonably close to your target."
