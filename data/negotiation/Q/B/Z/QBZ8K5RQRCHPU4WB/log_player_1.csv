"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, we set a high anchor in Bob's mind.  Even if this offer is rejected, it makes subsequent offers in the $1,500,000 - $2,000,000 range seem more reasonable.
* **Understanding Bob's Position:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Our high initial offer gives us space to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation.

This strategy leaves us ample room to adjust our price in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000).  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. We are confident that we can negotiate a better deal, so we will reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your feedback on my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While we rejected Bob's low offer, we are showing flexibility by making a significant price reduction from our initial offer of $2,200,000. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Our new offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.  
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** By positioning our price at $1,900,000, we hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to the $1,500,000 mark.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  While I believe the product is valuable, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now very close to our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, the difference is relatively small at this point. 

* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the negotiation in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further has a cost. Accepting now allows us to move forward with the sale.

Overall, accepting $1,450,000 is a pragmatic choice that secures a favorable outcome."
