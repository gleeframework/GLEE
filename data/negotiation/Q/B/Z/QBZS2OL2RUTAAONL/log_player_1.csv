Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (the minimum you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Value (your backup):** $1,500,000

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price.  This means you don't have to settle for less than $1,500,000.  However, there's an opportunity to try and get more from Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. It's something I value highly, but I believe it could be of significant benefit to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,650,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire [mention a key benefit or two of the product]."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,650,000 aims to anchor the negotiation higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:** Highlight the key benefits of the product for Bob, emphasizing its potential value beyond his initial assessment.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While you have a strong alternative, leaving some room for negotiation can make Bob feel more engaged in the process.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't budge or offers significantly less than $1,500,000, you're better off selling to John.
* **Be Confident and Professional:** Your communication style can significantly impact the outcome. 

Remember, negotiation is about finding a mutually agreeable outcome. Good luck!"
