"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering the value you'll get out of it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than $10,000 from John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He clearly values the product at $12,000, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's still a great price for you, considering the value you'll gain. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to move a little higher, how about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is a better offer than $10,000 from John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe Bob has some room to move as he clearly values the product at $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, let's meet in the middle at $10,875. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
