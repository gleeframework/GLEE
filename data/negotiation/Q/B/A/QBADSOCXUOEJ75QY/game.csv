"Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product seems interesting, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $10,000. This is a good price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again to get a deal done.",10500.0,Alice,5,
