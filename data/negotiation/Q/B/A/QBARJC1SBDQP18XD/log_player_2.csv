"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is lower than the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $850,000 is still a bit below the value I was expecting. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his maximum budget of $800,000.  Accepting the offer at this point saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile deal.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice walking away or the negotiations taking too long.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
