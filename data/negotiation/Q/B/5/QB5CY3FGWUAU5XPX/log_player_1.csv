Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product I think you'll really like for $95. I'm confident it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a small discount, making it more enticing for him to accept, while also maximizing your potential profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed $80 from John."
