"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. How about we try $1,180,000? It's a compromise, but it's still a good deal for you.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,180,000 is still too much for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,140,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and avoids further back and forth.",1140000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,160,000? It's a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
