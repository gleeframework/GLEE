"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You're aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but still a bit higher. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get the price down further. You're still within your budget, and have time to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. How about we try $1,180,000? It's a compromise, but it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $1,180,000 is still too high. There are still rounds left, and you have the option of buying from John for a lower price. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,180,000 is still too much for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,140,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and avoids further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 1140000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,160,000? It's a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out for a higher price than you're comfortable with. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and are approaching the halfway point. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal increases. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price point."
