Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
