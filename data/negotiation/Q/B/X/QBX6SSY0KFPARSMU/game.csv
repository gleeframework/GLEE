"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $14,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
