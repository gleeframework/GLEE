"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $10500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer of $11000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500, as I mentioned earlier. But I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $11800? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer of $11200. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $11500? If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
