"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My initial offer is $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is starting at her highest price, her product's full value to her. There's no reason for me to accept this initial offer. I should counter with a lower price to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:** I've started with a significant counteroffer, aiming to bring the price closer to a range where I'd be happy to make a deal. This leaves room for further negotiation while still expressing strong interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $100,000 is still a significant difference. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:** I'm splitting the difference here. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a competitive price. It's getting close to the point where I might accept to avoid the risk of losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1,080,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to get the best price, but this offer is getting close enough to my initial target.  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a small additional discount, and there's a risk Alice could become less willing to deal. It's better to secure a good price now than risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's full price."
