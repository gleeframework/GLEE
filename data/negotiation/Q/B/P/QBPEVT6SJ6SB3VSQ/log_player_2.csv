"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below our maximum budget to give us room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message expresses interest while being firm about the price being a major factor.  

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $13,000 is closer, but still significantly above your $8,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move her price down suggests there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but only slightly, to show Alice we're willing to move but also holding firm to our budget constraints.
* **Setting a Limit:**  By stating ""$7,000 is the most I can do,"" we're sending a clear signal about our upper limit (even though we might go slightly higher if absolutely necessary). 

It's a delicate balance between moving towards a deal and not overpaying!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to try to pressure you into accepting. However, we still have rounds to go and John's offer as a backup.
* **Still Above Budget:** $11,000 is better, but still significantly over your target price.
* **Opportunity for Counter:** By rejecting, we can try one more time to get closer to our desired range before considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $11,000 is just not feasible for me.  I can do $7,500 as an absolute maximum. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, although I'd prefer to work something out with you."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Respectful:**  We acknowledge Alice's ""final offer"" but stand firm on our budget limitations. 
* **Slight Increase:** A small increase from $7,000 to $7,500 shows flexibility while remaining under our $8,000 limit.
* **Alternative Option:** Introducing the possibility of John's offer adds a touch of pressure without being overly aggressive.

This is a crucial point in the negotiation.  Let's see how Alice responds!"
