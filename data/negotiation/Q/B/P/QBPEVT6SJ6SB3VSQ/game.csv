"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $11,000 is just not feasible for me.  I can do $7,500 as an absolute maximum. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, although I'd prefer to work something out with you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
