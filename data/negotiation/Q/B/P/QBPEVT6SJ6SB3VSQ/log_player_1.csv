Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $11,000 is just not feasible for me.  I can do $7,500 as an absolute maximum. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, although I'd prefer to work something out with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price point that makes sense for me.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
