Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to get a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and give you an idea of his negotiation style. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, the phrasing ""significant value"" hints at the product being worth more than Bob might initially think.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial offer. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your minimum of $10,000."
