Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a fair price point. It's higher than my minimum value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the counteroffer! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about $90?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in getting this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price point. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a much better deal. It's also significantly higher than selling to John, so accepting this offer is the best option."
