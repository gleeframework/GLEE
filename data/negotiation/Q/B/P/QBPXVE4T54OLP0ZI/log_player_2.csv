Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not quite comfortable with $88, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $90. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $90 is a decent price compared to John's $120. It's time to accept the offer."
