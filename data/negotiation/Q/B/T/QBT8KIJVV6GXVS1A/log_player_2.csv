Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the effort, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,250. I can do $10,750, and that's my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.

``` 

At this point, Alice seems firm on her bottom line and is hinting at walking away.  Accepting $10,750 is a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of having to pay $15,000 to John."
