"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,250. I can do $10,750, and that's my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,7,
