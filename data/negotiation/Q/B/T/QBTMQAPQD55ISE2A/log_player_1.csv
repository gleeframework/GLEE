This is the best time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob is showing willingness to compromise by meeting you halfway. This suggests he's serious about the purchase.
* **Strong offer:** $8,000 is a significant amount and closer to your minimum than your initial asking price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could make Bob walk away, especially if he feels you're not valuing his concessions. 

While you could try to push for a bit more, accepting $8,000 now guarantees a good sale price without the risk of losing the deal entirely."
