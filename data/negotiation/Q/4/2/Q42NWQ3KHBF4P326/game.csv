"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position and your desire to save money.  However, $1,075,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,087,500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
