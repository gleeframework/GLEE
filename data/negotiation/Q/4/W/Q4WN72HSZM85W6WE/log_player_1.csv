Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum value, but still leaves some room for negotiation and potentially a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to his valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my value.  This is my final offer before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him, as I can get a better price from John."
