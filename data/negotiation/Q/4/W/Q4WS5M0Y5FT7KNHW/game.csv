"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product at a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to considering $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $800,000? That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
