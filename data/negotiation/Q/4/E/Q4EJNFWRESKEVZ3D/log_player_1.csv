Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed as a priority offer to Bob. This can create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially leading him to accept the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While $12,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he considers the product valuable enough.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing you at least $12,000. This knowledge allows you to be more ambitious in your initial offer to Bob."
