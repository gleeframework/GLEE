"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There is a potential for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This would still be a significant profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This would still be a substantial profit for you, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob can potentially try to negotiate further, Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than the price from John, and it's still a decent profit for Alice. There's a risk that if Bob rejects and makes another counteroffer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate, or even decide to stop negotiating altogether. In this scenario, Bob might end up having to buy the product from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option in this situation."
