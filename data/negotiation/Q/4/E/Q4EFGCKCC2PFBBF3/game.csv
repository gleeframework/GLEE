This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, I'm working within a specific budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $825,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and propose $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
