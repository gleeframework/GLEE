Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $1,500,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John),  there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  Offering it slightly below our reserve price creates a strong incentive for him to buy. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency, making Bob more likely to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price and ensuring we don't lose the opportunity to sell to John at our minimum acceptable price."
