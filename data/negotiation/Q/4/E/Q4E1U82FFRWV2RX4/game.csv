"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value this product holds for you.  Let's make this happen.",14250.0,Alice,5,
