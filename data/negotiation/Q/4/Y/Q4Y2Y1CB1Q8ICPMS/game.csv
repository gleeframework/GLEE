"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think!",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $6000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000?  I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8000. How about we try $7500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we settle on $7750? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",7750.0,Alice,5,
