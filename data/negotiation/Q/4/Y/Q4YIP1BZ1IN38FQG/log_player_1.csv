Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's potential to earn more than your fallback offer from John ($800,000).
* **Strong Starting Point:** $925,000 is a significant markup from your minimum but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $75,000).
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While this is a strong initial offer, it allows space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds it too high. You can then potentially still settle above your $800,000 guarantee from John.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and exclusivity, making Bob feel like he's part of a special opportunity."
