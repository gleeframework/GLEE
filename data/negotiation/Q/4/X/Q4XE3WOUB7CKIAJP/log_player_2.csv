"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate towards a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for the product."",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states that the initial offer is unacceptable and provides a concrete counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to bring Alice closer to my desired price range while leaving me the option to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $170.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still significantly higher than both your budget and what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice, but $170 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you meet me halfway at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):**  This counteroffer suggests a price that is closer to the middle ground between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant price reduction.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $110 keeps the negotiation alive and allows room for further compromise. It also keeps me below my maximum budget while still potentially securing a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $140?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $140 is her final offer. This means further negotiation with her is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay.
* **Budget Limit:**  $140 is still significantly higher than my $80 budget. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which aligns perfectly with my budget. 

It makes the most financial sense to end negotiations with Alice and purchase the product from John at my desired price point."
