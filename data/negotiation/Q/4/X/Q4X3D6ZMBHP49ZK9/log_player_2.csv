"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be a great addition to your collection, valued at $10,000 by you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within his budget, he can potentially get the product for less. By rejecting the offer, Bob can negotiate and aim for a price closer to his $10,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
