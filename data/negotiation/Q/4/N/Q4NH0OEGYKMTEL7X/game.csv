"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $1200000? I believe this would still allow us to both benefit from the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I appreciate your efforts in trying to find common ground. However, based on my budgetary constraints, I must respectfully decline your latest offer at $1300000. I would like to propose one last time at $1275000. I hope this final offer will be acceptable.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
