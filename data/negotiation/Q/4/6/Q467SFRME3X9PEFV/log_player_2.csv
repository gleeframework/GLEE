"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I would get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than what the product is worth to her, it's still more than you want to spend. You know John will sell you the product for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $1,500."
