Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had from others, I'm proposing a price of $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to sell it for even more to Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $12,000 or more is unlikely to entice Bob. A price closer to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) increases the chance of a sale, but leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $10,000 represents a compromise. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, potentially leading to a higher profit margin than selling to John.  It also provides a  strong incentive for Bob to buy now rather than risk losing the opportunity."
