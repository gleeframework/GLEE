"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, and I'm offering the product for $10,800. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,650? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",10650.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,650 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
