Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** $11,000 is more than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $11,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you're not losing money.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** It's a starting point for a negotiation, and allows Bob to counteroffer while still giving you a chance to make a profit. 

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response, and always have the option to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
