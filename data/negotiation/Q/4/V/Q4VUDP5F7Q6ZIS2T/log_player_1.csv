Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 would be a more realistic starting point for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While the product is unique, $1,200,000 is still a big stretch for me. Could we meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $750,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
