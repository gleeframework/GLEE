"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's something you're interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
