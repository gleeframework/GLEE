{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $105 is a bit too low for me, though. How about $110?  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get at least that much for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's meet in the middle at $108. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $108 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation, as it guarantees a profit and avoids potentially going through more rounds of negotiation."
