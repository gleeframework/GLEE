"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's a great investment for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I think we can find a middle ground. How does $135 sound? It's a bit higher than your offer but still quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $135 is closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
