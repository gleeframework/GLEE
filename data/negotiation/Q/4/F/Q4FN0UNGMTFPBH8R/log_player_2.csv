"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's more beneficial for Bob to reject the offer and buy from John at the lower price of $1,000,000."
