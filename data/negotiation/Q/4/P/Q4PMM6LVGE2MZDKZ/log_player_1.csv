Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's not worth the risk of him stalling the negotiation further. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
