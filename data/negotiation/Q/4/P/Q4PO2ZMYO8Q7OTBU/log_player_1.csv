"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob if the product is valuable to him.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can  push him to offer a higher price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000.  This is a compromise, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects this, I'll need to reconsider my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is still less than my initial asking price, it's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to close the deal.  There's always the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me, but  it's not worth risking the remaining rounds.  $11,000 is a good profit, and I'm happy with that."
