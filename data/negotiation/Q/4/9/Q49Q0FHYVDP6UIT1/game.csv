"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while still leaving me with a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the market value and potential profit I can generate.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about $850,000? This price gives you a solid profit margin, while still allowing me to cover my costs.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer at $750,000?  That price would allow me to make a fair profit while still ensuring you get a good return on your investment.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. This product is worth a lot more than that. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable outcome for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
