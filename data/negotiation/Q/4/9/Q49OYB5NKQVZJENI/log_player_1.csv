Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle for a price closer to $1,100,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,175,000? I'm eager to make this deal work and believe this offer strikes a good balance for both of us.
