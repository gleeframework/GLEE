"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle for a price closer to $1,100,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value and your potential gains, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still provides a substantial profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,175,000? I'm eager to make this deal work and believe this offer strikes a good balance for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 remains below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's bridge the gap to $1,225,000.  This compromise allows you to secure the product at a very competitive rate while ensuring I receive a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal now.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
