"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. It's a great opportunity to own this unique product, and I think it's worth every penny.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1400000. It's still a great price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
