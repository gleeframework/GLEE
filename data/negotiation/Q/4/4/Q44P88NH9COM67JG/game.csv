"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $95 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $105? It's a small compromise that still reflects the value of this product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
