"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product looks great, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Could we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
