"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your offer! I really appreciate you coming down in price. However, $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. That's the absolute maximum I can do. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to purchase the product. ",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 is a tough limit for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
