Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my research, I believe a fair starting point for this product would be $1,200,000.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm open to discussing further adjustments to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
