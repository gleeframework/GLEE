"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget for it is capped at $800000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's start at $800000 and see if we can bridge the gap.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping to get closer to my initial price of $1200000. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000, which is the price John is willing to pay. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'm willing to go as low as $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1050000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to $800000. Let's meet in the middle at $900000 and see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $900000, which is $975000. This is my final offer for now. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900000. I believe this price is fair, and I'm confident that it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can come to a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been patient and flexible, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $950000. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities. This is my last offer before I consider other buyers.",950000.0,Alice,7,
