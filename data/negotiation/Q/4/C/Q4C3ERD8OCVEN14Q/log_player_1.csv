It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $875,000 is a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeated his offer, indicating he's firm on this price.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing a good deal and potentially running out of rounds. 

While we could push for more, accepting now secures a strong profit."
