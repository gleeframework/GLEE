Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $15,000, hoping to maximize my potential profit. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and compromise.  I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
