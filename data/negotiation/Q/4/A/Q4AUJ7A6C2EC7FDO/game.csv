"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but I'm still not quite there.  My budget really does cap out at $15000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to purchase. Let me know your decision.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $15000 is your absolute maximum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,5,
