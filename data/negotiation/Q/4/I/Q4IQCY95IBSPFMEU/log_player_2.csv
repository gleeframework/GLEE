You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. $15,000 is above your budget, and you can always buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it still gives her some room to negotiate. I'm hoping this will kick off a good bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is at my budget limit, and it's the same as what I can get from John. No need to risk further negotiation."
