I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering $12,000, which is still a good profit for me. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it encourages him to come up in price."
