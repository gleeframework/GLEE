"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  While I'm getting closer to a price we can both agree on, $11500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12250?  This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $12000, my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
