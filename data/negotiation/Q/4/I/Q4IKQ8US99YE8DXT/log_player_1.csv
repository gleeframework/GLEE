"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Openness:**  Stating I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the process.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning that the product is ""fantastic"" subtly implies its worth without explicitly stating it. 

This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob shows interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a sale, but it's likely I can do better with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  This counter-offer is a compromise, but still above my minimum threshold.
* **Justification:** I explain the price reduction and emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make another counter-offer, trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  While I'm getting closer to a price we can both agree on, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one.
* **Fairness:** I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price, suggesting it benefits both parties.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in closing the deal encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's close to my minimum and potentially a good deal for both of us. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I need to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  I believe there's still a chance Bob might increase his offer, especially since he's been willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:** I will make another counter-offer, aiming to find a middle ground that's closer to my desired price while also considering the limited number of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, setting a firm price at my minimum threshold. 
* **Urgency:** The message subtly conveys urgency by mentioning ""closing the deal"" and suggesting the negotiation is nearing an end.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate the price is ""fair"" and beneficial for both sides. 

**Next Steps:** I hope Bob will accept this final offer. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John for $12,000 to avoid losing any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $11900, and that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to our last two rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Losing Time:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to another rejection and potentially force me to sell to John at a lower price in the final round. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum price. While I prefer to earn more, it's a better strategy than risking another rejection from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'm accepting John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
