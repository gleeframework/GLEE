{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and also keeps the deal potentially attractive to me. I can always lower the price if Bob rejects the offer. If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer, but I'll keep the price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps this deal attractive. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Would you be open to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to sell yet, and I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and it's clear he's not willing to meet me halfway.  I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to continue wasting time.  I'll sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
