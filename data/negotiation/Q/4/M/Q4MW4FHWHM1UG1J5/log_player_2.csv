"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value of this product to me, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $12,000? That's a fair price that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you seem to recognize the value in this product.  Let's close the gap. How about $14,500, my final offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. He has already made a counteroffer and is now facing Alice's ""final offer."" While negotiating further is an option, it's not guaranteed to yield a better price. Given the risk of further negotiations failing, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
