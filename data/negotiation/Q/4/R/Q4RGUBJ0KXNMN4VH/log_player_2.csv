"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it could be extremely beneficial for your endeavors.  I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth. However, I understand this is a significant investment, so please consider carefully. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to purchase it immediately. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
