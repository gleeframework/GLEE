"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full $999000. Can we meet in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $925000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you at my previous offer of $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. Can you accept this offer?",850000.0,Bob,6,
