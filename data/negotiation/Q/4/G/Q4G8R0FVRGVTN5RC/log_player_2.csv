Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $10,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $9,500? This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems pretty firm on a price above $9,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll go down to a price that beats John's offer of $8,000. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John to ensure we get the best deal."
