"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $10,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $9,500? This is the best I can do.",9500.0,Alice,5,
