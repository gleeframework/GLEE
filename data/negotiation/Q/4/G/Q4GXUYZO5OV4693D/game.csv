"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit of a lower price point.  How about $750,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. While $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise further. I propose a price of $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
