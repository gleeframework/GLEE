I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
