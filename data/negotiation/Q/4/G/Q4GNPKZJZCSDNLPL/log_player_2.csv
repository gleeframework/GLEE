"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so any price higher than that is not in his best interest.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8500 is your maximum, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9750. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $9,750 is still too high for Bob, and he's already indicated that he's not willing to go higher than $8,500.  It's unlikely Alice will drop her price to $8,500, so Bob is better off going with John's offer."
