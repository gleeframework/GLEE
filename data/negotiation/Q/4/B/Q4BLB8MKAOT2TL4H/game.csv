"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product,  a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which I believe is a fair offer considering the value of the product to me.  I'm hopeful we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
