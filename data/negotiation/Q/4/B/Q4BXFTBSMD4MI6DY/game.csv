"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this quickly. What do you say?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
