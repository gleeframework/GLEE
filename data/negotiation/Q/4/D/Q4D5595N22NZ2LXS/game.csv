"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize the deal. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite high.  I'd be willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my target price. I'm prepared to offer $1,750,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
