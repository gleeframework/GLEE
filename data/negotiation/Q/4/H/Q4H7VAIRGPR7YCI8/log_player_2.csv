"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is $115. This is a decent price, but you can potentially do better by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110. This is a reasonable starting point that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aims to save some money. I'm hopeful Alice will accept this offer, as it's still above her value of $100."
