"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $100 and leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's also fair, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $110 is still a good deal for me, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's also a more certain outcome than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or even having to sell to John for $100."
