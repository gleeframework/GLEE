"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can potentially get it for less than $120, which would be a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $130? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $130 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $135? That way we both get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's still possible to get a better deal with Alice.  $135 is closer to your goal, but you can likely still negotiate it down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $132? It's just a little closer to what I'm looking for, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you - you're trying to get the best price. But $132 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $133? It's just a dollar more, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still closer to your goal price of $120. While $133 is tempting, you can probably get it down just a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're close. I'm willing to go up to $131, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 131}
