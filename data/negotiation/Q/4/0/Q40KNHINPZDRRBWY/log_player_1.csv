"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $130? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to sell the product,  $130 is still below my minimum price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $130 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $135? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $132? It's just a little closer to what I'm looking for, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I want to see if I can get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you - you're trying to get the best price. But $132 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $133? It's just a dollar more, but I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 133}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're close. I'm willing to go up to $131, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. Bob's offer of $131 is still below my minimum price, and we've been going back and forth for a few rounds. I'm not confident we'll be able to close the deal at a price I'm happy with. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
