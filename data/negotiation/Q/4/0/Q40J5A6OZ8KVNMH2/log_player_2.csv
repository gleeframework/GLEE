(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $90? Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about $85? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $85 is closer to your budget, you're still negotiating and have a backup option at $80. There's room to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to go up to $78, which is a fair offer considering your original price and my limit.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $85. Would you consider $82? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $82 offer.  At this point, cutting your losses and taking John's offer of $80 makes the most sense. You're running out of rounds, and further negotiation with Alice might not yield a better price."
