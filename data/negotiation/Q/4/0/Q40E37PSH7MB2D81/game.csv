"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to my desired outcome, it's still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
