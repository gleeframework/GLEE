"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $150,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to pay John's price."
