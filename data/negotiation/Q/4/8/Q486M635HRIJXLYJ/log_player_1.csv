Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a deal at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (our guaranteed price from John), there's a chance Bob would accept a slightly lower price, netting us a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything. We can confidently sell to John at our desired price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while securing a guaranteed sale with John."
