Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum ($8,000), leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000). 
* **Message:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps set a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This approach balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting closer to Bob's maximum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by counter-offering and seeing if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is tempting, it's still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my earnings. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly, reinforcing the idea that I'm willing to negotiate for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my desired price point, and it's significantly higher than the $8,000 I would get from John. Accepting this offer seems like the best strategy to maximize my earnings in this situation."
