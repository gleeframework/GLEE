"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $5,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's fair to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a little steep for me. Could we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $8,500? That's a good compromise, and it's a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
