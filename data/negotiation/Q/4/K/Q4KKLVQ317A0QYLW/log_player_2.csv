"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, that price is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Significant Difference:**  By offering $60 against Alice's $150, we signal that we're serious but need a much better price.
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, our goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to John's $80 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While $100 is better than $150, it's still significantly more than our $80 fallback option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so there's potential to bring the price down further. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  We need to counter in a way that encourages Alice to move closer to a price we'd accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but not completely caving to her $100 offer. Our $75 proposal aims to find a middle ground.
* **Sense of Urgency (Slightly):** By suggesting a ""fair compromise,"" we subtly imply that if this doesn't work, we might consider John's offer more seriously.
* **Below Target, Above John:** This offer keeps us under our $80 limit while still leaving some room for Alice to potentially counter if she's really motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $75, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice is unlikely to move much further down from $90. She's holding firm around this price point.
* **John's Price is Better:**  We have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. There's no point in paying more with Alice if we don't have to.
* **Time Cost:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort. The potential savings from Alice are now outweighed by the convenience of John's offer."
