"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer starts by aggressively trying to get closer to Alice's desired price of $1,200,000 while still leaving room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it gives Bob a good deal.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to pay John's price is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and without unnecessary risk."
