"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is bluffing. She wouldn't sell the product to John for less than she's offering it to you. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to get a better price from her or you can buy from John for $12,000."
