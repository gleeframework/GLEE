"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he has some room to meet me in the middle.  I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting it. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise from my first offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for me to get a good price. I believe that Bob is likely to accept this offer as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now close to my minimum price.  Accepting it ensures I get a good price,  and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing and forcing me to sell to John at a lower price."
