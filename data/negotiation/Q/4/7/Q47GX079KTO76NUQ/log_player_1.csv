{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This creates room for negotiation while still ensuring a good return for me. I'm also phrasing the message in a friendly and positive manner to encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only able to go as high as $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to go with the $750,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which still leaves some room for profit for you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold. I'm also emphasizing the potential profit for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can avoid any further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell for more, it's the best offer I've received so far. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a sale without further negotiation, minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
