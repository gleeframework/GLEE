"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my maximum",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $165. It's a small increase from your maximum, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality and value.",165.0,Alice,5,
