{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,237,500.  While this is slightly below my preferred price, it's a reasonable offer considering the limited rounds left.  It's important to weigh the potential of getting a slightly higher price in the next round against the risk of not closing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower amount.  I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision in this scenario."
