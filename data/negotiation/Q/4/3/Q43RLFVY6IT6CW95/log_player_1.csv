Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's still too low. I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be at least $10,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and is a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and there's no guarantee that I could get a better price in the remaining rounds."
