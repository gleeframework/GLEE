Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic markup:** The offer of $1,450,000 represents a  20.8% increase over your minimum acceptable price. This markup aims to capitalize on the product's equal value to Bob while acknowledging there might be some back and forth. 
* **Open to discussion:** The message is framed positively and invites Bob's feedback, leaving the door open for negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), you might adjust your approach accordingly.
* **Market conditions:**  While not specified, factors like market demand for similar products could influence your pricing strategy."
