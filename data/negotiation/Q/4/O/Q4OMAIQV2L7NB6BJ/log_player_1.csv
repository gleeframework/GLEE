"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I can still try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, which would be $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original asking price,  $87.50 is a good compromise and a decent profit for me. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
