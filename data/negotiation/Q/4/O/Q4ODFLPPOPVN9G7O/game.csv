"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $115 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $120? This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",120.0,Alice,5,
