{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?

Round 5

Alice is back to her original offer of $9,000.  This is a good deal for you, as it's still cheaper than buying from John and closer to your desired price. Accepting the offer secures the product and saves you some money."
