{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** This price allows for a potential compromise in the negotiation, ensuring a fair price for both of us.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I am aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. This offer gives Bob a chance to make a deal before I go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. While Bob is pushing for a lower price, he's expressed interest in the product, suggesting a deal is possible. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm not desperate. Knowing that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000? This is a substantial discount from my original offer and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not too much:**  I'm offering a significant discount from my initial price, showing flexibility. However, $11,000 is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Building towards a deal:**  This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $10,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from Bob in the next round. He's already stated his maximum. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:** If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **John is a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a desperate situation.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,500. It's a fair price, and I'm happy to have secured a sale."
