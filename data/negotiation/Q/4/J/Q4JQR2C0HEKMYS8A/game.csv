"Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,100,000? This allows for some negotiation space while still respecting the product's worth.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,350,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
