{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum price point of $120. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** There's a gap between Alice's value ($80) and your value ($120), so you can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.**  It's important to remember you have a guaranteed alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value ($80). It shows you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  It's unlikely Alice will accept this price immediately, but it sets the stage for further negotiation and gives you room to make concessions in later rounds.
* **Staying below your limit:**  This offer is well within your budget of $120."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You have room to negotiate further.** There's still a gap between your maximum price and Alice's desired price.
* **You have a backup option.** You can still buy from John if negotiations fail.  

Since there are more rounds available, it's better to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

* **Staying within your budget:**  It's still comfortably below your $120 limit.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your last offer ($90) and Alice's latest offer ($105).  It shows a willingness to compromise and signals that you're serious about reaching a deal.
* **Staying within your budget:**  It's still within your $120 limit, giving you some breathing room.
* **Increasing pressure:**  By offering a price closer to her own, you're putting some pressure on Alice to accept. 

If Alice rejects this offer, you might need to reconsider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with her or if it's time to go to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You have a good chance to get a better deal.**  You've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and Alice is showing some flexibility. There's a good chance you can get her to come down further.
* **John is your safety net.** If negotiations fall apart, you still have the option to buy from John.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between Alice's latest offer ($110) and your last offer ($95). It shows a willingness to compromise and signals a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** With only three rounds remaining, it's a calculated risk. If Alice accepts, you get a good deal. If she rejects, you can still go to John. 
* **Pressure tactic:** It puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision. She knows that if she rejects this offer, she may lose you as a buyer and be forced to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although her offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above your comfort zone and leaves very little room for negotiation in the final round. 
* **You have one round left.** This is a critical moment. It's worth pushing for a lower price, but you need to balance that with the risk of losing the deal.
* **John is your backup plan.** You can always go to John if negotiations fail.

This is a risky move, but with only one round remaining, it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice.  If her final offer is unacceptable, you can always fall back on John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is your last chance to get a better price from Alice. Offering $105 is a compromise, acknowledging that she needs to make some profit, but also pushing for a fair deal for yourself.
* **Balanced risk:** It's a gamble.  Alice might reject it, forcing you to buy from John. But it's a reasonable offer, and there's a chance she might accept it, saving you some money.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  If she rejects, you'll have to buy from John, but at least you'll have tried to get the best possible price from Alice.

This final offer reflects the calculated risk you're taking to try to secure a lower price."
