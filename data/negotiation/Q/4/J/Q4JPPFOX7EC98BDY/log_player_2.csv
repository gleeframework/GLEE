# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

Alice has reached her minimum price.  Continuing to negotiate likely won't yield a better price and there's a risk Alice walks away. Accepting $800,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000."
