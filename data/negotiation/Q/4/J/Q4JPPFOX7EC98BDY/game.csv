"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
