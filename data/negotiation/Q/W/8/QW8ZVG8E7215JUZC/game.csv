"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which reflects the significant value you'll gain. Let's talk!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than what you mentioned.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the significant value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's find common ground and close this deal!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value our partnership,  $875,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. Let's compromise at $890,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",880000.0,Bob,6,
