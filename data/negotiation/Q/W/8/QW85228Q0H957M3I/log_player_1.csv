{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for several counteroffers from Bob before I have to consider selling to John. 

This strategy balances the need to earn as much as possible with the risk of losing the sale to John if the negotiation drags on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not desperate for a sale and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. It's worth risking a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a higher price.  I'll use the information from Bob's counteroffer to refine my strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work. This is a significant discount for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the ""discount"" for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Finality:** I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to seriously consider it.

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while maintaining my goal of maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that's too low.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and see if I can push him further. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of back and forth, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I understand $9,500 is still within your budget, it's simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price is fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's position and show appreciation for his continued negotiation. 
* **Firm but fair:** I make it clear that $10,000 is my final compromise, implying that I'm unlikely to go lower.
* **Positive framing:** I focus on the benefits for Bob, emphasizing a ""smooth transaction.""
* **Urgency:** I subtly hint at the potential risk of losing the sale by suggesting a quick decision.

This counteroffer aims to secure a price closer to my desired range while still maintaining a good relationship with Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I've been willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where it's no longer financially viable for me to continue with Bob.

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price, it makes sense to sell the product to John. This ensures a more profitable outcome and avoids the potential for further negotiation with Bob, which may ultimately lead to a lower sale price."
