"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value to me and the price you're asking. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
