"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's potential warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a fair balance between its value and my initial investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
