"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While $900,000 is lower than the price from John, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.**  There is significant room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and Alice at $800,000.
* **Rounds are limited.**  Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  To kick things off, how about we try $850,000?  I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's value and potential."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for further compromise.** Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 showed a willingness to compromise. Alice's response indicates a desire to reach a deal. 
* **Rounds remaining.**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is closer, but let's aim for a final price that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the potential for future collaboration.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 860000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price takes into account the product's value and potential, while also being reasonable for both parties. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price.**  $870,000 is only $10,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. 
* **Time is running out.**  With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Potential for future deals.**  Accepting the offer shows good faith and could lead to future opportunities for collaboration with Alice."
