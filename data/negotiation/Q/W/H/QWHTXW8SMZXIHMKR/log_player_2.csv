You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than he's willing to pay. He should counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints. Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can still likely get a better price.  He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
