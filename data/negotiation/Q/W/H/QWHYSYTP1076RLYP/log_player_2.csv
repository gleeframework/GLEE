"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to get the product for $80 or less. Alice's initial offer is far too high.  Rejecting the offer lets you start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but $120 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than $120, it's still above your target of $80.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm very serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about getting the product, Bob! However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to your desired price, you're still $15 over your target. You have rounds left, so rejecting the offer lets you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you've made concessions, but I'm still not quite there.  $95 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $92.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $95, but I'm not budging below that. I'm confident you'll love the product, and I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much further and you're running out of rounds. You're close to your target price, but it's not worth risking missing out on the product altogether. It's better to go with John's offer of $80."
