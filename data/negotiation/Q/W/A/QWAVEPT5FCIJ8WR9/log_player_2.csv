"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing the lower price."
