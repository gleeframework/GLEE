"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,200 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,850?",8850.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,850, which would be $9,025. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",9025.0,Alice,5,
