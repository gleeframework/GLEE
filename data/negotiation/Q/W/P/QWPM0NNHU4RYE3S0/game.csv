"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $10,900 for this product. That's my final offer.  I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.",10900.0,Alice,5,
