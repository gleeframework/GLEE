"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,000, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While we've made some progress, it seems like further negotiation might be too time-consuming and unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product from John at my target price and avoid further negotiation."
