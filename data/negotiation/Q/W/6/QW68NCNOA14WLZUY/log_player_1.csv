Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I'll reject and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $8,200.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our positions.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,200. Would you be willing to consider $7,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $7,900 is still too low for me, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I have a few rounds left to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for anything less than my minimum value yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is my final offer.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8000}
