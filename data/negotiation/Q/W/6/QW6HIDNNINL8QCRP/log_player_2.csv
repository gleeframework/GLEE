"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good deal, but you can potentially save even more by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price to $95, which is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. It's also a fair compromise, considering your previous counteroffer of $85.  It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation or paying John's price of $120."
