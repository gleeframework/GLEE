"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly below his maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position. Bob is still within his budget and is aiming to close the gap between their desired prices quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This product is truly valuable, and I'm sure you'll see the benefit of investing a little more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible and knows that Alice is motivated to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also being reasonable by splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that he's serious about buying the product and wants to find a mutually agreeable solution."
