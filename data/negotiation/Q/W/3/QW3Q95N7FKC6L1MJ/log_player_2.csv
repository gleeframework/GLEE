"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He wants to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's offer is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm prepared to offer the product for $8,900. This is a great price for both of us, and I truly believe you'll be happy with your purchase. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. He's very close to his target price of $8,000, and it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get it down just a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a little hesitant at $8,900.  I'm willing to pay $8,800, which I think is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $8,800 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to close this deal at $8,850. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, she's still asking for more than Bob wants to pay.  He's already used up a significant number of rounds and it's unlikely Alice will drop to his ideal price.  It's better to go with the guaranteed $8,000 price from John."
