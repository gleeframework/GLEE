"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and for me, it's a good starting point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and gives you a good profit margin. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer, but still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's my maximum value and allows you to sell the product without taking a significant loss.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
