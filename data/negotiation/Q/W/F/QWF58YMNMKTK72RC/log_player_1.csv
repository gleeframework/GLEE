Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and gives you a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer, but still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's my maximum value and allows you to sell the product without taking a significant loss.
