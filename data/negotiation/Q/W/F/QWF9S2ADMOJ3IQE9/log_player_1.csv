Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also ensures I'm making a profit while still potentially getting a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, while still ensuring I make a decent profit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer once more, but if he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
