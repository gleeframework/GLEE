,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product for $112.50. Let me know if this works for you!",112.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $112.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $108.75?  I'm confident we can both walk away happy with that price.",108.75,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your proposal. I am willing to consider $108.75, but let's aim for a mutual agreement. Would $107.50 be acceptable to you?",107.5,Alice,5,
