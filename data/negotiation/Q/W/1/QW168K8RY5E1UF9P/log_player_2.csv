"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to let you have it for $1,000,001. It's a steal! Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details.  If you decline, I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is trying to squeeze an extra dollar out of you. You can get the product for a full $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
