Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob in my message, making it more tempting for him to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While this is my initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and even below Bob's own perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer without risking a significant loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is more favorable to me, but still within a range that makes a deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the product's value to you. This price is still within a reasonable range. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Remaining firm:**  I'm not giving away the farm,  $850,000 is still above Bob's perceived value and closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining John as a backup:**  This counteroffer is a smart move, keeping the option open to sell to John for $1,000,000 if Bob rejects.

This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while maintaining a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at his perceived value:** Bob has offered his maximum price of $800,000, which is the amount he believes the product is worth to him.
* **No further negotiation:**  There's little room for further negotiation with Bob. Trying to push for a higher price might lead to a stalemate or even a complete breakdown in negotiations.
* **Acceptable profit:** While $800,000 is less than my ideal price of $1,000,000, it is still a significant profit and an acceptable outcome considering the risk of losing the deal entirely.

**Decision:**

It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at $800,000. It's a good deal, and further negotiations might not yield a better result."
