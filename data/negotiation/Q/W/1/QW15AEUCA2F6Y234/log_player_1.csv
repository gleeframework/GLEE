"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While I am willing to negotiate, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob has shown some flexibility in his offers, we're still significantly far apart in price. We only have 4 rounds left, and the time is running out. It's better to sell to John at this point to avoid losing money in the negotiation."
