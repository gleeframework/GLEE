Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be a great value for you, and I'm offering it to you for $145."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might value some unstated aspect of the product higher.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $145 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down. If he's highly interested, he might counter-offer, and we can still settle at a price higher than our minimum ($150). 
* **Considering the Alternative:** It's important to remember we have a guaranteed buyer at $150.  Pricing it too low initially leaves potential profit on the table."
