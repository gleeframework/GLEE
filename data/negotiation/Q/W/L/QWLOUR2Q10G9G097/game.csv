"Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
