"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 180} 

I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is a lot closer to my minimum of $150, I'm still going to reject.  I'm confident we can get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160.  It's still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price, considering his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping we can get to a higher price. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can push for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm going to counter with $150, which is my absolute minimum.  This is my last chance to get my desired price before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for $150, we've gone through several rounds and he's not willing to meet my minimum. It's better to accept John's offer and get my desired price."
