Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I truly believe it's worth it. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $20,000, I can gauge Bob's interest level. If he readily accepts, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects or negotiates, I can adjust my price accordingly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This knowledge gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

By starting with a strong offer and remaining flexible, I increase my chances of maximizing my profit."
