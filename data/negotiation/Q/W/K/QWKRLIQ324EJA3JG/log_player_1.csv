Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $120, which is your minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  It leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher price. 
* **It's a clear and direct offer:** It clearly states the price and provides an opening for conversation. 

By offering a price lower than Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. However, you're also leaving room for negotiation if he rejects it, allowing you to potentially get closer to his value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is above your minimum, you can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations. You know Bob is willing to pay up to $150, so there's still room to increase the price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to send a counteroffer, potentially reaching a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to know if you can meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While you might prefer to get closer to your ideal price, Bob's offer of $132 is still a good deal. It's above your minimum, and you know that there's a chance he might reject your counteroffer. By accepting his offer, you secure a sale and avoid the risk of a failed negotiation."
