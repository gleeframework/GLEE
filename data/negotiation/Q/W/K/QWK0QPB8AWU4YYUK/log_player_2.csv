"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, getting closer to the product's value to her ($100)."
