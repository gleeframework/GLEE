"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below the market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a good starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, hoping to entice Bob to seriously consider the offer. 
* **Setting the stage for negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer if he needs to.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Be prepared to counter-offer:**  I'm ready to make a counter-offer if needed, but I will try to keep my offers above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Monitor the rounds:**  I'll keep track of the rounds to ensure I don't run out of time to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's a compromise, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **I have time to negotiate:**  We're only in round 2. There's still a lot of room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup option:**  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate. Selling to John is a guaranteed profit, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price through negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer with a higher price:**  I'll make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000 or slightly above. 
* **Be firm but flexible:**  I'll be firm in my stance that the product is worth more than $1,100,000, but I'll be willing to compromise slightly to reach an agreement.
* **Keep an eye on the rounds:**  I'll continue to monitor the rounds to ensure I have enough time to close the deal with Bob or fall back to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,127,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's a high risk that I won't be able to reach a profitable deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John guarantees a profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures a significant profit and eliminates the risk of not closing a deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**
