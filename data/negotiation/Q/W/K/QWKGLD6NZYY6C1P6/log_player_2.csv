"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than your maximum budget and her product's worth to her. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice lowered her price, it's still above your ideal target.  Since she stated this is her ""final offer"", it might be a good time to counter with a price closer to your absolute maximum and see if she budges."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to offer a final price of $1,000,000. This is a fair deal considering its value and my constraints."",

```

This counteroffer makes it clear that you're reaching your limit while still leaving a small margin for potential compromise."
