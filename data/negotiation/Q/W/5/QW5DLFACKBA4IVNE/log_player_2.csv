"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,500. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. Since you can get the product for $15,000 from John, it makes more sense to buy from him and save the extra $1,500."
