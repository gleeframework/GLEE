Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get a valuable asset at a price that works for you, and I'll be able to move it quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes the win-win potential of the deal, appealing to Bob's rationality. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Protecting my floor:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and try to gauge his willingness to negotiate. If he's too far off, I'll likely make a counter-offer of my own, gradually lowering my price until we reach an agreement or I reach my floor price, at which point I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the current market and the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear he's trying to lowball me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.  

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. While I need to be flexible to reach a deal, I won't go below my floor price. A counteroffer closer to my initial offer of $1,300,000 is a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** My counteroffer of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it still demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move towards a potential agreement.
* **Appealing to reason:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits of a deal for both parties. 
* **Seeking middle ground:** The message explicitly seeks a middle ground solution, suggesting a path towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my price. However, my counteroffer shows that I am open to negotiation and willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need the price to be closer to my budget.  How about $750,000?  That's a significant offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it shows a slight increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to justify accepting it.  

**Next steps:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my previous offer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I won't drop below my floor price.  If we can't find a solution that works for both of us, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a long way from a fair price. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable offer for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000. 
* **Demonstrating flexibility:**  The message emphasizes that this is a significant compromise on my part, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining my floor:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

**Next steps:**

I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it. If he rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer. However, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm unlikely to drop my price much further."
