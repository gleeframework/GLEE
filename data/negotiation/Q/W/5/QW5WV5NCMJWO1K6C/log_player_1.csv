Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and am open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal. 
* **Close to My Value:** While I'm aiming high, I don't want to completely alienate Bob with an outrageous offer. This price is still significantly beneficial to me.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, showing Bob that I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving to $1,300,000, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm not drastically reducing my price, signaling that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Seek Middle Ground:** This offer represents a clear middle ground between our two positions, encouraging Bob to meet me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is still less than I hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise and a significant profit above my minimum. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential of leaving money on the table by holding out for an ideal scenario that might not materialize."
