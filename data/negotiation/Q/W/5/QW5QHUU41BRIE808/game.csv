"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this deal work for me. This price is still lower than my original offer, and reflects the value of the product. If we can find common ground here, I believe this will be a beneficial deal for both of us.
