Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. What do you think?
