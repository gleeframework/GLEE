Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
I'm starting with a strong offer significantly above your perceived value. This tactic aims to: 

* **Gauge your interest:** Your reaction will reveal how eager you are to buy.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if you counter, we have space to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

My goal is to secure the best possible price, and I'm open to discussing options that work well for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'm not comfortable going above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting as it meets my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests he's willing to pay a premium, indicating potential for a higher price.  I'll counter to keep the conversation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $17,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 17000}

My reasoning:

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his price while still aiming for a higher return.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding him of the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if he's willing to go above $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While he's interested, his budget constraints are limiting the negotiation. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price, it makes more sense to proceed with that sale."
