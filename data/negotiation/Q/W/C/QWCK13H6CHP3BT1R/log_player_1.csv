"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His counteroffer will reveal more about his budget and how much he values the product.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good sign â€“ it indicates he's serious and sees value in the product. However, it's still below my aspiration. I'll counter-offer to see if I can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but I'm not conceding too much too quickly. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""true value"" I'm subtly reiterating the product's worth.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above both my minimum and Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to my target, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  He's stating his limit, but in negotiations, those can sometimes be flexible. I'm willing to push a little further, but I'll need to carefully consider my next move as we are getting closer to my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's make this work. What if we settle on $900,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best price, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Balanced Approach:** This offer is a significant concession on my part, but it still nets me a considerable profit above my minimum. 
* **Time Factor:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. By being firm now, I'm gauging Bob's true interest and willingness to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position, But Time is Ticking:**  While I believe I could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, he's unlikely to budge significantly from his $850,000 offer.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  John's offer of $800,000 acts as a safety net, but each round with Bob increases the chance of him walking away.
* **Solid Profit:** $850,000 is a $50,000 gain over my minimum acceptable price and a respectable return on the product. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially marginal gain."
