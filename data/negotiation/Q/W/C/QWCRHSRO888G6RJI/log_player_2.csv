"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice has come down to a price that's a good deal for Bob, saving him $150,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then potentially increasing her price again, or John changing his mind, makes accepting Alice's offer the best choice in this scenario."
