Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering both our desired outcomes.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still providing you a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and $925,000 is a good deal considering John is only offering $800,000. It's time to secure the sale."
