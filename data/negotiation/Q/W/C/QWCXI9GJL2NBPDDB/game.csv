"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $850000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but I'm willing to make some concessions to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $750000? I'm really interested in this product, but I'm working with a strict budget. ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $800000 to make it worth my while. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
