"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though. How about $11,000? That still leaves you with a good deal, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to save a little more. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
