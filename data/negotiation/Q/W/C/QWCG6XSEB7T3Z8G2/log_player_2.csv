"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, he can potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to enter negotiations and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still above Alice's valuation of $10,000. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.  The message is friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though. How about $11,000? That still leaves you with a good deal, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and he has several rounds left to try and negotiate a lower price.  While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and may be able to secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to save a little more. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money, but he's also demonstrating a willingness to compromise. The offer of $10,750 is a small concession from his previous offer, showing he's taking Alice's position seriously. This also keeps him within his budget, while still potentially getting a good deal. The message is still friendly and focuses on finding a middle ground."
