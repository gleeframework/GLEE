Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? That's still a fair price for you, and it works better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I want to see if I can get a higher price. Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I have 8 rounds left and I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110.  I'm still a little hesitant to go that high.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $115. While $107.5 is a good offer, I'm not willing to settle yet. With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $107.50 is still a bit too low. How about we meet at $109? It's closer to your price and still gives me a bit more than your previous offer."", ""product_price"": 109}
