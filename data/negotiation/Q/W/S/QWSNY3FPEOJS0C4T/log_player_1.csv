Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, and I'd like to save some money on the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While getting to $1,000,000 would be ideal, Bob seems pretty firm on his valuation. Accepting $975,000 now guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of him lowballing further or the deal falling through entirely."
