"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth buying from Alice at $120 when you can get it from John for $100.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's only $10 less than what she values the product at. I'm hoping she'll accept, as it's a better deal than selling to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $105 is still higher than what John is selling it for.  It's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'll buy it from John."
