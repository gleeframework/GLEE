Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at high demand (""interest I've already received"") to justify the price and create a sense of urgency. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not overly aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you get a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to go down to a price that's still beneficial for you, knowing your fallback option with John.
* **Bob rejects:** You move on to John and secure your minimum desired price."
