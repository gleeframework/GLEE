"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for some wiggle room for negotiation, and provides a good starting point for bargaining.
* **Establishing My Value:** This shows Bob that I am serious about getting a good price and that I'm not willing to settle for much less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for a counteroffer that would be mutually beneficial.
* **Not desperate:** I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** This clearly sets the price I'm willing to accept, making it clear that further negotiations might not be fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I still feel that $1,600,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose $1,500,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **John offers the same price:**  John is willing to pay the same amount, and there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation with Bob.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I've already lowered my price to the minimum, so there's little chance of getting a better offer from Bob.

Selling to John provides a guaranteed and immediate deal at my desired price point, making it the most advantageous option in this round."
