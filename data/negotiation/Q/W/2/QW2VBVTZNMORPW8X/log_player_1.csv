Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so anything below that is a loss for me. 
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a negotiation space between $8,000 and $15,000. 
* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a good starting point within the negotiation space. It leaves room for potential compromise.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize my profit:** By starting high, I leave room to potentially negotiate down closer to my desired price.
* **Avoid a long negotiation:** I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my starting offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I still value the product at $15,000, so anything below that is a loss for me.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Sell to John:**  I can get $15,000 from John, so accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss of $5,500.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Avoid a Loss:** Selling to John guarantees a profit, so I'm not pressured to accept an offer that significantly undervalues the product.

**Next Step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I still value the product at $15,000, so anything below that is a loss for me.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob offered $9,500, which is too low.
* **Negotiation Space:** We need to find a middle ground. My previous offer of $13,000 was too high for Bob.
* **Compromise:**  $11,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a decent profit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** By offering $11,000, I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer while still showing flexibility.
* **Avoid a Loss:**  I'm still willing to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer."
