Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than my guaranteed amount.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000,  my opening offer is significantly below my minimum and provides room for him to perceive value in the deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000  gives me leverage.  If Bob rejects my initial offer or negotiations fail, I don't risk losing the sale entirely."
