"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is my initial asking price, I'm open to negotiation. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is a significant drop. How about we meet at $13,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $14,500? That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $13,750?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,6,
