"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $102.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $95? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
