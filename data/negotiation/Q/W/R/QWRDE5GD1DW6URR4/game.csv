"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is its value to me.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $14,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",13500.0,Alice,5,
