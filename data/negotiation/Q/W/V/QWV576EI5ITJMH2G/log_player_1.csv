Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get, not just the price I'm asking. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter, which keeps the negotiation going. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a fallback option if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He's shown interest and acknowledges the product's value. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal value, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard deadline, leaving the door open for further counteroffers if necessary. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between my desire to get a good price and the need to maintain a positive relationship with Bob."
