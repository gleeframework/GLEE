"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure will bring you a lot of value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11250, which would be $10125. Can you consider that?",10025.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your new offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10025. How about we meet in the middle between $10025 and my previous offer of $11250? That would be $10637.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10637.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10637.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10637.50, which would be $9818.75. Can you consider that?",9818.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9818.75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9818.75 and my previous offer of $10637.50, but I'd like to propose a slightly different compromise. How about we meet at $10228.13? This is a bit above your new offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",10228.13,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10228.13 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10228.13, which would be $9614.065. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to go that high. Can you consider going down to $9800?",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you halfway between $9800 and my previous offer of $10228.13, which would be $10014.065. But I'm not willing to go any higher than that. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10014.065,Alice,9,
