"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that reflects that. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
