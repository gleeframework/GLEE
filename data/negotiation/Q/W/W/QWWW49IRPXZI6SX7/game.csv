"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
