"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to save some money. Since Alice is willing to sell it to me for $11,500, which is lower than the $12,000 that John is asking, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer.
