"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1100000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, taking into account the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price, but I need to ensure a fair return for this exceptional product. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000.  This is a price that reflects both the product's value and the benefit it will provide you.  I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the benefit it will provide me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
