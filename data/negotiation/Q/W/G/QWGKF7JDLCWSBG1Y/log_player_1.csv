Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1100000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, taking into account the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to try to close the gap and avoid selling to John for $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the benefit it will provide me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is very close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer is a good strategy for several reasons:

* **High probability of acceptance:** Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and it's likely he won't go much lower.
* **Time saving:** Further negotiation could be time-consuming, and I'm not sure if we'll reach a better price.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  There's always a chance that Bob could walk away, or I could find another buyer who is willing to pay more than $1,000,000. 

While I'd ideally prefer to sell for $1,000,000,  $950,000 is a strong outcome, and I'm comfortable with the decision to accept Bob's offer."
