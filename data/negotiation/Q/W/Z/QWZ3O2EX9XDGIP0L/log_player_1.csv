Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's reaction to the $19,000 price will give you valuable information. If he outright rejects it, you can lower the price. If he counter-offers, you know he's serious. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning other interest, you create a subtle sense of urgency, which might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You can always adjust the price closer to $15,000 if needed, ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
