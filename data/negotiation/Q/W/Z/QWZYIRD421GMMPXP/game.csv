"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  However, I believe the value this product brings to the table is closer to my initial assessment. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
