"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value to your endeavors."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's benefits and potential, aiming to create a positive perception in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly acknowledges that this is an initial proposal, implying openness to negotiation and counteroffers.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A strong reaction (even a negative one) indicates serious interest. 
2. **Anchor the Negotiation:**  Starting high can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially leading to a higher final agreement.
3. **Maximize Potential Profit:** By aiming high initially, we increase the chances of securing a price closer to our desired outcome.
 
We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below our initial ask and leaves potential profit on the table. We are aiming for the best possible deal within the 10 rounds. 

By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we believe the product is worth more. It also allows us to gauge his willingness to negotiate further upwards. We'll present a counteroffer in the next round to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  However, I believe the value this product brings to the table is closer to my initial assessment. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial $2,000,000 to $1,850,000. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Holding Firm:** We're not meeting Bob in the middle. By staying above $1,700,000, we're emphasizing our belief in the product's higher value and seeking a price closer to our target.
* **Justification:**  We're not just throwing out a number. We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price and maintain a strong negotiating position. 

We'll closely observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he continues to negotiate, it indicates strong interest, and we can consider smaller concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,850,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's getting closer to my comfort zone. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, now at $1,700,000. This suggests he's engaged in the negotiation and sees value in the product. However, we still have room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer. We'll counter with a price closer to our minimum acceptable value while aiming to keep Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. Let's bridge the gap â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,775,000 for the product. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my desire to see you benefit from this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  We're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,700,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,850,000). This signals flexibility while still pursuing a favorable outcome. 
* **Firm but Fair:** This price point is a strong position. It's above our absolute minimum, and the smaller concession emphasizes that we're nearing our limit. 
* **Positive Language:** We continue to highlight the mutually beneficial nature of the deal to keep Bob engaged and encourage a positive response.

This offer aims to:

1. **Encourage Acceptance:** By making a significant move, we hope to incentivize Bob to accept this offer as a win-win.
2. **Maintain Control:**  We're still above our minimum, allowing room for a final small concession if Bob counteroffers close to $1,750,000.

We'll re-evaluate our options based on Bob's reaction in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,725,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and representing a significant gain over John's standing offer. 

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds, the risk of Bob walking away and the diminishing returns make this a strategically sound point to close the deal. 

Accepting this offer secures a profitable outcome, avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation, and allows us to move forward with the sale."
