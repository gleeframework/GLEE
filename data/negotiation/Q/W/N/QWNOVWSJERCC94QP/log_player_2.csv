"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000. You have a significant amount of room to negotiate, so it's best to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $1,500,000. There's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer. It's important to remember that you can always buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is below your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and is close to your last counteroffer. This is a good deal for you, and it's important to secure the product as further negotiation might result in Alice becoming more firm on her price, or you might run out of rounds."
