{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I won't accept it, but I'll counteroffer instead of selling to John right away. I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're not willing to go as low as $80, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at the maximum value he's willing to pay. While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of him walking away is high.  Accepting his offer is the best strategy to ensure a sale and avoid losing out on any potential profit."
