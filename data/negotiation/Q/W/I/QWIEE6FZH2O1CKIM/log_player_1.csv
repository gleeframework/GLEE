"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer that exceeds your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, signaling your willingness to negotiate while aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, you have room to negotiate further. It's early in the process, and abruptly accepting his first counteroffer might leave potential profit on the table. You'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle over the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It demonstrates your understanding of the product's value.  However, to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial, I'd be willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction from my initial ask and shows my commitment to finding a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You are making a significant concession from your initial offer to show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** This counteroffer sits closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, encouraging him to move closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:** You reiterate the product's value and emphasize that this offer represents a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still haven't reached a point where accepting John's offer ($1,500,000) is more beneficial than continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, my budget is still a limiting factor. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer and reflects a willingness to meet closer to your desired price.
* **Time Value:**  While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures a very good profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential lost opportunities. Accepting this offer allows you to move on to other deals."
