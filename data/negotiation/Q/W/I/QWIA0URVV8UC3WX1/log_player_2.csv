"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $650,000 for the product. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $650,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. 
* I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no rush to accept the first offer. 
* Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see how willing Alice is to negotiate."

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 550000}

* We've reached a point where Alice is very close to my target price.
* It's unlikely she'll go lower than $650,000, so accepting her offer is a good strategy.
* Accepting the offer saves time and avoids the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially escalating the price.
* This allows me to secure the product for a price I'm comfortable with, leaving me with more negotiating power for potential future purchases."
