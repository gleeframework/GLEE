Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still lower than the product's value to Bob. This should encourage Bob to negotiate, but also leaves room for you to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price and only slightly above your minimum. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for more negotiation and the potential for a higher final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows you are willing to negotiate.  This should incentivize Bob to increase his offer while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for further negotiation and the potential for a higher final price.  While selling to John is an option, the profit margin is minimal. It's better to see if you can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer is a slight reduction from your previous offer but still above Bob's latest offer. This shows you are willing to negotiate while maintaining a significant profit margin. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now equal to John's offer.  Since there's no potential for a higher price from Bob, it's best to accept John's offer and secure the sale."
