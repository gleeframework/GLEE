"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product!  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900,000. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000. It's getting closer to where I'm comfortable.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we've both placed on it.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
