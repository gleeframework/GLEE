"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. It makes sense to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm beginning with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic leaves room for negotiation and helps me understand Alice's flexibility on price. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  While my offer is low, I maintain a polite and interested tone.  I don't want to offend Alice and jeopardize the negotiation.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My ideal outcome is to secure the product for significantly less than John's $8,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $7,500 for the product. It's a great compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, $7,500 is still closer to John's price than my target. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming to edge closer to the $6,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm inching closer to Alice's offer while still aiming for significant savings.
* **Sense of Fairness:**  By suggesting $6,500, I'm emphasizing the idea of a ""fair compromise,"" hoping to appeal to a sense of reciprocity in the negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm mindful that we only have a limited number of rounds, so I'm moving my offer closer to what might be acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,000, which would be $7,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice's offer of $7,750 is only slightly better than John's $8,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a small additional discount, but the difference is now minimal. There's a risk Alice could hold firm or even walk away, leaving me to buy from John anyway. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves time and potential stress of further negotiation rounds.

Overall, while I'd prefer a lower price, accepting $7,750 secures a small saving compared to John's offer with minimal risk."
