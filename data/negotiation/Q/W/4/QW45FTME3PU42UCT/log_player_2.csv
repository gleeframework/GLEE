You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, it makes sense to accept the offer. There's no benefit to rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
