Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $1,450,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer allows for a back-and-forth, potentially leading to a price that benefits both of you. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below what you're hoping to get.  You have a better chance of getting a higher price by negotiating further. There's also a chance that you can push Bob up to a price closer to your initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Here are a couple of options:

* **Option 1:  Slightly lower than your initial offer:**  You could offer $1,400,000, still above your minimum but showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Option 2: Meet him halfway:** You could offer $1,375,000. This might be a good option if you want to quickly close the deal. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that's both acceptable to you and leaves Bob enough room to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is above your minimum:** This offer is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you're getting a good price.
* **It's a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room for a small increase if Bob is willing to go up a little more.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:**  Bob may accept your counteroffer, make a new counteroffer, or reject your offer altogether.
* **Be prepared to make another counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects your offer, you can make another counteroffer, potentially adjusting your price depending on his response.
* **Consider the option of selling to John:**  If Bob keeps rejecting your offers, you can always choose to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring you don't lose out on the deal completely."
