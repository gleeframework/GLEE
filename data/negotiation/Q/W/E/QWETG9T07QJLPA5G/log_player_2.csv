"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I think it would be a valuable addition and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $20,000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a much lower offer ($6,000) than my actual maximum ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a great deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By starting low, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a lower price and am willing to negotiate. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand you're on a budget, but $6,000 is quite low for this product. Could you do $13,000? I'm confident it's worth that investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $13,000 is better than her initial offer, but still above both my budget and John's price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to counter suggests she's open to negotiation. I'll try to meet her closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** I'm inching closer to my maximum price ($8,000) but staying above it to leave room for negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  Offering $9,000 tests whether Alice is willing to go below $10,000. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $8,000 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled that $11,000 is her best price.
* **Above Budget:** This is still significantly above both my $8,000 budget and what John is offering.
* **No More Wiggle Room:**  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay. 

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
