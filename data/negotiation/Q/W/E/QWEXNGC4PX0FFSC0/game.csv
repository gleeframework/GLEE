Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.,800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between our current offers.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a new price of $920000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
