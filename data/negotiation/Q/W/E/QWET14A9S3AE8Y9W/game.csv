"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $900,000 is a significant step away from what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $975,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'm ready to move forward.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I also need you to understand the value of what I'm offering. While I appreciate your movement,  $975,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal: $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
