"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Opening with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even my minimum ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This high opening price will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy the product and how flexible he might be.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me leverage. I don't need to be desperate in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to give up over $100,000 so quickly. I believe I can get a better deal from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $900,000 is a significant step away from what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000 to demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm:** I'm still aiming for a price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to meet me closer to my range. 
* **Time Consideration:** We have seven rounds left. While I don't want to drag this out unnecessarily, I have time to make strategic moves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $975,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'm ready to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, but it's still too far below my minimum. While his language suggests this is his ""final offer,"" experienced negotiators often use this tactic. I believe I can still get him closer to $1,000,000, especially since I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I also need you to understand the value of what I'm offering. While I appreciate your movement,  $975,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal: $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** I'm mirroring Bob's language to signal that I'm serious and nearing my limit.  This could prompt him to make a more serious counter.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm dropping my price by $100,000, a substantial amount, to show I'm flexible and motivated to close the deal. 
* **Above Minimum, Room for Maneuvering:** This offer keeps me above my absolute minimum, but leaves some wiggle room in case Bob comes back with another counter.
* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, so it's time to increase the pressure to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more significant move. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and propose a price of $990,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'm ready to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob.

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob has barely budged from his $950,000 range, and his repeated use of ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John. Each round spent on Bob is potentially costing me money.
* **Strong Alternative:** Having a firm backup offer gives me the power to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet my needs. 

While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth risking the substantial sum John is offering."
