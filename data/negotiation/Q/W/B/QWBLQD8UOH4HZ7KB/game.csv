"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1275000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
