"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $15,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand that might be too high for your budget. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this price is more than fair considering the value you'll be getting.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do something closer to $9,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end and a fair deal for a high-quality product like this.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,250? That's a firm offer from my end.",10250.0,Bob,6,
