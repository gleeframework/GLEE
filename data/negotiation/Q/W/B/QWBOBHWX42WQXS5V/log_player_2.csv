"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, we believe it's worth more than its face value. Considering its true worth and the value it can bring to you, I am offering it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000 and Alice is offering the product at $12,000, there's no potential for saving money by negotiating.  Buying from John immediately ensures Bob gets the product at his budget limit."
