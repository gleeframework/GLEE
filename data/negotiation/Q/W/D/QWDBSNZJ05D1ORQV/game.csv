"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to pay $110, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to sell it to you for $112.50, which is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle.",112.5,Alice,5,
