"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and is likely to be appealing to Bob as it's less than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. It's better to hold out and see if I can get closer to my initial offer or a better counter-offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're both looking to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $12,000, and it's closer to my initial asking price. While I would have liked to get closer to $14,000, it's better to secure a deal now than risk further negotiations and potentially losing out to John."
