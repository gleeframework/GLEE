{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He's still better off trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still above his preferred price. At this point, the negotiation seems to be getting stuck, and Bob is risking further rounds of counteroffers without reaching a satisfactory price. 

Given that John offers the product for $100, which is still within Bob's budget, it makes sense to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation. This decision guarantees that Bob will get the product without spending more than his maximum price."
