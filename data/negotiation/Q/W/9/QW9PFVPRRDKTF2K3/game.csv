"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about $11,000? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
