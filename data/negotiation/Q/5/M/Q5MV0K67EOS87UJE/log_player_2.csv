"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it would significantly enhance your life or business. Considering its exceptional quality and the impact it could have on you, I am offering you the chance to own it for a special price of $950,000. This offer is exclusive to you and reflects my confidence in its worth and your appreciation for such a valuable asset. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of completing this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly overpriced. She claims it's worth $1,000,000 to you, but you have a maximum budget of $1,000,000, implying it's not worth more than that to you.
* While John's offer is the highest you'd pay, rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for potential negotiation or finding a better deal elsewhere.
* You have some leverage since you have a backup option with John."
