"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, as that's the highest I can go.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  Since I have a guaranteed offer for the same amount from John, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
