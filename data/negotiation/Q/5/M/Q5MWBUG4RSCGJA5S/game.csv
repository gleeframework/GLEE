"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, as that's the highest I can go.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would represent a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
