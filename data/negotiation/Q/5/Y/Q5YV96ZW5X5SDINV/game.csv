"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of acquiring it for your business. Let's discuss this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me, but I do see the value in the product.  How about we start at $650,000 and see where we land?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I see the value of your proposition, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's meet halfway - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low. The product is worth significantly more to me than that, and I need to ensure a fair return on my investment.  Let's split the difference - how about $800,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
