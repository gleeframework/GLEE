Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I see the value of your proposition, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's meet halfway - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low. The product is worth significantly more to me than that, and I need to ensure a fair return on my investment.  Let's split the difference - how about $800,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best option for the following reasons:

* **Matches Your Limit:** Alice's offer of $800,000 meets your maximum budget.
* **Better Than John:** While you could buy from John at the same price, accepting Alice's offer prevents any potential delays or complications that might arise from switching sellers.

It's unlikely you'll get a better price from Alice at this point, so accepting is the most logical decision."
