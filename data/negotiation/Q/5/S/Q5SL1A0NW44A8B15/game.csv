"I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product for a one-time price of $1800000. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm making a final offer of $1600000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
