"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm starting the price at $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $140. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $140.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product. I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra investment."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $132.50 is not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $120 and gets us closer to a deal. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether, and selling to John would result in a lower profit."
