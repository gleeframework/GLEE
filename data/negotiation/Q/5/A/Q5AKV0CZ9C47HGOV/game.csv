"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your life.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $12000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $14000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value this product can bring to your life, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's work together to find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. I'm confident that you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $13500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to land closer to $12000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12750. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable compromise.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. I'd like to counteroffer at $13800. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. I'm confident that you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,7,
