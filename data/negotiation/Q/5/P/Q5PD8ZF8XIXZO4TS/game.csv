"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,050,000? This would leave you with a healthy profit, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I've reached my budget limit, and I need to stay within it. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product, and that's my final offer.",920000.0,Bob,6,
