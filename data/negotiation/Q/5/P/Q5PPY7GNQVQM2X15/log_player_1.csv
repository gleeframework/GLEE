Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that maximizes your profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept. Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity, framing it as a desirable opportunity.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong opening offer. It allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while leaving Bob with a perceived gain of $50,000 compared to his valuation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""return on investment,"" you subtly shift the focus from the price itself to the value Bob will gain.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to leave room for concessions.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even in a negotiation, maintaining a positive and respectful tone can lead to a smoother process. 

**Disclaimer:**  This is just one possible offer. The optimal price and approach can vary depending on additional factors and your risk tolerance."
