{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal and worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is the maximum I'm willing to go for now, as I know I can get $150 from John. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay my asking price. If he isn't, I can always fall back on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want to get for the product.  I believe I can get closer to my asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, as this product is truly worth more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing the price by $10, which is a compromise.  This shows I'm flexible but still want to get a good price for the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced it's worth $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. How about $130? Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing him completely and ending up with nothing.  $130 is a reasonable compromise and I'm happy to secure the sale."
