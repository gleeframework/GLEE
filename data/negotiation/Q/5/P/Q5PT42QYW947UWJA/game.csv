"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, as this product is truly worth more. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced it's worth $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. How about $130? Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?,130.0,Bob,4,
