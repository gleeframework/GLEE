Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Is below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate without losing money. 
* **Leaves room for a compromise:** The offer leaves space for a middle ground that benefits both parties.

This initial offer also sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing for further negotiation and a higher chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss. 

I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price, hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offers you a significant value and still allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise that:

* **Reflects my minimum:** $1,350,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer:** This shows my willingness to negotiate and hopefully incentivize Bob to accept. 
* **Offers a reasonable middle ground:** This price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable price and avoid a stalemate or resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offers have been steadily decreasing, and I don't see much potential for him to reach a price I'm comfortable with. 

To avoid further negotiation and ensure I receive my minimum value, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees my desired profit and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
