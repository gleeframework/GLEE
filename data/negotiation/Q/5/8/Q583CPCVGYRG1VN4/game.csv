"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offers you a significant value and still allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
