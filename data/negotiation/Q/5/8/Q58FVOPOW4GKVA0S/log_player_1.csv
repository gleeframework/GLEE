Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us. How does $1,300,000 sound as a starting point for this conversation?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Starting with a higher offer to Bob gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount from John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The message clearly states this is a ""starting point"" and we are open to discussing the price, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a deal above his perceived value.

This strategy aims to find a price point where both Alice and Bob benefit, with Alice securing a price higher than Bob's initial valuation but potentially lower than John's guaranteed offer."
