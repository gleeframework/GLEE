"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least that much to you, and I know you'll find it incredibly useful. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Even though Alice claims it's worth more to Bob, he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
