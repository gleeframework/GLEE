"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $800,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good price.  I'm open to discussing further, but this is my initial counteroffer.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
