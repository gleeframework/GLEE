"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $800,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still a significant amount of money.  Since there are 10 rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore other options and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good price.  I'm open to discussing further, but this is my initial counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There are still several rounds left to negotiate, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and the price of $850,000 is very close to Bob's target.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise, or Bob could run out of time and be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price, without risking a worse outcome."
