Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is significantly less than my minimum, leaving room for Bob to counter and for me to negotiate a price that is beneficial to both of us.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more appealing.

**Note:** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I will carefully consider his counteroffer and my ability to negotiate a better deal. If his offer is too low or if the negotiation seems unproductive, I will move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that is more acceptable.
* **Not desperate:** I'm not desperate to sell immediately, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob. 

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a comfortable margin above my minimum.
* **Compromise and appeal:**  I emphasize the value of the product for Bob and suggest a compromise.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go much lower than $11,000, but I'm open to further negotiation if Bob counters again.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll carefully consider his next offer. If it's still significantly lower than my desired price, I'll likely move on to John, as he's willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob's latest offer is still significantly below my minimum price.  He's not willing to budge much from his initial offer, and the negotiation seems to be going in circles.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my desired price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By selling to John, I'm guaranteeing myself a sale at my minimum price.  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to negotiate a better price with Bob.

It's better to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing with John, rather than risk losing out on a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
