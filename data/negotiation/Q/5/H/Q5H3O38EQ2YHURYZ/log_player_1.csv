"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. I believe its value is substantial, and I'm confident this price reflects that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximizing my profit. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to respond and initiate the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to establish a starting point for the negotiation, gauge Bob's interest, and hopefully achieve a favorable outcome within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I believe the product is worth more than $750,000. It's important to remember my minimum price is $800,000, and I have 8 rounds left to try and secure a better deal.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Explore potential counter-offers:** Gauge how far Bob is willing to go and see if there's room for compromise.
* **Maximize my profit:** I believe I can achieve a higher price within the remaining rounds. 

This decision balances the need for quick action with the potential to earn a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to show you my commitment to this deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop too low. A $900,000 offer is a significant compromise from my initial offer. 
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the value of the product, subtly hinting that it's worth more than the $750,000 he offered.
* **Seeking middle ground:** I'm emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial solution. This encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maintain a balance between my desired price and showing flexibility to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is standing firm at $750,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, I still have 6 rounds left. I'm not giving up yet. There's a chance Bob might budge, or perhaps I can convince him with a new counteroffer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my stance:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm committed to getting a price closer to my initial expectations.
* **Explore further negotiation:**  I can use the remaining rounds to try and find common ground with Bob.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  There's still a chance I can secure a price higher than $800,000.

This decision is a calculated risk, but I believe the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of settling for less."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $750,000 doesn't make this a worthwhile deal for me. I'm prepared to drop to $850,000 to show you my sincerity. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making this clear to Bob that this is my last compromise. This adds pressure and encourages Bob to consider accepting.
* **Fair Price:**  I'm emphasizing that $850,000 is a fair price, implying that it's a good deal for both of us.
* **Closing:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially reach an agreement.

This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my offer before it's too late."
