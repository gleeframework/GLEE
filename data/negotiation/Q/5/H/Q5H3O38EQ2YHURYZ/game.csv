"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900000 to show you my commitment to this deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $750000 doesn't make this a worthwhile deal for me. I'm prepared to drop to $850000 to show you my sincerity. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
