"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95?  That would still give us both a good deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer?,85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your original offer, but I'd like to try to get it a bit lower. How about $87.50? Can you meet me in the middle?",87.5,Bob,6,
