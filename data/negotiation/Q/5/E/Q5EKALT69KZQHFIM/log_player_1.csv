Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting near that figure makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a quicker sale at a still very profitable price.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John. This knowledge gives you leverage to aim high with Bob."
