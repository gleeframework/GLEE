"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-demand item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While the product is worth $10,000 to him, Alice is asking for $12,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as Bob has room to lower the price.  He should try to get closer to his target value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's getting close to his target price, but he still has some negotiating room.  He should continue to try and lower the price, as Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can only go as high as $11,100.  Let's close this deal, I believe this price is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $11,150. This is the best I can do without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's offer of $11,150 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He's already negotiated for several rounds, and the gap between their desired prices is very small.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal and losing the product to another buyer is too high. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his target price."
