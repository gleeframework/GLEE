"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-demand item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can only go as high as $11,100.  Let's close this deal, I believe this price is fair to both of us.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $11,150. This is the best I can do without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150.0,Alice,7,
