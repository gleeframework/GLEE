"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this opportunity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $50,000, bringing the price down to $1,450,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that would benefit us both.  Let's work towards an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of this unique opportunity.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
