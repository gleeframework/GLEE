It's time to accept Alice's offer.  

Here's why:

* **We're close to her limit:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Pushing further might make her walk away.
* **Significant savings:** $13,000 is a $2,000 saving compared to John's offer.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing could be risky if a deal isn't reached soon."
