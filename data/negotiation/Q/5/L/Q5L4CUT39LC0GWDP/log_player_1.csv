Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's increments are getting smaller. He's clearly interested but trying to get a bargain.  We have time for a few more rounds to try and nudge him higher.  I'm not willing to go below $1,350,000 at this point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your commitment to the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $1,325,000? This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled this is his best offer by calling it ""final"" and meeting in the middle. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're running out of rounds, and $1,325,000 is a substantial profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away and having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer."
