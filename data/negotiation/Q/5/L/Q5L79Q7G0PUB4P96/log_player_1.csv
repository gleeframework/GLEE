""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000 from the sale. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $9,500, you're aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation while ensuring a significant profit margin for yourself.

This strategy leaves room for negotiation while still securing a favorable outcome for you if Bob accepts."
