"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little bit.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
