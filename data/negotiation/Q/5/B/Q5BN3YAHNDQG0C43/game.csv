"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1125000 is a bit short of my target.

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price.
