"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  This product has considerable value that I believe justifies a higher price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
