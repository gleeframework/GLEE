"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This provides room for concessions and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""incredible value and potential"" of the product, you aim to anchor Bob's perception of its worth at a higher level.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement"" signals your willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the starting price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be more conservative. I'll offer $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate, especially with 8 rounds remaining. 

You'll counter-offer in the next round, strategically moving closer to a potential agreement while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value this product brings is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation and paves the way for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You've lowered your price by $200,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's value, reinforcing the justification for a higher price. 
* **""Mutually Beneficial"":** This phrase reiterates your goal of a win-win agreement, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between maximizing your profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still feel that $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I can get from the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to your minimum price, but $1,950,000 is still below your $2,100,000 offer.  You have time and room to negotiate. You'll counter-offer again, trying to nudge the price closer to your desired range. You're aiming for a price above your minimum while acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates serious interest.  To show I'm equally invested in finding a resolution, I'm counter-offering at $2,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging the progress we've made in our discussions."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** You've reduced your counter-offer by $50,000, signaling you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* **Appreciation & Investment:** Highlighting Bob's ""serious interest"" and your own ""investment in finding a resolution"" keeps a positive tone and encourages agreement.
* **Finality:** The phrasing ""reflects the true value"" implies this is a strong offer and close to your limit. 

This counter-offer maintains a balance between getting closer to Bob's range while still pushing for a higher price. It's a strategic move designed to either secure a favorable deal or gain a clearer understanding of Bob's true flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $1,900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. While $1,900,000 is tempting, Bob stating  ""this is my final offer"" could be a negotiating tactic. You are still above your absolute bottom line and have time for a counter-offer. By rejecting, you signal you're willing to walk away, which might push Bob to reconsider. 

You'll use your next counter-offer to either try to inch Bob up slightly or to gauge if he's truly firm on his ""final"" offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant decision, and I respect your position. I've tried to be flexible throughout our discussions.  Given the value this product offers, I'm willing to accept $1,950,000.  This is a firm offer on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** You're splitting the difference between your last offer ($2,050,000) and his ""final"" offer ($1,900,000). 
* **""Firm Offer"":** By stating this is your firm offer, you signal this is your final concession. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds left, you're introducing a sense of urgency. 

This strategy aims to get Bob to agree to a price closer to your goal. It's a calculated risk, as Bob might not budge. However, it gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still keeping the deal alive. If Bob rejects this, you're prepared to walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as low as I can, and I need to make a decision. I'll make one more offer: $1,920,000 for the product. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Bob is unlikely to go higher, and you're running out of rounds. While not ideal, accepting $1,920,000 is still a significant profit over your minimum and a better outcome than risking John changing his mind in the last two rounds."
