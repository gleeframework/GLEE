"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the starting price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be more conservative. I'll offer $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value this product brings is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation and paves the way for a mutually beneficial deal.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still feel that $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I can get from the product and my budget constraints.",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates serious interest.  To show I'm equally invested in finding a resolution, I'm counter-offering at $2,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging the progress we've made in our discussions.",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand this is a significant decision, and I respect your position. I've tried to be flexible throughout our discussions.  Given the value this product offers, I'm willing to accept $1,950,000.  This is a firm offer on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as low as I can, and I need to make a decision. I'll make one more offer: $1,920,000 for the product. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",1920000.0,Bob,8,
