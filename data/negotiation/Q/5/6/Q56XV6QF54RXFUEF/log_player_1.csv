"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $6,500 is too far below my minimum.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to try and get a bit more from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000.
