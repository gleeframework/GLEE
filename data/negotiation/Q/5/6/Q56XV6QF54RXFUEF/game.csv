"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500? It's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
