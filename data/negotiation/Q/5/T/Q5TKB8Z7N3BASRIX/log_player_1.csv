Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **For you:**  It's still significantly more than what Bob values the product at, giving you a decent profit.
* **For Bob:** It's a good deal compared to what he'd pay from someone else, and potentially much better than the $15,000 he'd have to pay John.

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting the best price while still making a good deal for both parties involved."
