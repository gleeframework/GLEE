"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for a negotiation and lets him know I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm confident that John's offer of $1,500,000 is a safety net if I can't close with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I need to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's a risk, but I'll accept his offer, knowing that I can still make a decent profit. If I hold out for more, I might lose out on the deal entirely, and I'm not sure I can count on John's offer to be available in the future."
