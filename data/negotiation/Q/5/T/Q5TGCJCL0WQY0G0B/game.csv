"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",875000.0,Alice,3,
