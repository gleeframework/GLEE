Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $900,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable value:** $900,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, so I'm not risking losing out on a better deal.

By offering this price, I'm hoping to initiate a negotiation that will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a better price. I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** I've rejected Bob's offer, showing him I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** My counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight the value:**  I've emphasized the product's value to remind Bob that $875,000 is still a good deal for him. 

This counteroffer keeps me closer to my minimum acceptable value while showing Bob that I'm open to finding a solution."
