"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from what I have in mind. This product offers unique advantages and its value goes beyond typical market comparisons. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $2,050,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,800,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be straightforward.  $1,800,000 is just too low for me to consider. This product has the potential to be a game-changer, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Let's settle this now â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is my final offer.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
