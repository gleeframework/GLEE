``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($15,000), but I'm also acknowledging Bob's lower valuation ($10,000).  This should encourage him to negotiate, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price, but if negotiations continue to stall, I can always sell to John for $15,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
