Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that's higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer, but I'm confident I can still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
