"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm around $750,000.  If you're willing to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work within it. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is close, but I need to stay disciplined with my budget. My final offer is $775,000.  If you can't do that, I understand, but I'm ready to buy at that price.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John for, and I'm willing to give you the same deal. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
