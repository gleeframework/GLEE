# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000.

Alice has come down to her lowest price and it's a fair deal at $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially knowing she was willing to sell at this price to John."
