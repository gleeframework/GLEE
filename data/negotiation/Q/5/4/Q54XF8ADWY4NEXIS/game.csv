"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $140 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $145?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",145.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",135.0,Bob,6,
