Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal and I know you'll be thrilled with it."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer allows for negotiation and the potential to secure a price well above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer gives you space to come down if Bob negotiates. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will influence your next move. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your price, but always aim to get the best possible deal for yourself."
