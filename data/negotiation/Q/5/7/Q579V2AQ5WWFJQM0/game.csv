"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need to be closer to $10,000 to make it work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference again and land at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can do $11,250, which is closer to my original price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out. I'm willing to bump my offer to $10,750, but that's about as high as I can go.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $11,500, which is my previous best offer, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
