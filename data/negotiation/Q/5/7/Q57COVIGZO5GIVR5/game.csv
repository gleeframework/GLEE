"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
