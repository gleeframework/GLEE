"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $14,000. This represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
