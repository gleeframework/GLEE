Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me an idea of his perceived value for the product. 
* **The fallback:** John is my safety net. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always switch to John and get $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he rejects the offer, I will need to decide whether to counteroffer or move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe Bob is interested in the product, evidenced by his counteroffer. There's a chance I can still get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John right now is a sure thing, but it's less risky to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. I'll need to consider how determined Bob seems to be and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  It's still above my minimum acceptable price and allows for further negotiation if needed.
* **Showing flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and makes it more likely that Bob will accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I will need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or finally switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Limited upside:**  Bob is not budging much, and further negotiation might lead to more rounds without a significant price increase.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away completely, leaving me with only the $1,000,000 option from John.

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete. I will finalize the sale with Bob and receive $1,250,000."
