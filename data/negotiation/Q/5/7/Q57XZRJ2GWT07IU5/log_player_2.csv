"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love!  I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than John's price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $110?  This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $110, Bob is saving $10 compared to John's offer, and the negotiation is moving in the right direction. Accepting ensures Bob gets the product and saves money."
