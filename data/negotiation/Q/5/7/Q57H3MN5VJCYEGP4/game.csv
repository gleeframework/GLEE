"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair profit, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
