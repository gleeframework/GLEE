"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below what the product is worth to Bob, it's still a significant amount of money.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. There's potential for a better deal, and he's not under immediate pressure to buy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? This still gives you a significant profit, and it's a price I believe we can both agree on. Let's see if we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit higher than he'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price down further.  He has a safety net with John's offer, so he can afford to be a bit more aggressive in the negotiation."
