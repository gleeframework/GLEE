"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? This still gives you a significant profit, and it's a price I believe we can both agree on. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the transaction at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
