"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so paying $1,500,000 is not a good deal.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me. It leaves room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal rather than risking losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my desired price, and I believe there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $1,150,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  I'm still under Alice's offer, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not ready to accept.  I'm willing to push for a better deal, and with only 5 rounds left, I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm making a final offer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, and it's the same price I can get from John.  I believe this is a fair price, and I hope Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'll have to consider going with John."
