Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, and I'm keen to see it put to good use. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob ($14,000) increases the chance of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000), leaving room for negotiation but ensuring a profitable outcome for Alice. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Alice could choose to start higher and be willing to negotiate down. Understanding Bob's negotiating style and priorities would help refine the offer further."
