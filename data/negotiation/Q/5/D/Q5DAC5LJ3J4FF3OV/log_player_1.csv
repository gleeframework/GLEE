Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's potential:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000, she should start by aiming higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value without being overly aggressive.  This can make Bob more receptive to the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob tends to be very price-sensitive, she might want to start a bit lower (though still above $12,000). 
* **Market Conditions:**  If similar products are readily available at lower prices, Alice might need to adjust her strategy. However, we're assuming in this scenario that the $12,000 offer from John represents a solid backup plan."
