"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $105, Alice. While I'm still interested, I can only do $95 as my final offer.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $95, but it's still a little below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
