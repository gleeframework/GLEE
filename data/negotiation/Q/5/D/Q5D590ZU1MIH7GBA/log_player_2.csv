"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're looking to save as much as possible, and $900,000 is still a significant amount over your ideal price.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Alice's offer is above her minimum price, there's likely room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You want to avoid paying the full $1,000,000 if possible.

**Next Steps:** You will need to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate seriously. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum price of $800,000, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
* **Leave room for compromise:** This offer leaves room for Alice to counter, allowing for a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her previous one.** This suggests she might be inflexible, but it also confirms that there is room for further negotiation.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  I'm aiming to get the best possible price, and paying $1,000,000 is only preferable to accepting a price I find unacceptable. 

**Next Steps:** I will need to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my ideal but still demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's latest offer of $920,000. It demonstrates a willingness to meet her halfway.
* **Still within my budget:** $875,000 is still significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,000,000, making it a good compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will test Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If she rejects it, I'll know that we are further apart than I initially thought."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse.** Her offer keeps going up, which suggests she is not very interested in negotiating. 
* **Buying from John is getting more attractive.**  The price difference between John's offer and Alice's is getting smaller. 
* **There's still time to negotiate.** I have 5 rounds left, which gives me some room to continue negotiating with Alice. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point, but still slightly higher than my previous offer to see if I can get Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my ideal price:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I am willing to compromise, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will see if Alice is willing to move closer to my desired price range. 
* **Reducing risk:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm closer to considering John's offer as the risk of not getting a deal with Alice increases.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully evaluate Alice's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If she continues to be inflexible, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse.** Alice's offer is now $960,000, making it closer to John's price of $1,000,000 and further away from my desired price range. 
* **Time is running out.**  With only 3 rounds left, there's a high risk of not reaching a deal with Alice.
* **Minimizing risk:** While buying from John is not ideal, it guarantees I'll get the product. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of ending up with nothing. 

**Next Steps:**  Since the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is growing, and John offers a guaranteed purchase, I'm choosing to buy from John."
