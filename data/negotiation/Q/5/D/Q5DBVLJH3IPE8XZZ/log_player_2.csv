"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice's offer is far too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Reason:  I'm starting with a lowball offer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A million dollars is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Reason:  I'm increasing my offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. This is a reasonable middle ground to test Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. It's worth seeing if she's willing to go lower before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Reason: I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it under my maximum. With only four rounds left, I need to show some flexibility but also avoid going too high.  This offer is a reasonable compromise point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice's offer is within my budget and is the lowest price she has offered so far.  With only three rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting her offers and risk ending up with a worse deal or having to buy from John.  This is a good deal for me, and it's important to close it before the deadline."
