,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $12,000. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. That's my minimum price, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at this price, but if not, I'll have to explore other options.",15000.0,Alice,7,
