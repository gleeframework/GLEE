,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
