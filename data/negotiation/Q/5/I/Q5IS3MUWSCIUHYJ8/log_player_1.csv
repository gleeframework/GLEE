# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit lower and propose a counteroffer of $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $880,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely."
