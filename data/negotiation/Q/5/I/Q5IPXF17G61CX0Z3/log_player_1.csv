"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer to $975,000.  I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my ideal price while still remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $960,000 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over John's offer.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
