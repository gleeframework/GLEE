"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1175000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and the value it would bring to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway last round, and I'm willing to do the same this round. How about $1087500?",1087500.0,Bob,4,,

"Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1087500. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and our previous discussions.",1150000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'd like to add a condition. If you accept this price, I'd like to get a 2% discount on the total price. This would bring the price down to $1058750. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1075000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the creative offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to accept the 2% discount condition. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'd like to propose a different condition: I'll throw in a one-year warranty for the product, which is a $50000 value. This would bring the price down to $1025000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm adding to the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the offer of the one-year warranty, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full $50000 to me. I'm willing to pay $20000 for the warranty, which is 40% of its value. If we can agree on this, I'd be willing to meet you at $1000000 for the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,8,,20000.0
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm not willing to accept the reduced warranty value, but I'm willing to meet you at $1000000. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: I'll include the one-year warranty, valued at $50000, as part of the deal, and we can meet at the original price of $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm adding to the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I've gone as low as I'm willing to go, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $950000 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000. Please let me know your decision.",950000.0,Bob,10,,
