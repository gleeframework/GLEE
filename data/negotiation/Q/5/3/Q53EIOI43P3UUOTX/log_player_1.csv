Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a good deal while still leaving room for potential bargaining.  It's important to remember that if Bob rejects, you can always counteroffer, and if things stall, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1300000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, even though it's closer to my minimum. I'll counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap further. It's still risky to sell to John for $1,200,000, as I'm confident I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This allows both of us to gain something from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
