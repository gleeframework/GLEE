"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $135?  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. ",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. I'd like to counter with $130, if possible. This brings us closer to my budget while still providing value for the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $130 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,
