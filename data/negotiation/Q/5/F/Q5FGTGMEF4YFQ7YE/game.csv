"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $10000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500, but only if you're willing to throw in some extras that will make it a more attractive deal for me. I'm thinking an additional service or a small discount on the price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. While I'm interested in the product at $11500, I'm not comfortable committing to additional services or discounts at this time.  I'm willing to offer you $11300 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value.  I'm confident that this will be a mutually beneficial agreement.",11300.0,Bob,8,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11400, but only if you're willing to commit to a purchase within the next 48 hours. This will ensure that I can finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities. What do you think?",11400.0,Alice,9,
