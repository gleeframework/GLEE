"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $8,000 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to start negotiations at $9,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at $9,500. This suggests she has room for negotiation.
* **You have room to bargain:**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so you can try to get a lower price.
* **Early negotiation is beneficial:** By rejecting the first offer, you establish a position of wanting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering your product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering your own valuation and my budget, I'd like to offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your budget constraints. To try to find a middle ground, I would like to counteroffer at $9,000 for the product. This still allows for a profit while remaining within your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, but $9,000 is still a significant premium compared to the product's worth to Alice. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  I believe we can find a price closer to my initial counteroffer.  
* **Time is on my side:** With 7 rounds left, I can afford to continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'd like to offer $8,750, which is closer to my initial offer and still allows you a profit margin.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of this, I am willing to counteroffer at $8,900 for the product. This keeps a reasonable profit margin for me while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within range:**  $8,900 is close to my previous counteroffer of $8,750 and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Saving money is important:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might raise her price again. 
* **Time is a factor:**  With 5 rounds remaining, I'm close to a reasonable price and don't want to risk losing the deal.  

By accepting this offer, I save $100 compared to my initial counteroffer and $1,100 compared to buying from John."
