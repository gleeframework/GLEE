"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $8,000 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to start negotiations at $9,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering your product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering your own valuation and my budget, I'd like to offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your budget constraints. To try to find a middle ground, I would like to counteroffer at $9,000 for the product. This still allows for a profit while remaining within your budget considerations.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'd like to offer $8,750, which is closer to my initial offer and still allows you a profit margin.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of this, I am willing to counteroffer at $8,900 for the product. This keeps a reasonable profit margin for me while being more accommodating to your budget.",8900.0,Alice,5,
