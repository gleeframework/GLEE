"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,800. This seems to be a fair compromise between our previous offers.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,900. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12900.0,Alice,5,
