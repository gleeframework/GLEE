"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I need to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob is still offering significantly less than what I consider fair. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, but I need to be careful with how many more rounds I'm willing to spend negotiating."

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm running out of time, but I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,000,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are down to the final few rounds and Bob still hasn't met my minimum price.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a better deal,  I've reached a point where I need to secure the sale and avoid the risk of losing any potential earnings. John is offering a guaranteed price, and it's time to take that deal."
