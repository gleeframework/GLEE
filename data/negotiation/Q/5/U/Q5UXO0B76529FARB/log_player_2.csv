Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,125,000."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,125,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,687,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,687,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,687,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  Let's expedite the process. I'm willing to come down to $1,546,875.  This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly represents the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,546,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,546,875

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and her ""final offer"" suggests she's getting impatient.  It's not worth the risk of pushing her further and potentially missing out on the product entirely. John's price is a guaranteed win at this point."
