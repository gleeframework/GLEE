"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1500000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1750000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000. If we can reach a deal at this price, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1600000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1650000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1650000 is still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1625000.  If you're open to this, I'm confident we can finalize the purchase.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. If we can't agree on this price, I'm willing to consider other offers.",1675000.0,Alice,7,
