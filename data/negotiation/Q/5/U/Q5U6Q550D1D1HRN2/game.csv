"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great starting point for our conversation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal today, but I can only go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to your price, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. To close this deal, I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
