Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I don't immediately settle for a price too low.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price to allow for some negotiation and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.  I'll counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not sacrificing my minimum acceptable price.
* **Middle Ground:** The counteroffer is the average of my initial offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  This presents a fair compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate that this price still represents a good deal for him, highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount, even though it would be a better deal than selling to John. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference between our last two offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my previous offer ($1,075,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to find a compromise without completely sacrificing my desired price point.
* **Maintain Firmness:** I'm still not willing to accept a price below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and friendly, aiming to keep the negotiation open and productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, so how about $1,007,250? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,007,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,007,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,007,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've made some concessions during this negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount.  John's offer provides a much more desirable outcome for me, guaranteeing my minimum acceptable price. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John."
