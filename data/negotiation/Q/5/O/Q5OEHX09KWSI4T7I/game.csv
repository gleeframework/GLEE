"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I feel that's a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider my own interests and the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Alice,7,
