"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to work with you, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for us both to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
