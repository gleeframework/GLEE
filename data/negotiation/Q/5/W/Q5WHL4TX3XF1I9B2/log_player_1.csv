Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this opportunity swiftly."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to $1,500,000 (John's offer) without alienating Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. He might see it as a chance to make a profit in the future while still acquiring the product at a discount from John's offer.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your profit."
