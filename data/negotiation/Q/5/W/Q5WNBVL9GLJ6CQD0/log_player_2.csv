"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  $15,000, Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  Since Bob has no information about the product's value to Alice, it's best to try to negotiate a lower price. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore potential for a lower price without jeopardizing his maximum willingness to spend."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you consider $12,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive, but not too low:**  A $3,000 reduction is substantial but still gives Alice room to negotiate. 
* **Focus on common ground:**  Emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties. 
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** Demonstrates Bob's interest in the product and a desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $13500?  That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:**  $13,500, which is a good compromise, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Bob's Goal:**  Maximize savings.  
* **Strategy:**  Continue to negotiate to see if Alice is willing to go lower.

There's still potential for a better price, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob a chance to secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Reduction:**  A smaller reduction ($500) shows Bob is being reasonable and serious about finding a compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Bob reminds Alice that he understands the product's worth, which reinforces his stance on the price.
* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** By offering $13,000, Bob demonstrates that he's willing to meet Alice halfway."
