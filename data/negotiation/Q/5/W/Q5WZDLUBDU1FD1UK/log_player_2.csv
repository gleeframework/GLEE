"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $15,000.** 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You can make a counteroffer to try and get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's the most expensive choice.** You should try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** This shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away.
* **Stay within your budget:** $12,500 is still below your $15,000 limit.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** You can adjust your offer if Alice counters, but you've already secured a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for a bit more than that. How about $13,500?  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget:**  $13,500 is below your $15,000 limit.
* **You've already negotiated down from $14,000:**  This is a good compromise.
* **Buying from John is still more expensive:** Accepting this offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John. 

While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't go lower. Accepting her offer is the most financially sound decision at this point."
