"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  $900,000 is a significant discount from your maximum price of $1,200,000, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to close the deal.** This means you have time to try and get a better price.
* **Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to counteroffer.** This will show Alice you're serious about buying the product, but you're not going to overpay."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is slightly better than her initial offer, but still above my ideal price.**  
* **I still have 7 rounds left.** This gives me plenty of room to negotiate further. 
* **By rejecting, I can continue to push for a lower price.** I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $850,000 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $887,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $887,500.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being stubborn, but she's also moving closer to my desired price.** She's now only $62,500 above my ideal price. 
* **I still have 5 rounds left.** I believe I can push her further with another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John would be a last resort.**  I'd rather continue to negotiate with Alice as long as possible."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle again at $900,000? This is a good price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to my ideal price.** I'm only $65,000 away from my target of $850,000.
* **I have limited rounds left.**  I'm now down to 3 rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. 
* **Buying from John would be significantly more expensive.** Accepting Alice's offer saves me a considerable amount of money. 

While I'd prefer to get the price down a little further,  I believe accepting Alice's offer is the best option to ensure I get the product at a reasonable price without risking a stalemate or having to pay John's higher price."
