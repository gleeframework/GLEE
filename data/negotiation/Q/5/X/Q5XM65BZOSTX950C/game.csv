"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $887,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product for $912,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle once again.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle again at $900,000? This is a good price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount to get the deal done.",915000.0,Alice,7,
