{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a rationale for the price, hoping to entice Bob into accepting.  I'm willing to negotiate further if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $12,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is only slightly below my minimum of $12,000. It's a good deal considering that I can always sell the product to John for $12,000. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and finalize the sale."
