Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, while also ensuring you earn a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you ($1,000,000 minimum).  Rejecting allows you to try and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer compromises, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above your minimum desired price.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, hopefully encouraging Bob to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $25,000 less than your counteroffer, and it's significantly closer to your minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation might get you another few thousand, but it's likely to be a long and tedious process.  It's better to secure a good deal and sell the product, especially since you have a backup buyer in John."
