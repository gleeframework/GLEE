"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $10,600. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $10,600 is getting closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",10700.0,Alice,5,
