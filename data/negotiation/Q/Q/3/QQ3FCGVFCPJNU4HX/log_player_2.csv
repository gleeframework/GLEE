"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special deal just for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $180 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as you have 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special deal, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $120 for it right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with your maximum:**  I'm opening with the maximum I'm willing to pay. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice that I'm serious about a deal. 
* **Be polite and positive:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and focused on finding a solution, rather than being confrontational. 
* **Give a reason for the offer:**  I've provided a reason for my price (""out of budget""), making my counteroffer seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $160 is still above my budget of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's likely more room to negotiate.  
* **John is a backup:**  I have the option of buying from John, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $135 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** I'm offering a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still staying within my budget. 
* **Reiterate Interest:** I'm reiterating my interest in the product to emphasize my motivation for reaching a deal.
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and respectful to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $150. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $150 is lower than previous offers, it's still above my maximum budget of $120. 
* **John's offer is the best:**  I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120, which is the best price I can get. 
* **No need to continue negotiating:**  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate with Alice could result in a stalemate or an even higher price.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal with John."
