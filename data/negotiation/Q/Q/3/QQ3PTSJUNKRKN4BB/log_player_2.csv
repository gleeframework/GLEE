"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for a product worth so much more. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but I'm looking to spend no more than $12,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget. However, $12,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He has more rounds to negotiate, so he should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,250?  This reflects a good compromise and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about compromise.  $12,250 is closer, but I'm still losing money at that price.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer it to you for $12,375.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget and has already rejected multiple offers.  At this point, he has only 5 rounds left.  While there's still a possibility Alice might come down further, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.  Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees a successful purchase within his budget, while continuing with Alice carries the risk of reaching the round limit without a deal."
