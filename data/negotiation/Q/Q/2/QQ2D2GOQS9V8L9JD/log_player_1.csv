Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of $150, but still gives you a healthy profit.  I'm also leaving some room for negotiation, which will be helpful if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's quick and easy, I'm not going to accept it. $100 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to take, and there's still room to negotiate with Bob for a better price. I'm going to try for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a decent profit. I believe $120 is a fair price that both Bob and I can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations or losing the sale to John."
