"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you first at $13000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is still within Bob's budget and significantly less than John's price.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away entirely is high.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, minimizing the risk of missing out on a valuable item."
