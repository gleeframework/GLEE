Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $13,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,500. Can we meet in the middle on this one? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired price. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $15,500. This is my final offer, so please consider it carefully. "", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll give you $14,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so please consider it carefully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum. While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, I don't want to risk going lower than my minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
