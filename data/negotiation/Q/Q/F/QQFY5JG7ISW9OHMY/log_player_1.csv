Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept less than $10,000, which shows flexibility.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand.

This offer gives you the best chance of starting a successful negotiation with Bob and potentially getting closer to your target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your desired price point. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your goal.  You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price, but still shows flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8750? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly lower than your minimum.  Since you have the option of selling to John for $10,000,  it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your goal.  You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price, but still shows flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8750, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still below your desired price, and you have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000.  It's best to avoid further negotiation and secure the higher price with John."
