{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1100000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer to my target than John's price. Given that Alice has indicated this is her lowest price,  it's likely that further negotiation will be fruitless.  At this point, it's a better deal to accept the offer and save $400,000 compared to buying from John."
