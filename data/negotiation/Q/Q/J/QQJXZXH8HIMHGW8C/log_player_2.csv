Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one. Alice is definitely playing hardball. Here's my thought process:

* **The Trend:** Alice is coming down, but slowly. It seems unlikely she'll drop below $9,000 easily.
* **Time:**  We're getting close to the end of the rounds. If we reject and don't reach a deal, we're stuck with John at $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to push further for a price below $9,000 is risky.  We might save a bit more, but we could also end up with nothing.

Given the factors, it's probably best to take the deal now.
