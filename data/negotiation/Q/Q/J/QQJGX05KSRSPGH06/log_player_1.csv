Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $200 is already a very competitive price. Could you meet me halfway at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $125.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

While I could push for a bit more, $125 is more than Bob initially offered and still a reasonable profit over my minimum. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk losing the sale entirely."
