"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $100 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $125?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
