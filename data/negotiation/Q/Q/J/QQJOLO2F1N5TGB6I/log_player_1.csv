"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  This invites Bob to respond and potentially start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is the absolute bare minimum.  I'm going to try and negotiate a bit higher to get closer to my initial offer.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $100 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $125?  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm giving a reason for my counter-offer to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and aiming to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  This feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $112.50 is a good compromise and gets us much closer to my desired price than my minimum.  We're now only $12.50 away from my starting point, and it's likely that we won't get much closer in the remaining rounds.  With only 6 rounds left, I'm willing to close the deal now."
