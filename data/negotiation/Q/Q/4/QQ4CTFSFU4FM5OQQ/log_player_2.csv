Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This allows for a win-win scenario, and I believe it's a good starting point to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
