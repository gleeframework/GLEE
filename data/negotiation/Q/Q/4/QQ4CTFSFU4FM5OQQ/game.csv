"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering your value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is closer to your minimum requirement and a more fair price considering my valuation. This allows for a win-win scenario, and I believe it's a good starting point to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
