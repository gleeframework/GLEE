"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to consider my other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
