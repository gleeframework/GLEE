# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as high as $12,875.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Deal:**  You're getting the product for $2,000 less than your maximum budget and $1,000 less than her starting price.
* **Time:**  You're over halfway through the rounds. Continuing to push might frustrate Alice and she's unlikely to move much further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings by continuing to negotiate are relatively small compared to the risk of Alice pulling back or the deal falling through."
