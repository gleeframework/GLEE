Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $115, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly signaling this is her near-bottom price. Accepting at $115 gets me the product within my budget and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
