,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $10000? This is my maximum budget for this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $12500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great value for the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product, and it's the best I can offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
