"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget of $12,000.  It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price. I'll reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $15,000 is a fair starting point, considering my $12,000 budget and Alice's initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $18,000 is still outside of my comfortable range. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to buy it for $16,000.  This is the absolute most I can spend right now."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my budget and making another counteroffer.  $16,000 is a good compromise, and it's worth seeing if Alice will accept it. I'm getting closer to my limit, but there's still room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $16000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's valued at $1000. So, effectively, you'll be getting the product for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is very attractive.  While I would prefer a price closer to $12,000, the additional incentive of a $1,000 service brings the effective price down to $15,000.  This is within my budget and a good deal considering the value I'm getting.  Accepting the offer now is better than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John for the full $12,000."
