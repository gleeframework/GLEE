Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Mentioning ""fair price"" helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The threat of selling to John for $1,500,000 is a silent motivator for Bob to negotiate seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Would you be willing to negotiate closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a large loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting it gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** The threat of selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a strong incentive for Bob to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still gives you a good deal.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Finality:** Emphasizing that it's my final offer adds pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Alternative Options:**  The subtle threat of exploring other options reinforces the importance of reaching an agreement.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 is still above Bob's perceived value, but significantly closer to his offer, making it more appealing to him."
