"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. This is my best counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal price point.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action to try and save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price point seems fair given the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,080,000 is still within your budget of $1,200,000 and a good deal considering you've already negotiated a lower price from her initial asking price. It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and might result in you having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best decision in this situation."
