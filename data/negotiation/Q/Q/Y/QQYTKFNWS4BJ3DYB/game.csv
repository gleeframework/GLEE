"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. This is my best counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price point seems fair given the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
