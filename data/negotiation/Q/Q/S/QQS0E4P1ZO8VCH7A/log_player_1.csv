Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than your minimum. This also leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to an even better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob. By rejecting Bob's offer, we can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. The goal is to push closer to the $1,500,000 value, and even a small increase from Bob's offer will be worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a high price. It also puts pressure on Bob to consider a higher price than his initial counteroffer, but keeps the door open for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to him. I believe there's room for further negotiation to achieve a higher price. It's important to remember that selling to John would only yield $800,000, so continuing the negotiation with Bob is the better strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer continues to push for a higher price while still showing flexibility. It's also close enough to Bob's last offer to encourage him to consider a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it is highly likely he will not increase his offer much further.  Considering the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations, accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids the potential loss of a sale. It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk a lower price or a longer, uncertain negotiation process."
