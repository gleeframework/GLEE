"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is closer, but I'm still looking to stay under $90.  Would you be open to $95? ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
