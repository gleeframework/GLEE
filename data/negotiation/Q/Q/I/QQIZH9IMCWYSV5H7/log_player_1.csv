Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $120 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum of $150.  While I could accept it and sell the product, it's not worth it to me at that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a more profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is still a great price, and I believe the product is worth it. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I've made a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to persuade Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is equal to my minimum acceptable price, and also the same as John's offer.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Bob, and I risk losing time and potentially missing out on the sale entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable outcome."
