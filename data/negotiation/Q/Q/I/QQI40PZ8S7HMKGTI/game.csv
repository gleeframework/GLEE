"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $110 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference at $105?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower. How about we meet at $107? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount to make the deal work.",107.0,Alice,5,
