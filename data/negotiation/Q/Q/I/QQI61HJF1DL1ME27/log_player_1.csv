Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the immense value it holds."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While $750,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer, it's still far below both our valuation and what John is willing to pay. We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move this forward, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can go up to $850,000, but that's really the limit of what I can justify.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below our minimum and John's offer.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if he doesn't make a serious offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000 as my final offer. However, I need to be upfront - if we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options for selling the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Firmness:**  It's time to send a strong signal that our bottom line is approaching. By stating a ""final offer"" and mentioning ""other options,"" we emphasize the potential of walking away.
* **Slight Concession:** The price drop to $1,100,000 is a smaller concession than previous rounds, indicating our increasing firmness. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds remaining, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a serious move."
