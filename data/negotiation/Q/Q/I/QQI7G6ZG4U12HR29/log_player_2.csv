# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top budget."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is still a great value for this product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something that will really make a difference. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $110.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $120. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to go below my maximum budget of $100, and we've only got 5 rounds left. It's not worth risking a continued negotiation with her. I'll buy the product from John for $100."
