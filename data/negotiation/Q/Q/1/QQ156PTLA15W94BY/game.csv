"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $120, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product is worth it.",120.0,Alice,3,
