Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents a unique value proposition and could be highly beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($12,000) as possible.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price slightly above Alice's minimum.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a sale. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John without losing any profit."
