Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. I know it's worth $8,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping to get a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm hoping for a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's split the difference and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. Can we make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm getting a little nervous about losing out.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
