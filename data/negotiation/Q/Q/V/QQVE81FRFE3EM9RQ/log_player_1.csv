"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and suggests the product is valuable to Bob. This helps build rapport and potentially make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $100, I leave room for negotiation in the subsequent rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, we can work towards a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** This is a good starting point for negotiation.  It shows that Bob is interested and willing to compromise. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There is a risk that by continuing to negotiate, I might not be able to secure a better price, and could end up with a lower offer in subsequent rounds. 

While I would ideally like to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the potential for a lower offer or a failed negotiation."
