Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $170 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, which might make Bob more likely to counteroffer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $150.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 155}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - how about $150? This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is way too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I've already been negotiating for a while.  I'm going to sell to John for $150 to ensure I get my minimum price."
