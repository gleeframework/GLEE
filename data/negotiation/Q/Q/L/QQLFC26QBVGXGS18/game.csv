"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair offer considering my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
