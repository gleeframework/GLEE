"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a better alternative (buying from John)."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,250 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."
