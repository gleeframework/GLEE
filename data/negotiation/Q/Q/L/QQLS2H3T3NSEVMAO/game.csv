"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? It's still a good price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,500. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product today.",12000.0,Bob,4,
