Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Bob likely sees value in the product, and this price allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial offer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's a good deal, and accepting it ensures a sale without risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
