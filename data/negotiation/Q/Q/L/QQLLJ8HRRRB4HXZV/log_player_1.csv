Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to let it go for $95."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 tempts Bob with a small discount while still securing a profit above my minimum ($100).
* **First Mover Advantage:** By offering it to Bob first, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially leading him to accept a higher price than he might otherwise."
