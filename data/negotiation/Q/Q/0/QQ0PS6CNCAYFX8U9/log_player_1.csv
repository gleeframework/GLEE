{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as much as possible while still appealing to Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my ideal price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to stay within your budget while still getting a great deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my ideal price. It's a good deal for both of us. I'm going to accept it, as it's better than selling to John and it closes the deal with Bob."
