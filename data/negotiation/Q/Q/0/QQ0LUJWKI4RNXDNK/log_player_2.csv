# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This reflects the value I know it holds, while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This allows for a healthy margin for you and ensures I can move forward with this transaction. Let me know if this works for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this. While I value your perspective,  $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

At this point, Alice has come down to $1,200,000.  This is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will not go much lower and we'd end up having to go with John anyway.  Accepting the $1,200,000 offer secures a good price."
