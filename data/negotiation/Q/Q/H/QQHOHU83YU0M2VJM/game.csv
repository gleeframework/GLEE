"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
