Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it would be worth $150 to you, though I could let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Knowing Your Worth:** We know the product's worth to both you and Bob. Offering it at $120 gives you a significant profit margin while still being an attractive price for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, but we've set a strong anchor at $120. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we can always sell to John for our minimum price of $80."
