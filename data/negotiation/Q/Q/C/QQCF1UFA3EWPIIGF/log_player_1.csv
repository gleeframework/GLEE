"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a relatively aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure a good price early on.  However, it's still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want for the product. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm not interested in selling to John at this moment because I can potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's proposal. I'm aiming to find a middle ground while maintaining a price close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my target, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I still believe I can secure a better deal with Bob, and John is always an option if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I'm steadily decreasing my price, but  I'm still trying to get as close to my desired value as possible.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating.  I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be firm in my position. If Bob rejects this, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
