"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $100 from John.  Alice's offer of $85 is good, but there's room for negotiation to potentially get an even better price.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price below $100, so he starts by offering $75.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might make her consider accepting, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's goal of $100, but it's still higher than what Bob would pay to John.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try and reach a price closer to $75. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to work towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's previous offer of $75 was rejected, but Alice's counteroffer of $90 shows she's willing to come down in price.  Bob increases his offer slightly to $80, showing he's willing to compromise while still keeping the price below what he would pay John. This creates a middle ground for potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's only $5 more than what he'd pay John.  With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that further negotiation won't lead to a lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product without having to resort to John and still saves him $5 compared to buying from John."
