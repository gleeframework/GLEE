"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value to you, and it gives us both a good deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range.  While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be open to that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're aiming for $1,200,000, but I can't go that low.  To make this deal work, I'd need to be closer to $1,300,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price and allows for a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
