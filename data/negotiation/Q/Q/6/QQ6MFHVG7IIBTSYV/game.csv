,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my limit. How about we try $10,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering the value it will bring to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal.  While I'd like to accept your offer, $10,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,750? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,900. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to get at least close to my asking price.",10900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,900, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so how about $10,750? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it at that price.",10750.0,Bob,8,
