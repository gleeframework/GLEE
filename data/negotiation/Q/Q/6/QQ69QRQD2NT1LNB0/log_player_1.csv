Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Considering its value to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above our minimum.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, a quick sale to Bob at a higher price is preferable.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or risk tolerance.  Different approaches might be necessary with more information."
