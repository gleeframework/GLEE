Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $95 is closer, but still a bit more than I wanted to spend.  Would you consider $80? If not, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently offered prices significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  While he's inching closer to his maximum value ($80), it's unlikely he'll go much higher. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, which meets your needs. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
