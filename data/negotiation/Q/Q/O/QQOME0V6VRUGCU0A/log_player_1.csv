"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $125. I'm starting to run out of rounds, so I need to be more flexible.  Hopefully, this will be a price Bob is willing to accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only four rounds remaining, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's better than selling to John and is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll likely be able to get a better price if I keep negotiating, but I want to ensure I don't run out of time."
