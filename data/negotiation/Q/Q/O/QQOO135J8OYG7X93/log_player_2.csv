"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your budget of $1,000,000. 
* You have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting and counteroffering again provides more opportunity to reach a deal closer to your desired price. 
* Even though you could buy from John for $1,000,000, continuing to negotiate with Alice might allow you to get the product for a lower price than John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $950,000, which is a significant amount for me and still a fair price given the product's value. I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1025000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to give up more than 5% of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* While there are 5 rounds left to negotiate, you're getting closer to your budget limit, and there's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal than what Alice is currently offering.
* It's more advantageous to secure the product for your maximum budget than to risk further negotiation and potentially miss out on the opportunity."
