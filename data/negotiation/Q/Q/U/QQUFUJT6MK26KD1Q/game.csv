"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm confident that you'll see a considerable return on this investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on it.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
