Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also considering your budget constraints. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1,290,000? This is a fair price that should work for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still too high for me.  It seems like we're not going to find a middle ground, and I'm not willing to risk further rounds of negotiation.  It's time to go with the sure thing and close the deal with John."
