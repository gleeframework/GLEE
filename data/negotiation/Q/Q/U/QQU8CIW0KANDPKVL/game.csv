"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also considering your budget constraints. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,280,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.  Let's make it happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1,290,000? This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
