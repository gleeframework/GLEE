I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a reasonable starting point while still leaving room for negotiation and maximizing my potential profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to try to counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
