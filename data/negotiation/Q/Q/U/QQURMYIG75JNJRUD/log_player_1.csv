Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher final price.
* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a price he's comfortable with. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob understands exactly what you're proposing.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale. Keep in mind that Bob might counteroffer, and you'll need to be ready to either accept his offer, counter-offer, or walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you could potentially get.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter-offer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll have to sell to John for $15,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and gets you closer to your target profit."
