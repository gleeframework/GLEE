"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $1,000,000 is still quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a lot of money, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can always sell to John for my minimum. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $800,000 for this product. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 800000}
