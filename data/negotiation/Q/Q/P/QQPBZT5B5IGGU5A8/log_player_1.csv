Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning I have another buyer, I subtly create a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. While Bob might not go that high, starting at $140 gives me a good buffer to potentially earn more than the $150 John is offering."
