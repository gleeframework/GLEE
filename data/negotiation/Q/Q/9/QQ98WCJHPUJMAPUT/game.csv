"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects its true value.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I value the product at.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $12,500? That's a significant discount from my original asking price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $12,500 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,6,
