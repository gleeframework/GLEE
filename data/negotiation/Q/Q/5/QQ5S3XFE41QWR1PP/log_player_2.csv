"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you!  I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $12,500
* **Your Maximum:** $15,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

While Alice is being a bit manipulative by inflating the perceived value, her offer of $12,500 is still a $2,500 savings compared to buying from John.  It's in your best interest to accept her offer."
