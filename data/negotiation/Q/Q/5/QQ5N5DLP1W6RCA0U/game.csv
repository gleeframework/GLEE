"Bob, I have a product that I believe is of great value to you, and I'm offering it to you first. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the mutual benefit we both stand to gain. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
