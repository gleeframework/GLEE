"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its market value. I'm confident you'll find this to be a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of a better counter-offer, or you can stick with your backup plan (John)."
