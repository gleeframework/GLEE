"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm keen to purchase the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000, which is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $800,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, $800,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $950,000 is pushing my budget.  My best and final offer is $850,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your best and final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is $30,000 below my previous offer. This is my last concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,7,
