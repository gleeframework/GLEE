Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My minimum value:** My minimum value is $1,000,000.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,000,000.

This offer leaves $100,000 on the table for Bob, which is a significant amount, but still below his maximum willingness to pay. This gives him an incentive to accept the offer, as it's still a good deal for him. 

By offering $1,400,000 I maximize my potential profit while still being likely to secure a sale with Bob.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can fall back on John's offer and still achieve my minimum goal."
