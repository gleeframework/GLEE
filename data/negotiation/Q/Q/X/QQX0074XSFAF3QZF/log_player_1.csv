Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Your Minimum:**  It's crucial to stay above your minimum acceptable price ($120) to ensure a profit. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
