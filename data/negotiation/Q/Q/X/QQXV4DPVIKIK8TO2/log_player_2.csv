"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum budget, it leaves a lot of room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have time to negotiate with Alice and potentially secure a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:**  John's price is your absolute maximum, so you can always go back to him if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Given the value you've stated, I'd like to offer $950,000. This allows for a healthy profit for you and fits my budget better."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original price but still leaves room for her to make a profit, making it more likely she'll consider it.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the lower offer, emphasizing both Alice's potential profit and Bob's budget.
* **Next steps:** By offering a lower price, Bob aims to start a negotiation process where he can potentially reach an even lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still significantly above your ideal price point. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate shows she is open to a deal. There's still potential to lower the price further.
* **Avoiding John's high price:**  John's price is a last resort, and you're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,125,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, it's still a bit high for my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between Alice's previous offer and Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justified reasoning:** The message again emphasizes the fairness of the price, highlighting both Alice's profit and Bob's budget constraints.
* **Increased pressure:** By offering a specific number, Bob puts pressure on Alice to accept or counteroffer with a more specific price."
