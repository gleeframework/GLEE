"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,320,000. This is still a bit above what I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to offer $1,310,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,320,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's try $1,320,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",1320500.0,Alice,7,
