"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I place on it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the initial price I was willing to accept.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you at $8,250. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I hope you'll consider it.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,250 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",8750.0,Alice,5,
