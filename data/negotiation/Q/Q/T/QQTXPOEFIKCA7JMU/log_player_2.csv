"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's more than double what the product is worth to Bob.  There's no point in accepting it.  It's better to start the negotiation process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. To demonstrate my interest, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price that's within Bob's budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a considerable adjustment, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget, even with the ""considerable adjustment"".  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is still asking for almost double that.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise while still staying within his budget. It's a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This encourages Alice to continue the negotiation process and potentially reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is undeniable. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  He's still better off continuing to negotiate and trying to get a lower price. There are more rounds available, and it's worth trying to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This offer represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a major step closer to Alice's offer while still remaining within Bob's budget.  It shows Bob is serious about closing the deal and is willing to pay a fair price for the product.  By offering a price closer to Alice's, Bob increases the chances of reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds."
