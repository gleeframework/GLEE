"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7000. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $7,000. This is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.
* **John's Price:** $8,000. You have a backup option if negotiations fail. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start a counter-negotiation and attempt to get a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to work towards a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $6,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $6,800.  This is a significant improvement from her initial offer and gets you closer to your desired price point.
* **Your Counteroffer:** You offered $6,500, and Alice met you halfway. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **John's Price:** $8,000.  Alice's offer is already better than John's.

While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, accepting this offer is a good move.  You've saved $1,200 from John's price and secured a product you're interested in.  It's a reasonable compromise and a good deal for you."
