Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $11,000 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been thinking about it and I'm willing to pay $11,100 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting very close. It's better to take the $11,100 now rather than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for a lower price."
