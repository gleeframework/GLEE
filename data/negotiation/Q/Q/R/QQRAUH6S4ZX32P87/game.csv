"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
