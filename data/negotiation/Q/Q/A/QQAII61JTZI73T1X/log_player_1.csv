Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's lower than my minimum but still allows room for potential negotiation.  It also highlights the product's value, hoping to entice Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'll reject it. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $130. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. It's likely that further negotiation with Bob would lead to a lower price, and the risk of him ultimately walking away is high. 

Selling to John at $150 guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation, which could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a worse outcome."
