"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your $150 maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell. You'll try to get a better price from her before resorting to buying from John."
