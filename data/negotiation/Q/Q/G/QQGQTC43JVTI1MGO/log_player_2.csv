"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $13,000 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her own perceived value of $12,000."
