"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to anchor you to a $1,000,000 valuation, but you know John will sell it for that price. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. This opens the door for further negotiation. 
* You have a better alternative (John) at $1,000,000, so you don't need to accept a price you're not comfortable with."
