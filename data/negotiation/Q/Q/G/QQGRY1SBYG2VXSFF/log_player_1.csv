{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is above your minimum acceptable price but leaves room for some bargaining. It also shows that you are willing to negotiate and are confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I don't want to break the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to push for a higher price.  It's possible to negotiate further and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,300,000? This way, you get a great deal, and I get a price closer to what I'm hoping for."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 below your last counteroffer, and it's getting closer to your ideal price. It's likely that further negotiations would be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly higher price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and gets you closer to your desired outcome."
