{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases the chances of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a discount.
* **Time Value of Money:** A faster sale to Bob, even at a slight discount, might be preferable to waiting for a guaranteed sale to John. 

This offer balances my minimum price with the potential for a quicker, profitable sale to Bob."
