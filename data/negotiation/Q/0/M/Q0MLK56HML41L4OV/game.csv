"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my original target price. I'll meet you at $8,500, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
