"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I think it would be a significant asset to you.  I'm asking for $2,300,000 to start.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is well above what I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify going over $1,500,000. Let's start with that, and see if we can find some middle ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to $1,500,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,700,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I value that. Let's split the difference - $1,800,000, and we have an agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
