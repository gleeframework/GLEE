"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. There are 10 rounds left, giving Bob room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still slightly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. It's a great price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal.  While John is a backup option, continuing to negotiate with Alice has the potential to save Bob more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm ready to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to negotiate, this time offering a price that is exactly halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. This signals Bob's serious intent to reach a deal while still demonstrating a willingness to compromise. By mentioning a ""fair price"" and expressing confidence in finalizing the deal, Bob aims to encourage Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not sure it's enough for me to let go of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,250. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now moved closer to Bob's desired price, and further negotiation may take too long.  While Bob could counter with $13,000 again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and the risk of running out of rounds or needing to buy from John increases. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product within his budget and saves time."
