"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget than it is to her own valuation. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting and providing a counteroffer, you could potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer:

* **Shows interest:**  Acknowledging Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going.
* **Presents a reasonable alternative:** $1,050,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profitable price for her.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  It doesn't go too low too quickly, allowing for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer and countering, you might be able to push the price even closer to $1,000,000 without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer suggests a price directly in the middle of your last offer ($1,050,000) and her current one ($1,100,000).  
* **Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""meeting in the middle,"" you're emphasizing a sense of fairness and cooperation.
* **Pressure:** It puts some pressure on Alice. She's made a smaller concession than you, and accepting this deal would end the negotiation quickly."
