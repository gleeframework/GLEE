Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $16,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm aiming to anchor the price in Bob's mind without directly revealing my motivations.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, I gain a much higher profit.
* **Strong Negotiation Position:** Even if he rejects this initial offer, I'm in a good position to negotiate down, knowing John provides a safety net at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob went straight to my minimum acceptable price, indicating he might be willing to go higher. Accepting his offer now would mean missing a potential profit opportunity. I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation alive and explore if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000  is below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):** By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:** $14,000 still secures a reasonable profit above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This counter-offer will reveal if Bob is firmly rooted at $12,000 or open to moving closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob increased his offer significantly, showing genuine interest and moving closer to my desired range.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether increases. Accepting $13,500 ensures a solid profit and a quick sale.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Prolonging negotiation with Bob means potentially missing out on other opportunities or deals. 

Taking the $13,500 from Bob now represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
