"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what most people are willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential benefit, we're offering this unique opportunity to acquire it for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer of $950,000 is too high.  It's significantly more than her stated value of $800,000, and leaves a lot of room for negotiation. Since I have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is above my current budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you considering your value of $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to come closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. We are willing to consider your offer but need to adjust the price slightly. We propose a price of $850,000 for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $850,000 is still too high. We know she values the product at $800,000, so there's still room to negotiate further. It's worth trying to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $825,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We've carefully considered your proposal and are willing to meet you halfway. We propose a final price of $837,500 for our product. This price reflects our commitment to finding a fair solution while maximizing the value for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $837,500 is a good deal for me. It's only $37,500 above her own valuation, and significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I would pay John. Accepting this offer secures the product while saving me a substantial amount of money. There are only 5 rounds left, and further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price but also risks losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept this reasonable offer and move forward."
