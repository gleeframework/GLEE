"Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is considerably less than its worth to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $15,000 is the lowest I can go and still make this deal worth my while. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
