Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $10,000, it hints at the product's value. This allows Bob to understand it's not an arbitrary number.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000. This allows her to be more confident in asking for a higher price from Bob."
