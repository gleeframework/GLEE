"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  While $115 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of getting a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above Alice's minimum value of $100. This shows a willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear expectation for a lower price.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $105 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's maximum value of $120. It's a significant reduction from the original offer and leaves room for potential counter-offers in the future.
* **Message Tone:** The message is friendly but firm, highlighting Bob's willingness to negotiate while setting a clear starting point for the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping for something closer to $105.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between their previous offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate and reach a deal.
* **Maintain Pressure:** The message reminds Alice of Bob's desire for a lower price, keeping the pressure on.
* **Fair Offer:** $107.50 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum value of $120. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
