"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you think $950,000 is a bit high, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $700,000. Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $825,000 is still a little steep for me. How about $750,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price would be a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. Let's try to get closer to the middle at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a strong offer. I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $830,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're serious about closing the deal, this is my final offer. What do you think?",830000.0,Alice,7,
