Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you think $950,000 is a bit high, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $700,000. Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. Let's try to get closer to the middle at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving back up in price, indicating she might be getting less willing to compromise. We're getting close to the point where her offers won't be much better than John's.  We'll try one more time with a counteroffer closer to her price, but we need to be prepared to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I see where you're coming from. Let's make this final: $780,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're bumping our offer up slightly to show we're willing to negotiate, but we're also setting a firm limit. This price point gives Alice a significant profit while still saving us money compared to John's offer. By stating it's our final offer, we're increasing the pressure to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a strong offer. I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $830,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're serious about closing the deal, this is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at a price that doesn't offer significant savings compared to John. She's signaled this is her final offer, making further negotiation unlikely to result in a much better deal. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at a fixed $1,000,000.  While not ideal, it prevents us from potentially overpaying in a stalled negotiation with Alice."
