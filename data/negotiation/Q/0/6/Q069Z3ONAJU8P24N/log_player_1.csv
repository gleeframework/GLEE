Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $119."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 reasoning:  My reasoning here is to maximize the potential profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to consider. Here's why:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $120.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120.

Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to gain $19 of value ($119 - $100 = $19) while getting me closer to my desired profit margin.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still accept John's offer without any loss."
