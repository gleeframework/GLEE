Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get from other buyers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:**  Highlighting that this is a ""great deal"" for him and that the price is significantly lower than other options (John) may incentivize him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting with a final, non-negotiable price, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially bringing us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000 and well below what John is willing to pay.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while still leaving room for compromise. 
* **Not rushing into a sale:**  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm aiming to maximize my profit.  There's a good chance I can secure a higher price with Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is still a great deal for you, considering what I'd get from other buyers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm coming down from my initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal compared to what he would pay other buyers. This reinforces the idea of a win-win scenario.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm not presenting $1,000,000 as a final price, leaving room for further negotiations and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation with John:** Even if I sell to Bob now, I can still potentially negotiate a better price with John in the future if the market conditions change.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely.  

At this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to secure a sale while still achieving a reasonably good price."
