,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is unfortunately not viable for me, I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to make this deal work. This price still offers you significant value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1100000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, and I'm eager to make this deal work. However, $1100000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to drop my price to $1200000, which is a significant compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1150000 is still below my minimum. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1175000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it still represents a good value for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
