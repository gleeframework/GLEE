"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Could you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already made a concession by offering it to you for $850,000 initially. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering it to you for $750,000.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle on $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're continuing the negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm now offering it to you for $725,000. This is my final compromise, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $725,000 is close, I need to stick to my budget. I can do $710,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering the value and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going below $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $710,000, so I'm now offering it to you for $717,500. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",717500.0,Alice,7,
