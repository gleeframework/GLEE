"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product truly is valuable and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I also need to be fair to the value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $8,900? It's a small adjustment, but I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
