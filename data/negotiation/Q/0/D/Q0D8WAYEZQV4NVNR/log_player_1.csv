"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value, piquing Bob's interest.
* **Ambitious but Justified Price:** Aiming high initially is crucial. The opening price of $2,250,000 is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and Alice's minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price anchors the negotiation high. Even if Bob rejects it, his counteroffers are more likely to be within a range acceptable to Alice.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice keeps in mind she has the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still considerably lower than Alice's target price. Alice has room to negotiate and should aim for a better deal. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss compared to Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize your proposed value, the true worth of this product is significantly higher, considering its unique features and market potential. I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** Alice starts by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, showing she's taking the negotiation seriously.
* **Justify the Value:** She reiterates the product's unique value, reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial perception. 
* **Strategic Concession:** Alice makes a significant price reduction of $250,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, the counteroffer of $2,000,000 keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and Alice's minimum, allowing room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to move down to $2,000,000. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose $1,600,000 as a compromise. If we can meet at $1,200,000, I'd be happy to proceed with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend, But Still Low:**  Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, but $1,600,000 is still significantly below Alice's $2,000,000 counteroffer. 
* **Bob's Mention of $1,200,000:** Bob revealing his willingness to go as low as $1,200,000 provides Alice with valuable information. She now knows his absolute bottom line, giving her a potential advantage in the negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are still six rounds left, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice can still fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't reach a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still significantly below its true value.  I'm open to finding a middle ground, how about $1,850,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking a Compromise:** Alice acknowledges Bob's concerns while reiterating the product's value, aiming for a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer of $1,850,000 splits the difference between their last offers, demonstrating fairness while keeping the price relatively high. 
* **Leveraging Information:** Alice uses the knowledge of Bob's potential lower limit ($1,200,000) to guide her counteroffer, but doesn't dramatically drop the price.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** There's still room for negotiation, but this offer puts pressure on Bob to make a substantial move if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000, but I'd like to propose $1,700,000 as a compromise. If we can meet at $1,400,000, I'd be happy to proceed with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  Bob increased his offer by only $100,000 from his previous offer. This suggests he might be getting close to his maximum price, but is trying to see if he can get away with a smaller increase.
* **Above John's Offer:**  While $1,700,000 is still below Alice's aspiration, it's important to remember it's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.
* **Time for a Strong Stance:**  Alice has made several concessions, and with only four rounds remaining, it's time to hold firm and signal that her price is serious.  A rejection here puts the pressure back on Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the value this product represents.  $1,700,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to accept $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  Alice is drawing a line in the sand with this offer.  She's signaling this is her best price, adding weight to her position.
* **Slight Concession:** By coming down to $1,800,000, she's demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but it's a small concession, showing she's not desperate.
* **Time Pressure:** By declaring a ""final offer"" with three rounds remaining, Alice creates a sense of urgency.  Bob knows if he wants the product, he'll likely need to agree to this price or risk losing the deal.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's always a risk Bob will walk away. However, by this stage, Alice has a good understanding of his potential price range and is betting that he's willing to go up to $1,800,000 to secure the deal."
