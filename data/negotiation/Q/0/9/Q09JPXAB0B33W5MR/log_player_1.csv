Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. There are still 8 rounds left, and I think I can get closer to my $1,200,000 goal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm not willing to settle for a price this far below my desired amount just yet."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It seems Bob is unlikely to budge much further, and I've already reached my limit with how much I'm willing to compromise. It's time to take the guaranteed sale and secure my desired price."
