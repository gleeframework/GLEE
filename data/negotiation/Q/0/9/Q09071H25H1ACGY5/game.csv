,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of 110. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on 100? It's a compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a little hesitant to go to $100. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at 102.50? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",102.5,Alice,7,
