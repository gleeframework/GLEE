"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob.  Alice's offer of $90 is attractive, but there's room for negotiation. It's better to explore if a lower price is possible before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm currently willing to pay. I'd be happy to purchase it for $75.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $75 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $82.50 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially save more. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his $75 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $82.50 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. Let's try $80. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a small adjustment to the price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $81.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price of $80. At this point, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and Bob might end up paying more if he rejects this offer and continues negotiating.  The price of $81.50 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product rather than risk losing it and having to buy from John at a higher price."
