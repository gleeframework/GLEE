,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we both get a fair deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $77.50 for the product.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I understand your position, but $77.50 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $80. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
