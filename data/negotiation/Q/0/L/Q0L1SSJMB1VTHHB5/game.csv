"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18,000 is my initial asking price, reflecting the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but  $12,000 is too low.  How about we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $15,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's try to reach a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $14,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its worth.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
