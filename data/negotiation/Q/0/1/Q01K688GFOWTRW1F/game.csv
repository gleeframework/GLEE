"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $600,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we work something closer to $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $550,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to considering $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a counteroffer of $495,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",495000.0,Alice,5,
