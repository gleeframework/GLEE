Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price from Bob.  It's strategically sound to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk a lower outcome with Bob."
