{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for you to negotiate up if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation moving smoothly."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
