Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Offering it at $1,100,000 allows me to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially preventing him from shopping around or second-guessing the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate. Starting higher gives me some wiggle room while still ensuring a very profitable outcome."
