"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject the offer. Alice's offer is significantly lower than your budget ($1,200,000). There's potential to negotiate a better price, especially since you're willing to pay more than her asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, given the value to me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still below your maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, especially since she's already moved from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming up on your price, but $950,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $975,000. This is as close as I can get to your target price while still ensuring a fair deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, it's still a little low. You can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. There's no guarantee that John will still be available in the next round, so it's worth exploring further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still below my comfort zone.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,012,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $990,000. This is as close as I can get to your target price while still ensuring a fair deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to your target price of $1,000,000.  While you could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will back out or John won't be available anymore.  This is a good deal, and it's better than the $1,200,000 you'd pay John."
