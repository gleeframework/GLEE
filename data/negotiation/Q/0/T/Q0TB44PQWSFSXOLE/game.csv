,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 right now. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135, which is a good compromise. Let's make a deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $140, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm ready to close the deal at $130.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a tough ask, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make one more concession and meet you at $137.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal.",137.5,Alice,7,
