,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $95? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",100.0,Alice,5,
