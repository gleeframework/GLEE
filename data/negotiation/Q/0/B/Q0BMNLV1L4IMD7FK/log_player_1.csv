"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? That's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is a good price considering the value of the product to Bob and the fact that I have several rounds left. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,200,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
