**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget and John's price, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price and might prompt Alice to make a better offer closer to her actual valuation."
