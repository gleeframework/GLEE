"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to get closer to my budget. I'm thinking of $650000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $670000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finally meet on price. I'm thinking of $660000. I've done my research, and I believe this is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, but I'd rather we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",660000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I've made multiple offers, and you've consistently come back with $680000. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and buy the product from John for $1500000. I'm not willing to pay more than $660000, and I think it's time to end the negotiation. I appreciate your time and effort, but I need to prioritize my budget.",660000.0,Bob,10,
