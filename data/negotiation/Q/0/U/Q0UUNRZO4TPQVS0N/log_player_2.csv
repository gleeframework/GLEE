"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which holds immense value to you at $1,000,000. I understand its significance and would like to offer it to you at a special price tailored to make this opportunity accessible. My proposal is to offer the product to you for $950,000. This price not only ensures a substantial return for us but also allows you to acquire an asset of such high value at a premium yet reasonable cost. I believe this is a win-win situation for both parties. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or finalizing the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is highly motivated to sell:** She values the product at $800,000 and is likely willing to go lower than her initial offer of $950,000. 
* **You have a backup plan:** John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for further negotiation and a potentially better price."
