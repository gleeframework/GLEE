Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,025,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
