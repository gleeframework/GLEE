"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $975,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,025,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
