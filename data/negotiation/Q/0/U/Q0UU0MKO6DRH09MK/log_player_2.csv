```

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is still a good price, it's closer to your maximum budget. You can still try to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to close the deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $130, which is still a good price for you. You've already made two counteroffers and it seems like Alice is firm on her price.  At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will result in a longer process, and potentially a higher price from Alice if she gets stubborn. It's better to accept the current offer and secure the product for a good price."
