"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's within your budget, it leaves very little room for negotiation. You want to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're comfortable with, though it's closer to your counteroffer. You want to save as much money as possible, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John and still allows me to get a product I value. I'm hopeful we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You have a clear alternative with John, who is willing to sell for $1,000,000. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to potentially reach a better price or, if unsuccessful, purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,070,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. It's very close to your last offer and still allows me to make a purchase within my budget. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1070000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,080,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You have a safe alternative with John, who is willing to sell for $1,000,000. At this point, the risk of further negotiation not being successful outweighs the potential for a slightly better price.  Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of a complete breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
