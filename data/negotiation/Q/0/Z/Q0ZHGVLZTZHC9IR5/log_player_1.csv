Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
