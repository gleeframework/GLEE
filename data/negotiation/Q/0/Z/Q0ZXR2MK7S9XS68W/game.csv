"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we go with $112.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $116.25? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",116.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $116.25, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we go with $114? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",114.0,Bob,6,
