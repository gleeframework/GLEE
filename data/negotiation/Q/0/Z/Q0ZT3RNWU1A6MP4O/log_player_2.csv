"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Even though it's less than her original value of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum value of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will go lower.  If she doesn't, Bob can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for his maximum price, ensuring he doesn't overspend."
