"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again.  However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
