"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10200 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
