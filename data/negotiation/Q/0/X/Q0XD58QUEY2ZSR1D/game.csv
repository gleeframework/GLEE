"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This price reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still fitting within your budget.",10250.0,Alice,3,
