"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and while there are rounds left, the gap is large.  It's worth seeing if he'll move substantially.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product delivers a lot of value, and I need to get closer to $13,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product brings value, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet closer to the middle at $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this.  I see where you're coming from, but $9,000 just won't work for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to $10,250? That's a pretty significant compromise on my end.
