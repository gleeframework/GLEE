"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $95?  That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle again. How about $100?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
