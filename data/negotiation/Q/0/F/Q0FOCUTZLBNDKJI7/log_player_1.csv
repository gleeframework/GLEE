{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I am willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is below my minimum. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $10,250 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether.  It's a better outcome than selling to John and still allows me to make a decent profit."
