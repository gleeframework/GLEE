"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $11,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has room to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's still a great deal for a product worth so much to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a better price than what John is offering."
