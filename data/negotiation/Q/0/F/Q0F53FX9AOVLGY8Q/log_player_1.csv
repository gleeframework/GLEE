Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 2250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects its potential while recognizing your initial interest."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,350,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
