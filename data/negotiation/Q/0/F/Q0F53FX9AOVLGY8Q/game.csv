"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects its potential while recognizing your initial interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,350,000? That's a significant move on my part.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
