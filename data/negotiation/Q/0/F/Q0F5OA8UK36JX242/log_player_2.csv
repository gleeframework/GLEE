"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay no more than $100, and I have a backup option with John.  Rejecting her offer gives me the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, I'm only willing to pay $100 for the product. If you're willing to accept that price, I'm happy to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $110 is still above my limit. I'm willing to negotiate further, as I have a backup option with John. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $105. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $107.50. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $107.50 is still above my limit.  I'm determined to get the product for $100 or less, and I still have a backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer gives me an opportunity to try and push for a lower price or perhaps even get Alice to accept my previous offer of $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $107.50 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking with my offer of $105. It's a fair price that considers the value of the product, and I believe it's a deal we can both agree on.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $106.50. It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close to my target price, but Alice is still unwilling to budge on $105.  I've made multiple counteroffers, and we're running out of rounds.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a price higher than my limit, I'm going to take the sure thing and buy from John. I can get the product for $100, which is a good deal and avoids the potential for further negotiation and a possible higher price."
