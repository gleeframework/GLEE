"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure I can justify $1,400,000 at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with this sale.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
