{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer gives Bob a significant discount while still allowing me to make a large profit. It also opens the door for negotiation, which could lead to an even better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure I can justify $1,400,000 at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than the $1,400,000 I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with this sale.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
