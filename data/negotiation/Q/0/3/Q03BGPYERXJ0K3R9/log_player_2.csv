"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure I can justify $1,400,000 at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with this sale.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and Bob can still save $100,000 compared to Alice's initial offer. It's a good compromise and worth accepting."
