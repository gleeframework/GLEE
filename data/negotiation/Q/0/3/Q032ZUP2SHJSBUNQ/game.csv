,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems great, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's try to reach a final agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
