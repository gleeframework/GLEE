"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, considering both our perspectives.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our perspectives.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to both of us. Let's try to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession.
