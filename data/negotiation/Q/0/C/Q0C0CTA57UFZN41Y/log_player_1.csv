"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you counteroffering.  While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product holds value, but $15,000 is still quite high for me. Could we possibly agree on $10,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I'm willing to move a bit more. Let's make it $13,500. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has steadily increased his offer, and $11,000 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk him walking away or my offer being rejected in later rounds."
