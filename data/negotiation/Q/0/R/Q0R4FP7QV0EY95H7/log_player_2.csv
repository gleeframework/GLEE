(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a better price than Alice's initial valuation, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  He's aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000, and he has 10 rounds to achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his maximum. This move signals his seriousness about buying the product while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject the offers.  He's still above his target price of $1,200,000. He should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price, hoping to reach a point where Alice is willing to accept his counteroffer or he can secure the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,325,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both show some flexibility."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

Bob is making a slightly higher counteroffer this time, but still below Alice's current price. This shows he's willing to compromise while staying within his budget and keeping the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize this deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,325,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,340,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and ensures we both benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to his target price, he still has the option to purchase the product from John for a lower price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further or if he can secure a better price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,340,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,330,000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1330000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a small but deliberate counteroffer,  demonstrating his commitment to reaching a deal while staying within his budget. He's also subtly reminding Alice that they both have alternative options.  This approach keeps the pressure on Alice to potentially lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your commitment to this deal.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $1,335,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to move forward with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,335,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $1,200,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  He's better off securing the product from John at his maximum price."
