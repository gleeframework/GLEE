"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,325,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both show some flexibility. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take the $1,325,000, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher price, especially with John waiting in the wings for $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize this deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,325,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,340,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and ensures we both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,340,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,330,000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a bit more. I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher price, and I'm still within the 10 round limit. The risk of selling to John for $1,500,000 is always there, but I'm hoping to squeeze out a little more from Bob."
