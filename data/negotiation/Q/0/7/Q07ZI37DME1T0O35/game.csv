"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I can meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $165 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer you $140 for the product.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering I'm willing to pay a premium for this product.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $155, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
