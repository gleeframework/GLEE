"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $700,000? I think this would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, while also acknowledging the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $725,000 is a good deal considering:

* You value the product at $800,000.
* You can buy from John for $800,000.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and then you'll be forced to pay the full $800,000 to John. Accepting Alice's offer at $725,000 saves you $75,000."
