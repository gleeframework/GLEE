"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows his maximum budget is $8,000 and wants to get the best deal possible. He starts by making a bold counteroffer at his maximum price, hoping Alice might be willing to accept it.  This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate. While he could buy from John for $8,000, Bob might be able to get a slightly better deal by continuing to bargain with Alice. There's still potential to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from $8,000 to $9,000, showing he's willing to compromise but still trying to stay within his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates his commitment to the deal while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,500.  This is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While he could buy from John for $8,000, it's likely that Bob can't get a significantly better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He's already made several counteroffers and is getting close to his limit. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product and saves some money compared to buying from John."
