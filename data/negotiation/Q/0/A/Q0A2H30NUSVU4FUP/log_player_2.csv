"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering.  There's no point in even trying to negotiate with Alice."
