"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
