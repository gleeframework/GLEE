"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your desire for a good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save a significant amount. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'd like to make a final offer and see if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
