"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob has incentive to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject the offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but it's a step closer to my goal of earning a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied. There's room to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,075,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but it's still closer to my desired price point.  I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,025,000 is a decent profit and I'm not sure if I can push Bob higher. I'm going to accept this offer."
