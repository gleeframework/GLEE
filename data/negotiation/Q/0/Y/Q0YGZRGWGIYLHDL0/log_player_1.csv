"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it's worth a lot.  I'm starting with a price of $250, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make a profit and $80 doesn't cut it.  I'm going to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $180?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $180 is still above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, how about $160?  This allows me to make a profit and hopefully still fits within your range."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  Would you consider $140?  I'm really interested in this product and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to get a little more from Bob before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's a fair price for both of us and ensures I can make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $145?  It's a small step closer to my goal and I'm very interested in buying your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While $145 is close to my minimum, I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob and I'm not confident I can get him to agree to my desired price in the remaining rounds. It's better to guarantee myself a sale at John's price."
