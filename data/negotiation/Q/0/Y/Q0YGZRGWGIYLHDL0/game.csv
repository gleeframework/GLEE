"Hi Alice, $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $180?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $180 is still above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, how about $160?  This allows me to make a profit and hopefully still fits within your range.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  Would you consider $140?  I'm really interested in this product and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's a fair price for both of us and ensures I can make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $145?  It's a small step closer to my goal and I'm very interested in buying your product.",145.0,Bob,8,
