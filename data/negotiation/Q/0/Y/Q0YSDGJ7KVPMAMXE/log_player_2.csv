"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $900,000.  This is a bad deal for Bob. 

Bob should counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer of $750,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget and a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's important to leave room for compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his value of $800,000.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob has a strong alternative in John who's willing to sell for Bob's maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice his maximum price, $800,000.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he won't go any higher.  He's taking a calculated risk that Alice will accept this offer to avoid potentially going to John and paying the same amount."
