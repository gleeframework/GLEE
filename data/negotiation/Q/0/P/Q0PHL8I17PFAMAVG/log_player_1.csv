"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120, giving myself room to negotiate down. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $135 is a decent starting point that allows for potential counteroffers without dropping below my minimum value of $150. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Exploring potential counteroffers:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. 

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to my initial price of $135. Let's meet halfway again - I'll come down to $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway again by offering a price that's $5 less than my initial offer. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the initial value I placed on the product ($135) to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $128 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is only $3 higher than his previous offer, and it's unlikely I can get him to budge much further.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still have several rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price this low. I believe I can push Bob higher, or at least hold out for John's offer. 

While John is a guaranteed sale at $150, I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $128. While that's a better offer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a good deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer ($128) and my previous offer ($130). This shows that I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterating fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that the proposed price is ""fair for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation positive. 

While $130 is still below my ideal price, I'm starting to feel the pressure. I need to balance the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the chance of getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $126, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $126 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  There's little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing Time:**  We're already six rounds in, and the negotiations are not progressing quickly.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $150 provides me with a guaranteed profit and meets my minimum price.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, the risk of losing Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no sale at all is too high. I'm confident that John's offer is the best option at this point."
