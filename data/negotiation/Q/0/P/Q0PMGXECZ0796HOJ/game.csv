"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $12,500? This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to reach my target. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
