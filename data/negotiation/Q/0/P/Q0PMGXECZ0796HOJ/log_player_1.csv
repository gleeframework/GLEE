"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but leaves room for potential bargaining. It also establishes a friendly tone, hoping to build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd like to get a better price, selling to John right now is not the best option. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $12,500? This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for less than $12,000 yet. Selling to John is an option, but I'll try to push for a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to reach my target. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
