{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's much better to try to negotiate with Alice. $1,200,000 is still too high for your budget. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that reflects the product's value to me. This should signal my seriousness about buying the product, but also my commitment to staying within my budget."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating with her.  I have 7 more rounds before I have to make a final decision.  It's still worth trying to get a lower price."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm not ready to give in yet. I still have 3 rounds and I believe I can get a better deal.  It's worth taking a chance and trying to negotiate further."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm pushing the limits of my budget with this offer, but we're getting closer. This shows Alice I'm serious and willing to compromise. If she rejects this, I might have to consider buying from John, but I'll try one more round."
