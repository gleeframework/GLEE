"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you think it's a bit high, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see the value of this product is worth more than $725,000 to you, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could make a firm offer of $775,000 today. Would that work for you?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more move to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $825,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting very close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $800,000? That's the best I can do.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $825,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
