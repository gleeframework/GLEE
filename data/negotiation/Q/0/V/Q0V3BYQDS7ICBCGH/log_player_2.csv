{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,200,000.  Alice's offer is still quite high, and you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet you halfway."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but you want to save as much as possible. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate and are serious about buying the product.

It shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still too high.  There's no guarantee that she'll go lower, and you have the option to buy from John for a higher price. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a final push to try and reach a mutually acceptable price. It's higher than your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.  It's also significantly lower than Alice's current offer, leaving a small margin for further negotiation if needed.  If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have to decide whether to accept her final price or go with John, weighing the potential savings against the risk of losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and it's unlikely she'll go lower.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll accept your counteroffer, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,500,000. This ensures you get the product while limiting your potential losses."
