"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $15,000? "", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $16,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $15,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $16,500 is still slightly above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $15,500?  I'm very interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  Bob has already gone through several rounds and hasn't been able to secure a price within his budget.  John is offering the product for $15,000, which is the best deal Bob can get. It's time to cut his losses and buy from John to avoid further negotiation."
