"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Would you be open to that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. Would that be more to your liking?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still slightly above my limit. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again at $10,500. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",11250.0,Alice,5,
