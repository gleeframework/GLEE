"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $120.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $110, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and offer the product for $115. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",112.0,Bob,6,
