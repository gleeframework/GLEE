Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider that?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping to get closer to my target with a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target price, I'm still determined to get at least $120 for the product. I'll see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $110, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and offer the product for $115.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. While Bob is getting closer to my target price, we're still a bit too far apart. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid further negotiation."
