"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I believe I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $11,500. This shows further flexibility, but I'm still trying to hold out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. The deal is getting closer, and I want to see if Bob will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting too close to my minimum.  It's a risk to continue negotiating, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John.  To ensure I get a good deal, I'm choosing to sell to John."
