""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,150,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects my desire for a mutually beneficial deal."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing a bottom line doesn't mean rushing there:** While Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is worthwhile.
* **Finding the sweet spot:**  The price needs to be attractive to Bob (saving him money compared to its value to him) while maximizing Alice's profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 allows room for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying comfortably above Alice's minimum.
* **Confidence and clarity:** The message conveys the offer firmly and positions it as a special opportunity, subtly hinting at its value."
