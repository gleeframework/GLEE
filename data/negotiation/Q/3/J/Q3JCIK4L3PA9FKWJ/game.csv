"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $1500000 for it.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the returns. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  That's my maximum budget, so I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This would be a significant gain for you and a fair price for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1125000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential value of your product.  Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
