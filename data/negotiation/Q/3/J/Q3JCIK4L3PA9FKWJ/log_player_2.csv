"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $1500000 for it.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the returns. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It makes sense to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This would be a significant gain for you and a fair price for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,250,000 is lower than her original offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  He should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his maximum budget."
