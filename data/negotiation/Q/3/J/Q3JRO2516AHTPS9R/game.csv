,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not at $100. How about we meet at $98? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",98.0,Bob,6,
