"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I hear you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move on.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000, but I can't go lower than that.  Let's make this happen.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
