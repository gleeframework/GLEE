"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $120. Would you be willing to consider that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $127.50?  It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to get a good deal.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $127.50. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
