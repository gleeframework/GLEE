Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $1,500.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** He still gets a good deal and is likely to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counter-offers, you can adjust your price accordingly. 

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than John's, you can still try to get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $11,150?  This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and you're still making a profit of $1,000.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and continuing to reject offers might risk losing the deal altogether."
