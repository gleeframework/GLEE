Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm asking for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal for something of this quality.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer helps you understand how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects or negotiates, you can adjust your approach.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential demand can make the price more palatable to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he's completely unwilling to meet your price, you can always fall back on your deal with John."
