"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250, which is closer to my original price. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12250.0,Alice,5,
