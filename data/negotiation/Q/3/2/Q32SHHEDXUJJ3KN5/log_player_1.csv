"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still acknowledging the product's significant value. It's important to remember that I have John as a fallback, so I don't have to settle for anything less than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to counteroffer and try to reach a more reasonable price.  I still have 8 rounds left and John as a fallback, so I'm not in a rush to accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still well above Bob's proposal. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price. I still have 6 rounds left and John as a fallback, so I'm not in a rush to accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $850,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I want to see if Bob is willing to come closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 rounds left, and John is still an option, so I will continue to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

This is a final attempt to get closer to my minimum price. It's a significant reduction from my last offer, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've run out of time to negotiate with Bob.  He's not willing to come close to my minimum price, and with only two rounds left, I'm not going to risk losing a sale.  It's time to sell to John and get $800,000 for the product."
