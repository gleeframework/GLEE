"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $6,000. I understand that you're looking to stay within a budget, but I'm afraid the product's value is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7,500. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to be flexible, but I think we can find a better middle ground. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product and my own needs.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer you $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm able to spend.  Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $8,000, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value you place on the product and the fact that we're already at a relatively low price, I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,
