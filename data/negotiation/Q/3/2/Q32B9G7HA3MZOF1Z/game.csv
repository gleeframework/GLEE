"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, and I'd like to offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's high value and potential benefits for your business. I'm open to further discussion, but this is the lowest I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
