"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still offers you a great value considering the product's worth to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I recognize your desire for a lower price, $875,000 still doesn't reflect the true value you'll gain from it.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $887,500. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that both of us can be happy with.",887500.0,Alice,5,
