"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value. I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still offers you a great value considering the product's worth to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm confident I can get a higher price, especially with only 6 rounds remaining. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I recognize your desire for a lower price, $875,000 still doesn't reflect the true value you'll gain from it.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $887,500. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that both of us can be happy with."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $875,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are becoming unproductive. I've made several concessions, but he remains unwilling to budge significantly. With only four rounds left, the potential for a better deal is diminishing.  While selling to John for $800,000 is below my ideal price, it guarantees a sale and ensures I don't lose out entirely."
