Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but it's also lower than the $150 I'd receive from John, leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product,  making Bob more likely to consider my offer. 

This strategy balances the potential of a quick sale to John with the opportunity to secure a higher price from Bob, if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150,  and even lower than the $150 I can get from John. 
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation:** I'm not desperate to sell immediately. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 

This approach aims to secure a better price than Bob's initial offer, while still keeping the option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering $140, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $175.
* **Reasoning:** This price is still above my minimum of $150, but it signals my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages further discussion. 

By offering a counter-offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about a deal while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum. 

This decision prioritizes a guaranteed profit over the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob, which is uncertain and risks the chance of a deal falling through completely."
