"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,250,000? This would be a good middle ground, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
