Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting a strong offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**The Goal:**  You want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than $10,000 (his perceived value), but there's no reason to go below $12,000 since John guarantees that amount.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exclusivity:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a touch of desirability.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $13,500 leaves room for negotiation while staying above your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there"" signals flexibility.

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, there's always a chance Bob might surprise you with a higher offer!"
