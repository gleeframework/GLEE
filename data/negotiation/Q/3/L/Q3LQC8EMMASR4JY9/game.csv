"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, how about we split the difference and go with $115?  That way we're both happy.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, $105 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again -  how about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
