"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price below $140 due to the value it holds for us. However, I'd like to propose an alternative - if you're willing to purchase within the next 24 hours, I can offer a 10% discount on the current price. This would bring the total to $126. Let me know what you think!",126.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the 10% discount, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $126. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Can you meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience, Bob. After considering your request, I am willing to negotiate further. I can offer you the product for $120, which is just above your initial offer, but still below the original asking price. This brings the total cost to you closer to your budget while allowing us to maintain a fair value for our product. Please let me know if this meets your requirements.",120.0,Alice,5,
