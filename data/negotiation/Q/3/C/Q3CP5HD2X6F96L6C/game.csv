"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $12000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it from you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  How about we split the difference and go with $15000? I'm flexible, but that's the lowest I can go.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $15000 is the lowest you can go, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise. Can you consider it?",13500.0,Bob,4,
