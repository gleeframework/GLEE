{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still earn more than my minimum desired amount of $12,000.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make Bob more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $12000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I can still try to get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? I'm flexible, but that's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $15000 is the lowest you can go, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is above my minimum desired price of $12,000, and it's a reasonable compromise given our previous offers.  It's better than selling to John for the same amount, and it keeps the negotiation going."
