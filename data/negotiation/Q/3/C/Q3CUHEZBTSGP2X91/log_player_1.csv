"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving some room for negotiation.  $14,000 is a good starting point, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, considering the product's value to me and its worth to Bob. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $13,500, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit.  This is a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal this round."
