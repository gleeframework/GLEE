"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $12,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to your ideal price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message keeps the tone positive and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $8,000 leaves space for counteroffers and compromise, hopefully leading to a price closer to my $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still above John's price. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get closer to $10,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice is clearly open to negotiation, so I'm pushing a bit further while staying polite and collaborative.
* **Targeting a Midpoint:** Aiming for $9,500 attempts to find a middle ground between her $10,500 offer and my previous $8,000 counteroffer.
* **Expressing Fairness:** Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" emphasizes a win-win solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is my minimum price. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they both offer the same price now."
