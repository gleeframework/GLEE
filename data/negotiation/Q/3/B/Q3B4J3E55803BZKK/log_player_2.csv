"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Offer:** Alice is offering $11,000. 
* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Value to Alice:** The product is worth $10,000 to Alice.
* **Alternative:** Bob can buy from John for $12,000.

This offer is a good deal for Bob. He can save $1,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting and then requiring Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
