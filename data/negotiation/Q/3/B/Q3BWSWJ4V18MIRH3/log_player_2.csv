"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price. Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is courteous but clearly states that the initial offer isn't acceptable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $85 is a significant jump down from $110, but it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($80). This leaves space for further negotiation while signaling that we're serious buyers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. Could you meet me halfway at $97.5? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our price, $97.5 is still significantly higher than our target price. We have room to negotiate further and should aim for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $90? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** We're sticking close to our desired price range while acknowledging Alice's move towards a compromise.
* **Clear Target:**  Offering a round number like $90 makes our target clear and implies this is our desired settlement point. 
* **Urgency:**  As we progress through the rounds, implying we're getting closer to accepting John's offer might encourage Alice to agree."
