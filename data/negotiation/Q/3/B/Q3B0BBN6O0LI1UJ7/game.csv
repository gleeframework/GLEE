"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $8,500 is getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
