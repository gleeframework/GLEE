Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $150 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation, but also attractive to Bob as it's lower than his perceived value. This strategy aims to secure a quick deal, but if Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer or go to John for my guaranteed $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a good price, I can still potentially earn more by counter-offering.  Since my minimum acceptable price is $80, I can still make a profit. I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $85, which is just $5 more than what I can get from John. While I'd love to get closer to my initial target, it's not worth risking losing the deal and ending up with just $80. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
