"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the benefit to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** A $1,000 buffer allows for potential counteroffers while still ensuring I get a good price. 
* **Avoiding the Safety Net:**  I'm confident in my ability to negotiate with Bob and haven't used the ""John"" option as a backup yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Not Yet at a Loss:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is my safety net, but I haven't reached a point where I'm losing money.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially push him closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the price point. 
* **Framing as a Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""significant discount,"" making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** While I'm aiming for $13,000, I'm still open to further counteroffers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** $12,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, but I believe we can still get closer to $13,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm not yet in a position where I need to sell immediately. By rejecting, I can potentially push Bob to offer a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, rejecting allows me to maintain control in the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Avoiding John:**  The ""John"" option is still a safety net, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $12,000.  How about we settle on $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $12,500, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I emphasize ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity in the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm aiming to close the gap and reach an agreement in this round, moving towards a successful negotiation."
