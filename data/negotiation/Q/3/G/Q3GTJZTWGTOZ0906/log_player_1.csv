Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, even more so than you realize. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,000,000.  I'm confident this will prove to be a wise investment for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a generous offer considering the potential return on investment this product offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value it holds, but I have a budget in mind for this purchase. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below what John is offering. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so we have room to push further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's settle at $850,000.  That's a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Could you do $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to reach $1,000,000.  While he's incrementally increasing his offers, we're at the point where the potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. It's time to secure the $1,000,000."
