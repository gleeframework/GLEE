Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum price.
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John, giving you leverage in the negotiation. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
