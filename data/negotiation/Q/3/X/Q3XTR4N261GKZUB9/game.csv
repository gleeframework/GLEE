"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,300,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000, which is still a fair price for the product considering its value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is still a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and call it $1,275,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1275000.0,Bob,10,
