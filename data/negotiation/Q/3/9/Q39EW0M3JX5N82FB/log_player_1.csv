Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows the product's worth to John ($1,500,000) is her safety net. She starts high to maximize potential profit.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:**  The offer is $50,000 below John's price, allowing for some negotiation if Bob pushes back.
* **Value-Focused Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential ROI, appealing to Bob's business sense rather than focusing solely on price.

This approach aims to secure a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible, while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for a deal."
