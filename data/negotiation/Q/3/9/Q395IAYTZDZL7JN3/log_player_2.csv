Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe your offer doesn't fully reflect the unique advantages this product offers.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the value I'm confident this product holds. I've recently received interest from other parties willing to recognize its true worth. To be fair to you, I'm proposing $1,700,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've been transparent about the value of this product and my willingness to negotiate a fair deal. My final offer is $1,400,000. I need a decision from you by the end of the next round. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another interested party. I believe this is a fair offer that allows you to acquire a valuable asset, and I hope we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's unwilling to budge significantly on price. Her ""final offer"" and mention of other buyers are tactics to pressure you. You've already reached a reasonable offer ($1,100,000), and further haggling is unlikely to net you significant savings. John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000 becomes the more attractive option to ensure you get the product and avoid the risk of Alice walking away."
