"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is significantly above its current market value. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 as a starting point for our negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe your offer doesn't fully reflect the unique advantages this product offers. Taking its long-term earning potential into account, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price gap between your offer and my valuation remains substantial. To move this forward, I'm proposing $950,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging the product's potential while remaining within a reasonable market range.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the value I'm confident this product holds. I've recently received interest from other parties willing to recognize its true worth. To be fair to you, I'm proposing $1,700,000.  I need to see a significant move on your end to justify continuing our negotiation.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but mentioning other potential buyers at this stage isn't particularly conducive to building trust in our negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is a significant move on my part.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been transparent about the value of this product and my willingness to negotiate a fair deal. My final offer is $1,400,000. I need a decision from you by the end of the next round. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another interested party. I believe this is a fair offer that allows you to acquire a valuable asset, and I hope we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
