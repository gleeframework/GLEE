"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is truly unique and goes beyond standard market comparisons.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a new proposal, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly under my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push him closer to my range."

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,037,500.  This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair and balanced deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored around the $1,020,000 mark. It's time to show him I'm willing to walk away if necessary.  This might encourage him to make a more serious offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've tried to be flexible, but frankly, I'm disappointed we haven't been able to reach a mutually agreeable price. My final offer is $1,030,000. This is non-negotiable. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your disappointment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,015,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He's trying to pressure me by mentioning John, but his valuation of the product at $800,000 means he wouldn't buy it from John for that price. He's not budging beyond $1,015,000, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
