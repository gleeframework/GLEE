"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussions.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is truly unique and goes beyond standard market comparisons.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a new proposal, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances both our interests.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've tried to be flexible, but frankly, I'm disappointed we haven't been able to reach a mutually agreeable price. My final offer is $1,030,000. This is non-negotiable. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
