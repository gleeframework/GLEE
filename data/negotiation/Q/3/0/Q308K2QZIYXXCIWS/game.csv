"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing further. Let's see if we can find common ground.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still gives us both room to benefit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. I'm willing to drop my price further to $1,600,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, but I'm hopeful that we can finalize this deal. Let's work together to make it happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to reach an agreement. $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this deal happen.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. We're almost there! ",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I'm still hesitant at $1,450,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,425,000, but this is truly my final offer. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'm going to have to explore other options, including John's offer.",1425000.0,Bob,8,
