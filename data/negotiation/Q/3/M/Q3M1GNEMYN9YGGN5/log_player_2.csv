"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, but I understand you may need time to consider it.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer who is willing to purchase it for $1000000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I accept her offer, I'll be paying the maximum amount I'm willing to spend. If I reject her offer, I can buy the product from John for the same price, but I'll have the opportunity to potentially negotiate with Alice for a better price.
