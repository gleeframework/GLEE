"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is too low. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.** I have 8 more rounds and the option of selling to John for $10,000. This gives me leverage. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my target price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a firm but reasonable price:**  $8,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Highlight the value again:**  I reiterate the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify my price point.
* **Encourage closure:**  I use language like ""meet in the middle"" to suggest a final, mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,000. Would you be willing to compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  
* **There is no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a higher price.** I've already rejected two offers and we're getting into the middle ground.
* **Accepting the offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely.**  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's a calculated risk. I'm choosing to secure a sale at a price that's acceptable, rather than risk getting nothing or having to sell to John for $10,000, which is my absolute minimum."
