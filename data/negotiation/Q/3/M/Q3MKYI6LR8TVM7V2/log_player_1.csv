Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer gives you a good chance of maximizing your profit:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **It's lower than John's offer:** If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $100, ensuring you get at least that amount.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while also having a backup plan if he declines."
