"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to you than to me. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $90?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
