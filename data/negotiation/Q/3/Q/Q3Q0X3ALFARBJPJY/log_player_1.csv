Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Why this strategy makes sense:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between these possibilities:

1. **Bob accepts your offer:** You get a great deal, exceeding your minimum price.
2. **Bob negotiates but still buys:**  You potentially make slightly less than $1,100,000 but still more than your guaranteed $1,200,000.
3. **Bob rejects the offer:** You move on to John and get your guaranteed $1,200,000."
