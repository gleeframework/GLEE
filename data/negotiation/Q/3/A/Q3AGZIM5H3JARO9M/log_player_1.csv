Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000 or more. I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than John's offer ($1,750,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, subtly justifying the high asking price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You might need to negotiate with Bob depending on his response. However, having a backup offer ensures you won't lose out on the minimum value of your product."
