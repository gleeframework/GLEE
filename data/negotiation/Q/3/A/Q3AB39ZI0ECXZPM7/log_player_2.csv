"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could get the product for $800,000 from John, Alice's offer is only $75,000 higher.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the potential hassle of negotiating further."
