"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. Given its unique features, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Let's meet in the middle; how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need a better price, but $18,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $12,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's work towards a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything below $16,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.",14000.0,Bob,6,
