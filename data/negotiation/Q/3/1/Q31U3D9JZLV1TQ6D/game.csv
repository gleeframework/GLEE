"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $2000000. It's a rare opportunity to own a valuable asset. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1400000 is significantly below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $1750000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1750000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1450000. This is a fair price considering the original offer was $2000000, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Can you consider this offer?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1450000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  I'm proposing $1600000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
