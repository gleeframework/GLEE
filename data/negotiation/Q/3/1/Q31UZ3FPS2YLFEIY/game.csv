"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1400000 is significantly below what I consider a fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which still allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1500000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
