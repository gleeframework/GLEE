{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it at a special price of $12,000 for a limited time."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" from the eventual selling price.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The ""limited time"" element adds pressure for Bob to make a decision and might make the deal seem more attractive.

**Outcome:**

This offer gives Bob a chance to consider a price that's still beneficial for me.  If he rejects it, I'm no worse off and can proceed with selling to John."
