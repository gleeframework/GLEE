Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $100 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Avoiding Extreme Anchoring:**  Starting too high (close to $120) might make Bob feel like you're trying to take advantage, while going too low risks leaving money on the table.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
