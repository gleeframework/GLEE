"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'd like to reject the offer. Alice is asking for $15,000, but she says the product's true value to her is only $12,000. I can get the same product from John for $10,000, so I'll reject the offer and buy it from John instead.
