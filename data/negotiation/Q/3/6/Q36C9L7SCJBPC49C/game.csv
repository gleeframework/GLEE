"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price provides a fair profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, the product's value to you is substantial, and $1,100,000 doesn't fully reflect that.  I'm willing to agree on $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
