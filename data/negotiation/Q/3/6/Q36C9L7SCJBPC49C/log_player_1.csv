Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price provides a fair profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.
