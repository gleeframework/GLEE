"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle and consider a price of $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to what I believe is a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a significant compromise from my last offer.  I hope we can reach a deal at this price.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the value I've added to the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,130,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.
