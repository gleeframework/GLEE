Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible.  She knows John will pay her full value ($1,200,000), so her offer to Bob needs to be higher.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still staying well above his perceived value. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the price and entice Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a profitable sale to John if Bob declines."
