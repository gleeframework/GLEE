"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,300,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
