"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is above your budget and above what John is offering. It makes more sense to buy from John for $100."
