Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum limit.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it allows you to sell the product while still exceeding your minimum price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
