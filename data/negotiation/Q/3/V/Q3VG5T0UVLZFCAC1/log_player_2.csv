"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I know you'd get great value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $125 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($100), it's still within your budget and a better deal than John's offer."
