"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. It's a great opportunity to get a unique item that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much more than you're willing to pay and even above Alice's own valuation. You should definitely make a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us bargaining room. Aiming closer to $6,000 keeps us well within your $8,000 maximum budget.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating it's unacceptable. 
* **Expressing Interest:** We show continued interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue negotiations. 

This counteroffer is a starting point. We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our approach in the next round if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. However, I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Alice came down a little, but $12,000 is still above your maximum budget. You know you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, so you have some leverage.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's message indicates a willingness to negotiate further. She's open to meeting in the middle, which means there's a chance of getting a better deal.

Let's continue negotiating and see if we can get Alice closer to a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being open to negotiation.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers, say around $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're aiming for a compromise by suggesting a price directly between your last offer ($6,000) and her current offer ($12,000).
* **Staying Within Budget:**  $9,000 is still below your maximum budget of $8,000, but it shows Alice you are willing to move significantly from your initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she's firm on $12,000, we might have to consider getting closer to our $8,000 limit or going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to consider $10,000, which is a bit closer to my minimum price, but I'm still open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But...:**  Alice is definitely moving in the right direction, but $10,000 is still $2,000 more than your backup plan with John.
* **Leverage:** You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no pressure to settle for a price you're not comfortable with.
* **One More Try:** Alice explicitly mentioned she's ""still open to negotiation."" It's worth making one more counteroffer closer to your limit to see if you can get a better deal before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to make this work as well.  How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product from you."",
 ""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is a strong but fair counteroffer. It's above your fallback option of $8,000 with John, but still well below Alice's previous offers.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this would ""allow me to get the product from you,"" you're subtly implying this is your best offer, and she risks losing the sale if she rejects it. 
* **Leaving Room for a Slight Counter:** While unlikely, Alice might counter with $9,000, which you could accept as a final compromise or politely decline and go with John."
