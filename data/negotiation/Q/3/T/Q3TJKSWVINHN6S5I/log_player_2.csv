"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's plenty of room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering his maximum price. This is a strong opening move that establishes a clear boundary and puts pressure on Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above Bob's maximum. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from his initial $1,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but staying well below Alice's price. This demonstrates a desire for a deal, while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant decrease from her previous offers. Accepting this offer is the best strategy, as Bob can secure the product without exceeding his budget. While there's still room for negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will get a better price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
