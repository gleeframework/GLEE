Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy involved:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression of the product's high value. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value"" and ""benefits"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics that might weaken your position.
* **""Exclusive opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of urgency and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might lower the initial offer slightly.  
* **Negotiation skills:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still exceeding your $800,000 baseline."
