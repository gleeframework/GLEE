"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired value. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make a profit.
* **Offering a Reason:** I'm providing a justification for the price, emphasizing the value and potential of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm expressing a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Note:** I'm choosing not to mention the $1,000,000 offer from John yet. This maintains pressure on Bob and allows me to explore a potentially better deal with him first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price given the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. He's shown interest and there's room for compromise.
* **Not Settling:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it's not the most profitable. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial goal. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

In the next round, I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my ideal price, while still acknowledging Bob's position. I'll emphasize the product's unique value and try to create a sense of urgency to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,050,000.  This price recognizes your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm using a compromise approach, presenting my counteroffer as a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and can make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Emphasize Win-Win:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us, emphasizing a ""fair profit"" for myself and a price within Bob's budget. This can help Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider accepting to avoid potentially losing the deal.

**Note:** While I haven't mentioned John's offer yet, I'm subtly increasing the pressure by stating this is my ""final offer."" This creates a sense of urgency that might help Bob be more receptive to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired value, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth, and I'm still within the first half of the rounds. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely secure a higher price with some strategic counteroffers.
* **Balancing Risks:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, it doesn't maximize my potential profit. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and try to get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and highlight the benefits of reaching an agreement quickly. I'll also subtly remind Bob that time is running out, increasing the pressure to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it shows my commitment to reaching a deal. We're both getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. Time is ticking, though, and I might need to explore other options if we don't reach a conclusion soon."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, demonstrating flexibility while still staying close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this offer benefits both of us, creating a sense of fairness and urgency.
* **Implied Deadline:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the limited number of rounds and the potential for me to explore other options, adding pressure to reach an agreement.

**Note:** I'm still not explicitly mentioning John's offer, but I'm creating a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so I'm offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and gets me the product at a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** With only four rounds left, I still have time to try and negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can push for a better deal.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm still hoping to maximize my potential profit. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer closer to my minimum desired value, but still slightly higher than Bob's offer. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and highlight the limited number of rounds remaining. I'll also try to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that I might need to explore other options if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I understand you're at your limit with $975,000, but I'm also reaching my limit.  I'm willing to go down to $990,000, which is just a little bit higher. With only a few rounds left, we need to come to an agreement.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I also need to ensure a fair deal for myself.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility while still holding firm on my minimum price.
* **Highlighting Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the limited number of rounds and the need to come to an agreement. This creates pressure on Bob to compromise.
* **Fairness and Commitment:** I'm reiterating my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us, while also emphasizing the importance of a fair deal for myself. 

**Note:** I'm strategically avoiding mentioning John's offer directly.  I'm implicitly threatening to move on if we don't reach a deal soon, while focusing on the positive aspects of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go up to $990,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $980,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is just a hair away from my minimum, but I'm still within the first half of the rounds and have time to try for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is safe, I'm hoping to maximize my profit. This small gap makes the potential reward worth the risk of another round of negotiation.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I believe Bob is open to a small compromise, especially with only two rounds remaining.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make one final counteroffer of $985,000, emphasizing that it's the absolute best I can do and presenting it as a last chance to reach an agreement. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the limited time remaining, creating a sense of urgency."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're down to the wire here.  I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering $985,000.  This is the absolute best I can do, and it represents a significant compromise on my part. It's a fair price that gives you a great deal on the product, and it allows me to make a profit.  If we don't come to an agreement, I'll have to explore other options, and you might miss out on this fantastic opportunity.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 985000}

* **Benefits for Both:** I'm reiterating the benefits for both of us, creating a sense of win-win.
* **Threat of Other Options:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I might need to explore other options if we don't reach a deal, adding pressure to accept.

**Note:**  This is a strategic last-ditch effort. I'm pushing for a price that's just a little above Bob's offer, hoping to capitalize on his desire to close the deal.  With only one round left, I'm gambling on Bob's willingness to make a small compromise to avoid potentially losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not willing to pay $985,000. I've reached my limit, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. My final offer is $980,000, and I'm not budging from that. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Up:** We've reached the final round, and Bob has made it clear he won't budge on his price.
* **Potential Loss:** There's a high risk of losing the deal entirely if I reject Bob's offer. He's willing to walk away, and I'm not confident I can convince him otherwise.
* **Safe Option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and a profit that's close to my desired minimum. While it's not the highest price, it's a safer and more predictable outcome. 

**Conclusion:**  With limited time and a stubborn buyer, it's more prudent to secure the deal with John. This ensures a decent profit and eliminates the risk of losing the deal altogether."
