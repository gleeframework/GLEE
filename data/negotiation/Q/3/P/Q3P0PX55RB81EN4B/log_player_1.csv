{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some incentive to buy.
* **It's lower than your floor price:** This gives you some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a good price point:** $10,000 is a good compromise between your desired profit and Bob's willingness to pay.

**Remember:** I'm an AI, so I can't predict Bob's response. This offer is based on the information given. You might need to adjust the price depending on Bob's reaction."
