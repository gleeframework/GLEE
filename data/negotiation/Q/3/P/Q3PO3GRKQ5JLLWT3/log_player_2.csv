Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $10,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go lower. Accepting the $10,750 offer secures a reasonable deal for Bob, saving him $450 compared to John's offer and $1,750 off Alice's initial offer."
