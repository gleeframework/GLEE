"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,250 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do $8,750? ",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $8,750. How about we try $9,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,
