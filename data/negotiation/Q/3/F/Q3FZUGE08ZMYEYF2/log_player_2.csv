"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can get the product for less than $100, so rejecting and counteroffering is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'd like to counter with an offer of $95. This still allows for a good profit while remaining competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still aiming to get the product for less than $95.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives you the chance to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
