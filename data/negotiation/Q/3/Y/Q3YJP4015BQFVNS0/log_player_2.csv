{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but it's still worth trying to save a few more dollars before resorting to John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting very close to what I had in mind.  How about we finalize the deal at $110?"",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go down to $110, but I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll sell the product to you for $114.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower than $114. While I could continue negotiating, John's offer of $120 is only slightly more expensive. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potentially minimal saving."
