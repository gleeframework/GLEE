Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'll make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $91. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've negotiated down to $91, which is close to your target, but you only have 3 rounds left. It's a risky gamble to keep negotiating because you might not get a better deal.  It's best to secure the product from John at $80 and save yourself the risk."
