{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and counter-offer. You can likely get a better price from Alice, or at least get closer to your $10,000 limit.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you're serious about getting a good deal. It's a significant reduction from her initial offer, but still leaves room for some bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is within your budget and only $500 more than John's price. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product."
