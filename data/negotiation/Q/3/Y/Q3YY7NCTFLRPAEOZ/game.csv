"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's still a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,7,
