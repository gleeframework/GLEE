"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation while still maximizing your potential profit. Remember, you can always sell to John for $800,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and gets me a significant discount. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum desired price of $800,000.  You want to maximize your profit and see if you can secure a higher price. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to $925000.  This would still be a profitable deal for you and a great price for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're close to your minimum price with Bob's offer, but you're still hoping to secure a higher price.  The risk of selling to John for $800,000 is now very real.  It's important to try and see if you can get Bob to increase his offer just a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling a little squeezed at $925,000.  Let's compromise one last time at $940,000.  This is a great price for you and still lets me make a decent profit. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}
