"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value, while still ensuring a fair return for me.  I'm offering it to you for $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,1,
