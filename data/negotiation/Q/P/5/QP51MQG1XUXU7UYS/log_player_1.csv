Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. Here's why:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, meaning you still make a decent profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $9,500 is less than the $10,000 value Bob places on the product, making it a good deal for him.  

This makes it a win-win scenario for both of you."
