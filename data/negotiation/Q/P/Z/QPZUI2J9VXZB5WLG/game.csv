"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still give you a great deal while allowing me to get closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
