Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage in the process.
* **Appealing to his self-interest:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to him, which is a key motivator.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly tone helps to build rapport and create a more positive negotiation environment.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's within my acceptable range. I'm prepared to make counteroffers myself to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a great price and a successful negotiation.
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  I'll be prepared to move on to John, who will pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than what John is willing to pay.

**Next step:** I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I want to push for a price closer to my desired amount while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still give you a great deal while allowing me to get closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob that $850,000 still represents a significant saving compared to the product's value to him ($1,200,000).
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm aiming to keep the negotiation amicable and open to finding a solution. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a successful negotiation and secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close enough to my target) or make a new counteroffer to continue the negotiation.
* **If negotiation stalls:** I'll be prepared to sell to John for $800,000 as a backup plan."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further negotiation needed:**  There's no need to continue negotiation since I've reached my desired minimum.
* **Avoiding potential loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John at the same price.

**Next step:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
