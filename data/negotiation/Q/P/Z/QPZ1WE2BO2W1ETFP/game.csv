"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, I believe your starting price is a bit too aggressive. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us. I'm eager to move forward with this deal if you're agreeable.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value and the time we've invested in preparing it for sale, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to move forward.",750000.0,Alice,3,
