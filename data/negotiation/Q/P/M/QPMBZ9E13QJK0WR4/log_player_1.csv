Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's valuation increases the chances of a higher profit margin for you.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down,  keeping you above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John at $8,000, so you're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you make a sale."
