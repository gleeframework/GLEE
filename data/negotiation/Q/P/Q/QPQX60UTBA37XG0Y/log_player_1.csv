"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's worth to Bob ($800,000). We have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is a better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects a reasonable compromise.  This is my best offer. Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $750000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to what I'd like, $750,000 is still below the product's true value to him and below my floor.  We still have 6 rounds left, so there's room to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
