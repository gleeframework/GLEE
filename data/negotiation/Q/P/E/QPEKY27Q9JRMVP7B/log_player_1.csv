Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob is willing to pay a significant amount ($10,000) and her minimum is $12,000. Starting at $13,500 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to her ideal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value,"" Alice subtly justifies the higher price without revealing her hand completely. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests flexibility. Alice wants to understand Bob's perspective and leaves room for a counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
