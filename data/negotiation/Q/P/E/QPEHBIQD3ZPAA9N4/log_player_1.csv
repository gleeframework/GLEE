{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals to Bob that I am serious about selling but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's still a great deal for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $950,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement quickly.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still thinking $825,000 is a fair price for this product. It's a bit lower than your previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and the value of the product to me is $800,000. Continuing the negotiation might not get me a significantly higher price, and it's better to secure a sale rather than risk losing Bob as a buyer."
