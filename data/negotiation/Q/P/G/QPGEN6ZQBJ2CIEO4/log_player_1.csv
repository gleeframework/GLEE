Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 if Bob refuses.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a small ""discount"" while maximizing my potential profit. If Bob accepts, I make $19 more than selling it at his valuation. If he rejects, I still have John."
