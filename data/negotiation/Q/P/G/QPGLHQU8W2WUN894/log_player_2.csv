You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is not budging from her $10,000 price, which is her value for the product. Since you can buy it from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You might as well buy from John and avoid any potential hassle or further negotiation."
