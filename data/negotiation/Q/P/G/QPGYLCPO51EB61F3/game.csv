"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is quite limited. Could you consider lowering the price to $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12500? It's a fair price that I think we can both be comfortable with.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $12500 due to my budget constraints. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further to $11000? This would allow me to consider your offer more seriously.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12000? It's my lowest price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I really appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not able to meet you at $12000 given my current financial constraints. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $11500? This would be a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,
