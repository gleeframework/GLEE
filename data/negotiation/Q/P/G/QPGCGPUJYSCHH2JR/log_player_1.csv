Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a decent profit margin.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and get a sense of his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000. I'm not yet ready to settle for the minimum, especially since I know I can get $8,000 from John. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $9,000.  This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit that's above my minimum. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept the offer, as it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,500. While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's significantly better than my minimum acceptable price and a better deal than selling to John for $8,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to close the deal."
