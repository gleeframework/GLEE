"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's seal the deal!",9250.0,Alice,5,
