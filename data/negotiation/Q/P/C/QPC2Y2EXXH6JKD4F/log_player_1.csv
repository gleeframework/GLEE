Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it's worth the price. Would you be willing to pay $150 for it?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always lower the price or move to John.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net. You don't have to desperately lowball Bob."
