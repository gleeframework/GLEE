Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to potentially entice Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than Bob's estimated value of the product. It's better to hold out for a better offer. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still allows me to get a fair price for my product, while leaving some room for negotiation for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my desired price and still a good deal for him.  While I could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or I might end up selling to John for less. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
