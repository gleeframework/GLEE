While tempting, I'm going to stick to my guns and reject Bob's offer. He's been steadily increasing his counteroffer, but I'm confident I can secure a better price with one more push.  I want to reach at least $1,850,000."

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation, and it's time to make a tough decision.  While Bob has shown interest, he's clearly unwilling to budge much further.  I'm running out of rounds, and I'm concerned I might not reach my minimum price.  

Given the circumstances, it's in my best interest to secure a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I receive a fair price for my product, albeit not the ideal outcome I was hoping for."
