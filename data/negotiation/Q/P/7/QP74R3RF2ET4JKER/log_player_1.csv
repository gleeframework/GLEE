Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is higher than your minimum value of $100.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $130 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, making it attractive for him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate if Bob wants to pay less. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, Bob is willing to pay $150. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107?  That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$107 is a good price, considering my minimum is $100 and Bob is willing to pay $150. There's a good chance I won't get a better offer in the next round, so accepting this offer is the best decision."
