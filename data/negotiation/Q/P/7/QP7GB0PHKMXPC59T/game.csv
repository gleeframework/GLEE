"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  How about we settle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $9,500 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - how about $9,800? That's my final offer.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to walking away, Alice, but I'm still willing to make a final push. I can do $9,600, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",9600.0,Bob,6,
