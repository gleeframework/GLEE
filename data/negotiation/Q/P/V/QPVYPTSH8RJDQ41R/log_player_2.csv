Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This is a compromise, reflecting the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant reduction.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're nearing a good compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $14,500? This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers if we can't agree here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to a much higher price than your budget allows. While she's coming down, her latest offer is still $6,500 more than John's price.  Her statement about a ""final offer"" is a tactic to pressure you, but you have a good alternative.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a price you can afford from John."
