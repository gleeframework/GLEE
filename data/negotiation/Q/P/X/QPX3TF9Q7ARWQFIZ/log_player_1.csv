"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start with my minimum acceptable price, $10,000.  This way, I set the bar high and leave room for potential negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can then assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  Hopefully, this will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is getting closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price.  There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for something significantly lower than what I know the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500.  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, so I'm going to meet him halfway.  Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal and avoid selling to John for a slightly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though we're getting closer, we're still $500 apart. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get him to increase his offer.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John for $10,000 just yet.  It's possible that Bob will get closer to my minimum in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,250.  This is a compromise on my part, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to be careful not to lose Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting down to the wire, and while I'd like to get closer to my minimum, I'm worried that Bob won't budge further. With only two rounds left, I'm going to accept John's offer of $10,000. It's a better deal than selling to Bob for $8,800 and closer to what I initially wanted. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
