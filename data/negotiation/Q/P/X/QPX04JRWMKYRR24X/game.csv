"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $155. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",155.0,Alice,5,
