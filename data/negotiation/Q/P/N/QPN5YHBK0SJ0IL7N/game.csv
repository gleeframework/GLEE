"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000 for your product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,600,000. This gives you a substantial discount from my original offer and still allows me to achieve a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer of $1,600,000, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is within the range you're considering and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
