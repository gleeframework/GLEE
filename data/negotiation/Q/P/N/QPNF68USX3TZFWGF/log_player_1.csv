Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why not $1,500,000?**  While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, it's unlikely he'll be willing to pay that much right away. There's always room for negotiation.
* **Why $1,400,000?** This is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what I would get from John, but it still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If Bob is serious about buying, he's likely to counteroffer, and we can then negotiate from there."
