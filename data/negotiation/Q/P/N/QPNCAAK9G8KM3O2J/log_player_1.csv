# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer works for you.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $13,200.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with a price of $13,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing a sale and having to sell to John for a lower price."
