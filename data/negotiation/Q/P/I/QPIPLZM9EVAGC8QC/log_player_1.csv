Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,400,000?**  This price is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000), making it attractive to him, but still significantly less than my floor price ($1,500,000), meaning I still make a good profit.
* **The message:** I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a good deal while also reminding him of the value of the product. 

**Important Note:** This strategy relies on the assumption that Bob is motivated to get a good deal and will be willing to pay more than his initial valuation if it means he can get the product."
