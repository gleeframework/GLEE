Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. It's more advantageous to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk losing out entirely with Bob."
