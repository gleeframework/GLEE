Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive message:** I'm being positive and framing it as a good deal for both of us, which could encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a successful sale!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,000 is a good price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not quite there:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob clearly wants the product. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John would guarantee $8,000, but I'd rather see if I can get closer to $10,000 by continuing with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* **I will send Bob a counteroffer.** I want to try and meet him halfway, but I'm not going to drop my price too far below $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little to $9,500.  It's still a great price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a reasonable price:**  This price still ensures I make a profit and am not selling too far below my minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing that this offer is good for both of us. This could help convince Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider if I want to continue negotiating with Bob or if I should sell to John for $8,000."
