"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $10,000 is a good price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little to $9,500.  It's still a great price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.**  The $9,500 price is lower than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **There's little room for further negotiation.**  Alice has already come down from her initial offer. Trying to negotiate further might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Accepting the offer is the most financially advantageous.**  It saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John, and it avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
