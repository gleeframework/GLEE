{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  It leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's worth.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:**  You're in a good position. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get closer to your desired price.
* **You want to see if Bob is willing to go higher:**  Rejecting his offer allows you to test his commitment and see if he's genuinely interested in the product.

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your initial offer but still above his counteroffer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but also maintains your position of strength."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though. How about we settle on $1,425,000? It's a fair price that bridges the gap between our offers."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It's still above Bob's offer, showing you're not desperate for a deal. 
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  This counteroffer will give you a clearer idea of how committed Bob is to buying the product at a price closer to your desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,425,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000 again. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has made the same counteroffer twice. This suggests he's not willing to budge further. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John. 
* **Securing the guaranteed deal:**  John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is close to your minimum and provides a safe and reliable outcome. 

While you might be able to negotiate further with Bob, the risk of a protracted negotiation outweighs the potential gains. Selling to John now is the most sensible decision."
