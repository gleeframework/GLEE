"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're serious about the negotiation but won't accept unreasonable prices. You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I would be willing to consider a price closer to  $850,000."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. I believe the value this product brings is significantly higher than what you're currently proposing. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still much higher than your target. You'll continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but there's still a significant gap between our positions.  I'm serious about finding a fair price, but $1,900,000 is simply not feasible.  To be frank, my upper limit is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider an offer in the range of $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident it represents the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but the price is still far too high. It's time to show that you're willing to walk away if necessary. By rejecting this offer, you emphasize the seriousness of your budget constraints and push Alice to make a more realistic proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a long way from what I can justify.  At this point, I need to see a more substantial movement on price to continue this negotiation. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I want to be sure we've explored all options before making a final decision. You're right that there's a gap, but I want you to consider the bigger picture. This product has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and an investment of $1,500,000 is a small price to pay for the value it will bring. That's my firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price you're willing to pay.  She's holding firm at $1,500,000, which is too high. You've been clear about your budget, and further negotiation seems unproductive. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000."
