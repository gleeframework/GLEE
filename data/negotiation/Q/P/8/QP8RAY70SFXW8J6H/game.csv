"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from our last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1200000, so I'd like to propose a price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
