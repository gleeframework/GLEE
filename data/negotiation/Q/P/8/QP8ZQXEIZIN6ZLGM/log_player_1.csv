Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Markup:** The offer of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price.  This significant increase aims to maximize potential profit while still being within a reasonable range for a product Bob himself values at $1,500,000.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in discussion. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knew your bottom line, your negotiating power would be significantly reduced."
