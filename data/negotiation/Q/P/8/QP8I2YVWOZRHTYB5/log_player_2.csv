"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You can still buy from John if the negotiations fail."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I value this product highly, I could come down to $90 for you. This is my final offer.

While you'd prefer a lower price, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Accepting for $90 is still a better deal than buying from John for $100."
