"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I know holds significant value for your business.  I'm confident it will greatly benefit you.  My initial offer is $950,000.  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's keep working together. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful outcome for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $875,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we're both seeing in this product. Let's close this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference one more time and settle at $881,250? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.",881250.0,Bob,6,
