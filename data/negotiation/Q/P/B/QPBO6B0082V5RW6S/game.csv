"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $95, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal.",92.5,Bob,4,
