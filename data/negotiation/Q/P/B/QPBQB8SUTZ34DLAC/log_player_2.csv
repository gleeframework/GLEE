"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

Reasoning: Starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) allows for negotiation room while still remaining significantly below Alice's asking price and John's alternative offer. This approach aims to maximize potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: While $130 is closer to our budget, there's still room for negotiation. We'll counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Reasoning: By suggesting $120, we're splitting the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below John's alternative."
