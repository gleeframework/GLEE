"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you, and it leaves room for us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is closer to your offer and still reflects the value of the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and do $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
