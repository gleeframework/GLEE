"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer leaves enough room for counteroffers and negotiations within the 10 rounds. 

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping John's $15,000 offer in mind. If negotiations with Bob stall or go below $13,000, I'll be prepared to switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than the value Bob himself places on the product. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm not ready to sell just yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you, and it leaves room for us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm countering with a specific price, $11,000, and providing a reason for this price: ""meeting in the middle.""  
* **Highlighting Value and Fairness:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more to him than $9,000 and that $11,000 is a fair compromise. 
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Room for Flexibility:** While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it still leaves room for Bob to counter if necessary. I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I'm starting to close the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $9,500 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my desired price and even below the value Bob himself places on the product. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I still have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can continue to negotiate a better price with Bob.  
* **John's offer as a backup:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is closer to your offer and still reflects the value of the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down to $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but not willing to settle for a price too far below my value.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing my offer as a win-win scenario where both of us get what we want.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $10,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer, I still have room to negotiate in the next few rounds if needed.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and do $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $10,500. This indicates we are nearing a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be mindful of the time constraint. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** While $10,000 is less than what John is offering, it's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely and being stuck with John's offer. 

It's a risk to accept, but I believe it's a calculated risk.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure a deal and avoid the potential of losing out entirely."
