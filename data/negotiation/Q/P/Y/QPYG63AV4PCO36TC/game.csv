,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the value of the product, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This is a fair price, considering we are both looking to make a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I can offer it to you for $9,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still aiming for a lower price point, but I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's close this deal at a price that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",10250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I believe we're very close to a deal.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I place on this product: $9,750. This price is fair for both of us, and if we don't reach an agreement now, I'll have to explore other options. ",9750.0,Bob,10,
