"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. While $750,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $875,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures you receive this incredible product at a price that benefits us both.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. However, I am still looking to keep my investment lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget while still securing a valuable asset.",800000.0,Bob,4,
