"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, we're offering it to you for $12000. This price reflects the quality of the product and the opportunity it presents for you. We believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation is the best strategy for Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to work within them. In light of that, I would like to offer you the product for $11000. This price still reflects the quality and value of the product while being more accessible to your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $10,000. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to walk away, so he should continue to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. As I mentioned before, my budget is $10,000.  I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my willingness to buy it immediately.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your commitment to purchasing the product and the value you place on it, I am willing to offer the product to you for $10500. This price reflects the balance between the product's value and your budget, aiming for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is tempting, as it's only $500 over Bob's budget. However, Bob has consistently maintained his $10,000 limit and has demonstrated a willingness to walk away.  Continuing to push for that price could result in a successful deal or at least get Alice closer to Bob's desired price.  There are still rounds left, and Bob can always opt to buy from John if the negotiation fails."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
