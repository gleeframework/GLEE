Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 140}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $130 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135?  This is a fair price that both of us can agree on. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $135. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $132 is not ideal, it's only $3 below my minimum acceptable price and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
