{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's a real steal, considering its value!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, aiming to get the best possible deal. It also uses positive language and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't accept this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than $10,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me keep the value of the product close to what it's worth to me. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
