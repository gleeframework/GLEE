I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price, giving me room to negotiate.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to see if he's interested in this price or if he's going to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I think there's still some room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this shows him that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to accept John's offer of $15,000.  It's my minimum price, and it guarantees a sale.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point."
