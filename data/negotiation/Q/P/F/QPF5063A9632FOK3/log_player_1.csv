"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to maximize my earnings.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal of $150. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still too low.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125.  This price gives us both a fair deal, and we can finally close this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm also emphasizing the idea of a ""fair deal"" and a quick close to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $120?  This price allows us both to walk away with a good deal and avoid further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell. I believe I can get a better price with more negotiation, and I haven't yet reached the point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $122. This is a small compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's end this negotiation and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm making a small concession but still staying above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the idea of a quick close to encourage Bob to accept."
