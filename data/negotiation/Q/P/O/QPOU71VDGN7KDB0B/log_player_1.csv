I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a more reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial low offer. I hope this will entice him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value.  While I'd like to get a higher price, it's clear that he's not willing to meet my expectations.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially lose more money, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it guarantees I reach my minimum target."
