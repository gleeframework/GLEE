Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a great deal and you'll benefit from its use."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

Reasoning:

* **Starting High:** Aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason, even a simple one, can make the offer feel more considered and appealing.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message doesn't pressure Bob into an immediate ""yes"" or ""no,"" encouraging a counteroffer if he finds the initial price too high. 

This strategy balances ambition with the knowledge that we have a $100 backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is tempting, we're still aiming to maximize profit. We know he values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation. Accepting his first counteroffer might leave money on the table. We'll try a counteroffer to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  How about we settle on $110? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility but holding firm on a price above our minimum.
* **Framing as a Compromise:** By presenting $110 as a compromise, we nudge Bob towards accepting rather than countering again.
* **Clear and Simple:** The message is straightforward, focusing on finding an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could likely negotiate a slightly higher price, the gains would be minimal. Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity, and further haggling might lead to him walking away.

* **Opportunity Cost:**  Our time is valuable. Accepting $107.50 now allows us to move on to other potential deals.

* **Profitable Outcome:** We're still securing a $7.50 profit above our minimum selling price to John. This outcome represents a good balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
