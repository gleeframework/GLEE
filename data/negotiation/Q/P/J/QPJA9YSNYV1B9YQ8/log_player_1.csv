Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, hoping to entice him to pay more.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message leaves room for counteroffers and further negotiation, allowing me to potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup, ensuring I have a guaranteed sale for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than what the product is worth to him. While I could accept it and get some money, it's not a good deal for me.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $9,500. This keeps the negotiations open and gives me a better chance of getting a more favorable price.  

It's also important to remember that John is a reliable alternative for a $10,000 sale.  This option keeps me from settling for a bad deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for the quality and benefits you'll get.  Let's work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above what the product is worth to him. 
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Maintain negotiation:**  I'm keeping the negotiation open and leaving room for further discussion.
* **Plan B:** I'm still aware of John as a backup option, giving me confidence to hold firm on a price that's more beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a bit of a budget. I could go up to $7,500.  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still significantly below my desired price and even below what the product is worth to him.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is likely to lead to a lower price and consume valuable time.  I have a reliable backup option with John, who is willing to pay my asking price of $10,000.  It's more profitable and efficient to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
