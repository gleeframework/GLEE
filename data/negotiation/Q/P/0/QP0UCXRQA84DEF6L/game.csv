"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've learned about your interest in it. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer of $750,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $795,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $775,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I can offer it to you for $790,000, which is just $10,000 more than your last offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,
