"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's initial offer.  The product is only worth $800,000 to him, and Alice's offer is $100,000 higher than that. There's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a counteroffer that is $150,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've learned about your interest in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer of $750,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $795,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $775,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

Bob is making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's offer, but still below his target of $750,000.  He's showing that he's willing to compromise, but still pushing for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I can offer it to you for $790,000, which is just $10,000 more than your last offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  He's only got three rounds left, and Alice is clearly not willing to go down to his target price.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at his maximum price point, and it saves him from further negotiation."
