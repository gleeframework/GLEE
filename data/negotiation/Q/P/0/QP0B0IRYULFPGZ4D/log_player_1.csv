"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation. It's important to note that I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum value, but I also want to be competitive and avoid scaring Bob away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see what he counters with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is still significantly higher than my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully incentivizes Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite where I want it to be. I have several rounds left and I believe there's potential for a higher offer. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm continuing to negotiate by lowering my offer slightly, to $1,300,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still remaining above my minimum value. My hope is that Bob will see this as a compromise and be more willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are at round 6, and Bob is still only willing to pay my minimum value of $1,200,000. I've already had to lower my offer significantly, and I'm starting to lose hope that I can get more from Bob.  Rather than risk going through more rounds with Bob and potentially ending up with the same price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
