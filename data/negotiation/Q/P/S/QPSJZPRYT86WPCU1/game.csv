"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $950,000 for the product. This price would allow me to make a good profit, and I believe it's fair considering your desired sale price. I hope you'll consider my counteroffer.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price will still allow you to make a good profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product.  This offer is closer to your desired price and allows me to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,030,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
