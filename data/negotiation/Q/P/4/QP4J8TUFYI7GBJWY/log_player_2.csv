Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay $12000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13500. Let me know if that works for you!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a free upgrade and a 1-year warranty. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even with the free upgrade and warranty, the price from Alice is still higher than John's. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the best option."
