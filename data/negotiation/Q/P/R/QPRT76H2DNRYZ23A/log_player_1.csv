Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""good deal"" for Bob. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is already a good deal for Bob, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if he tries to counter-offer."
