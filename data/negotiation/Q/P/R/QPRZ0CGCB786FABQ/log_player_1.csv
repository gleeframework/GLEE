Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,550,000 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much more out of him.  It's also slightly better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
