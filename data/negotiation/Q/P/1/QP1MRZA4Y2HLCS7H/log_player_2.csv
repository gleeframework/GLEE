"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still above his ideal price point.  He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering and seeing if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm really looking to stay under $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $9,750? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, $9,750 is still above his target.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  There are still several rounds to go, and he doesn't want to be pressured into accepting a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for me.  Let's try $9,500. I think this is a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $9,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected this offer once in round 3. Alice is not budging on her price, and Bob's goal is to save money. It's clear that Alice is not going to go lower than $9,750. In this situation, it's more financially beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000.  He is still within his budget and avoiding a lengthy negotiation that may not result in a lower price."
