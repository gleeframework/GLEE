"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm really looking to stay under $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $9,750? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for me.  Let's try $9,500. I think this is a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling happy with the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $9,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9750.0,Alice,5,
