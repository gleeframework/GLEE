Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's a significant markup from his perceived value ($10,000) but potentially appealing if the product is truly valuable to him.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or you might end up selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
