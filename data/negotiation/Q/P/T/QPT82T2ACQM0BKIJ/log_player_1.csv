Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $14,000. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation of $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, increasing your profit. 
* **Secure the Sale:** While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. Selling to John guarantees you $12,000, but selling to Bob at $14,000 is a better outcome.

This strategy balances risk and reward to maximize your potential earnings."
