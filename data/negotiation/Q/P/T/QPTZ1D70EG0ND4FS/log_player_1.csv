"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a fair price for Bob to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 9 rounds left to potentially reach a better deal with Bob, or I can sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my minimum, I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with him yet. There's still a chance we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'll continue to try and negotiate in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $10,000 offer. While that's not workable for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $11,000.  This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and it's the closest I can come without jeopardizing my own financial goals. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in trying to meet my budget. However, I'm still unable to go beyond $10,000 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been consistent in his offer, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  I've made significant concessions, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, it's best to secure the $15,000 sale with John."
