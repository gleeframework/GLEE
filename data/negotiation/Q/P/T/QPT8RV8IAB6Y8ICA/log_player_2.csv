(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,750 is a good compromise, only $250 more than my last counteroffer.
* **Strategy:**  At this point, it's better to accept and secure the product than risk further negotiation.  There's always the possibility of a last-minute snag, and buying from John would be significantly more expensive. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll accept Alice's offer and finalize the purchase."
