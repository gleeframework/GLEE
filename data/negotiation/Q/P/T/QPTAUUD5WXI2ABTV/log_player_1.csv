Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise that benefits both parties while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $8,000 from John, it's still lower than the $12,000 you offered initially. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get closer to your desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
