Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's ambitious:**  You're aiming for a good chunk of the potential surplus value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your desired price:** While it's above your minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than the $950,000 you initially offered.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob clearly wants the product and is willing to pay above your minimum.  
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** You can always sell to John for $800,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting a subpar offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and can potentially secure a higher price in the next round."

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a strong compromise and signals a willingness to come to an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your desired price:** Bob's offer of $885,000 is significantly closer to your desired price than your initial offer of $950,000.
* **Negotiation is at a standstill:**  It's likely that further negotiations will result in small incremental changes, making it more likely to reach a stalemate. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Bob altogether.

This is a good deal considering the negotiations and the risk of selling to John for a lower price. It's time to close the deal."
