,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. Would you be open to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer of $125, Bob, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, $135 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $130 -  that's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to give up yet, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $132.50?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm willing to go up to $131.50, but that's really my limit.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",131.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $131, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to make this deal happen.",131.0,Alice,7,
