"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to offer $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your sticking to your valuation, but I need to be closer to my minimum for this to make sense.  How about we settle this right now at $13,000?  That's a significant price drop, and shows how serious I am about working with you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,
