Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to take another step closer and offer $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at that price. It makes more sense to cut your losses and secure the product from John for the best price."
