"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to take another step closer and offer $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
