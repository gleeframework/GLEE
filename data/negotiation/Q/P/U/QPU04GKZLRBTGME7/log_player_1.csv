{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $130 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him room to potentially negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This price gives you some flexibility if Bob wants to negotiate lower. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is better than selling to John,  I'd like to try and get closer to my original price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product!  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
