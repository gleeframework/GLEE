"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This offer still reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
