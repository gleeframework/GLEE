"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $12,500. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $13,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000.  You're running out of rounds and it's clear she's holding firm closer to her desired price. To ensure you stay within your $8,000 budget, it's time to cut negotiations with Alice and take John's offer."
