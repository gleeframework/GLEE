"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is high-quality, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $12,500. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price, how about $11,000? I feel this is a fair compromise, and we can hopefully close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $13,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,7,
