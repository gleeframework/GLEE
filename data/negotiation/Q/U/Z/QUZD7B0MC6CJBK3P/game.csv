"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my valuation. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your valuation, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's find a way to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that still reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget. If you're serious about selling, this is our best chance to make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
