"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is worth it:**  Since Bob's maximum is $1,000,000 and Alice's minimum is likely around $800,000, there's room for negotiation.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $875000. This price still reflects a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable:**  It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not budge much lower.  She's already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might walk away, and Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product for a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
