Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than John's offer:** This gives you a better return than selling to John.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** This makes it appealing to Bob, as he'll still get a good deal. 

This strategy increases the chance of Bob accepting, while still leaving some room for negotiation if he wants to try for a lower price."
