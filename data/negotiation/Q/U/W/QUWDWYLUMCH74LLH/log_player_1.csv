Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to be flexible on the price to make this a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,300,000. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I will not accept his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $950,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still below my acceptable threshold. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I will not accept his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  I'm prepared to lower my price a bit more, but only to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $1,025,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I will not accept his current offer.  I'm not willing to risk selling to John for $1,500,000 yet, as I believe I can still get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,037,500.

While Bob is getting closer,  $1,012,500 is still too low for me to consider. I'm not willing to risk selling to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter again to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,012,500 is still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.

Bob's offer:

It's down to the wire, and while Bob's offer is close, it's still not enough to meet my minimum acceptable price.  I've been negotiating in good faith, but I'm not willing to compromise further.  With only one round left, it's better to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,500,000."
