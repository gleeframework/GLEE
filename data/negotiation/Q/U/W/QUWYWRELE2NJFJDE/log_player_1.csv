Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price higher than that, leaving room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives value beyond his initial assessment.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The price of $125 is strategically placed above Bob's perceived value but below John's guaranteed purchase price. This maximizes the potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message uses positive language (""special price,"" ""great deal"") to make the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a profit above Bob's valuation while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
