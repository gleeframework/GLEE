Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so any offer below this will likely be accepted, but it's not maximizing your potential profit.
* **John as a Guarantee:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation.

**Why this strategy works:**

This strategy creates a win-win situation while leaning towards your advantage:

* **Bob:** Potentially gets the product for $300,000 less than its perceived value to him.
* **You (Alice):**  Secure a profit of $100,000 more than what Bob values the product for. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still likely to get a better price than selling directly to John."
