"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I can likely get more by continuing the negotiation, especially since I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $1,120,000? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with that. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have 6 rounds left and the potential to reach a better agreement. Selling to John at this point would be a loss compared to what I'm likely to get from Bob in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,060,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $1,040,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000.  I only have 4 rounds left and the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob is that I might end up with a lower offer or no deal at all."
