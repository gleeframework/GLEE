"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant value and potential this product holds. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of this product, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is too low to justify parting with this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $2,000,000? This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my goal is to achieve a fair deal that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a compelling opportunity for you to acquire a truly exceptional asset.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,900,000 is still outside my comfortable price range. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,750,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this asset and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
