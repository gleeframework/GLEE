Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is too low to justify parting with this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $2,000,000? This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my goal is to achieve a fair deal that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000.
