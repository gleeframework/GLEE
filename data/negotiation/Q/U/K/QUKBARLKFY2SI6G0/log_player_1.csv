"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($100) but still below what it's worth to me ($150). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **10 Rounds:** I have plenty of rounds to adjust my price if needed. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my starting price and closer to his own value of the product. It's a risky move to accept this, considering the product is worth more to me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 8 rounds left. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a secure $150, I'm not desperate. There's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than $120 but lower than my initial $175."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counter-offering at $150, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $150 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared for further negotiation if needed. I'll continue to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $125 is still below my personal value of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still have 6 rounds remaining. I'm confident I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm hoping to maximize my profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to $125 but still above my minimum. My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($150) and Bob's latest offer ($125). This shows a genuine willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""walk away satisfied"" to emphasize the benefits of accepting this offer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's getting closer to Bob's value.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by emphasizing the need for a compromise. This could encourage Bob to accept the offer before it's too late.

**Next Steps:** 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider my options more carefully. I have 5 rounds left, and I need to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should accept John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do a bit better than $135. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price, and I could end up with nothing if Bob continues to reject my offers.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, I need to weigh the certainty of $130 now against the potential (but uncertain) chance of a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **Time Value of Money:** It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal entirely and having to start over with another buyer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
