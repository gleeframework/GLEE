"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low. How about $11500? It's still a great price for the product, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11000. If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
