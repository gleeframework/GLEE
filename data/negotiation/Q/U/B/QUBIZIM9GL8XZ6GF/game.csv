"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1250000. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value of this unique product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1250000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1750000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your compromise, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a fair price considering my limit and the value of the product. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1400000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1600000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.
