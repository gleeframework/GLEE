{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer. $175 is too high, and I can get it from John for $150. I'll try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $155 is still a bit high, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to get to a price that works for both of us. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'm willing to go up to $145.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  How about $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $150 is fair, but I've already decided that I'm willing to pay $150 to John. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice.  I'm going to buy the product from John."
