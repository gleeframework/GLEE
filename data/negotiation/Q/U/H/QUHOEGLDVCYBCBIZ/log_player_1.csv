Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150) leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price agreeable to both parties. 
* **Maintain a Margin:** Even if Bob negotiates down, starting at $175 ensures Alice still earns a profit above her minimum acceptable price ($150).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
