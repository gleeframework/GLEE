Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also reflects that I value the product at more than $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering at $175. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but also won't scare him off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price for me. I will reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm dropping the price to $125. This is a further compromise, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than selling to John for $150. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that he's getting a good deal at this price."
