"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, increasing your chances of getting the product for closer to Alice's $12,000 valuation."
