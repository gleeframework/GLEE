Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering it for $14,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's likely willing to pay a price higher than my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price.
* **Psychology:** A price slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value ($15,000) can make the offer seem more appealing and increase the chances of acceptance."
