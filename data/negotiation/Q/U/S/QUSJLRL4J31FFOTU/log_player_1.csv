"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to sell the product for $9,000, as it is worth less than what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,400. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10400}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10200. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm not confident I can reach an agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price, and it's worth it to me to avoid further negotiation."
