Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The $120 offer allows for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $80 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $100 is more than my floor of $80, so I don't need to immediately accept. 
* **Room for improvement:** There's potential to get a better price. I can try to push for something closer to my initial offer of $120. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate and keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at more than $100, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $110 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing that the product is worth more than $100, but I'm open to a reasonable compromise. This underscores the product's value and potentially encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in entirely. This keeps the leverage in my favor and potentially leads to a better outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still hoping to keep the price closer to $100 if possible. Could we perhaps aim for $105? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my initial goal of $120 and significantly higher than John's offer of $80. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, there's no guarantee he'll budge further. Accepting his offer minimizes risk and ensures I get a good price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to Bob walking away, leaving me with the lower offer from John.  Accepting now is the most efficient way to secure a good deal."
