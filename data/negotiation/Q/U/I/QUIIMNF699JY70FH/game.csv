"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $160. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $155. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $15!",155.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $152. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $2!",152.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I think we're getting a bit repetitive here. I'm not willing to go down to $140, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm going to meet you at $150, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're at your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and my original offer of $120, which is $135. Would you be willing to accept that?",135.0,Bob,10,
