Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open the offer to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below your minimum allows Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $1,200,000.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other potential buyers incentivizes Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the security of your fallback offer from John."
