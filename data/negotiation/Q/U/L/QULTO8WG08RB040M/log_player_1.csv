"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting price:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, aiming to maximize my potential profit.
* **Open to negotiation:**  This signals my willingness to compromise, making Bob feel like he has room to negotiate. 
* **Value proposition:** I mention the product's value to Bob, subtly implying it's worth the asking price.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping the negotiation open. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the round number, always keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or if not, I can always sell to John for the same amount.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  Let's try $1,100,000. This allows me to come down a bit from my initial price while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Open-ended question:** I end with a question to encourage further discussion and keep the negotiation alive.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping my price above my minimum threshold. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, but I'm also being flexible to keep Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  Given the limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer makes sense. I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, but this offer is slightly better.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether."
