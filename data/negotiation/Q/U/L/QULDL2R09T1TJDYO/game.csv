"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $135? It's a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your revised offer, but I think $125 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",130.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with $130. Would you be willing to go down to $127?,127.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting a bit tired of going back and forth, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $131? It's a good price, and I'm willing to call it a day at this point.",131.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to go above $129. I think that's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",129.0,Bob,10,
