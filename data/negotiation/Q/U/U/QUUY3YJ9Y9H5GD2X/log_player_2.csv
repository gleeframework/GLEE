"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs in [mention relevant area where the product benefits Bob]. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth significantly less to her ($800,000). By rejecting this initial offer, you open the door for a counter-offer closer to Alice's actual valuation."
