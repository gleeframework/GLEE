{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $10,000, but I'm also aware that Bob values the product less.  $9,500 leaves some room for negotiation, but still gives me a decent profit.  I'll be prepared to counter-offer if needed, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it agreeable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
