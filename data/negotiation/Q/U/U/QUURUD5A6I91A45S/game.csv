"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
