"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I'm personally asking $12,000 for.  I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, so it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fantastic price.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is within your budget of $15,000 and allows you to save $3,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, it's likely she won't go lower than her desired $10,000.  Accepting her offer is the best way to secure the product while saving money."
