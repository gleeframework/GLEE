"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value this product can bring to your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $2,000,000, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
