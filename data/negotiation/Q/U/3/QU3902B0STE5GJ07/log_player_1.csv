Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value this product can bring to your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $2,000,000, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

At this point, Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate him higher, and John offers the same amount. It's best to take the sure thing now."
