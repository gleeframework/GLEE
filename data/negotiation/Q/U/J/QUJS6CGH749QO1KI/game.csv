"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $112.50. I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?,108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $110. How about we meet at $107? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.0,Bob,6,
