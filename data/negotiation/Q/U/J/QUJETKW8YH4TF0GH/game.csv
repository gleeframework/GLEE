"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, your initial price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our positions.  To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider a figure in that range?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still quite a ways apart on our valuations.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, I need to be realistic about the value this product represents.  I can bridge the gap some, but not to the extent you're suggesting. I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a significant concession on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this done.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still difficult for me to justify. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $800,000. I'd much rather work with you, but I need this deal to make financial sense.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
