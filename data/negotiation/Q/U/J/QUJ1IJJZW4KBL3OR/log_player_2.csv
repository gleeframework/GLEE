"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will help you achieve your goals. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a smart investment.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $850,000. That's $50,000 more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject Alice's offer and look for a better deal.
