"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,350,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $1,200,000.  He's offering $1,250,000, a significant drop from Alice's offer. This shows he's serious about getting a deal but is still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher than her initial offer.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and can likely get a better price if he continues to push for a lower price. He has 7 rounds left and can still potentially save more money by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is inching closer to his goal price.  He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still $25,000 below Alice's counteroffer, leaving room for negotiation while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is now significantly higher than Bob's desired price.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with.  There's a risk that if Bob continues to reject and counteroffer, Alice could push the price even higher. 

Given that Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,200,000, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of a further price increase from Alice."
