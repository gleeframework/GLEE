Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $150.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm prepared to go lower if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell at that price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $175.  This is still a good profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up from his initial $150 offer, and $160 is a good price that I can accept. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm happy to sell to Bob at $160."
