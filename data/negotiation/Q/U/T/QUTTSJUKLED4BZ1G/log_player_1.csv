Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $100 is more than Bob's $80 valuation, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your $120 minimum, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Both of you have room to compromise.

By offering a price that's not too high, you increase the chances of Bob accepting your initial offer, saving time and effort. If Bob rejects, you're ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. You'll need to be careful to not push Bob away with a too-high counteroffer, but you can potentially secure a deal closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and yours.  How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
