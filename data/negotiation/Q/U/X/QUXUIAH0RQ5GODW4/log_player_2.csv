# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time deal for you. I'll sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way too high! It's much more than you're willing to pay and even more than Alice values it. You're better off going with John's offer of $8,000."
