Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $170. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, setting the initial price slightly above that might pique his interest and make him consider it if he perceives the value differently. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  The price is still significantly lower than what John is willing to pay, ensuring you're making a profit regardless of Bob's decision.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below $150 to ensure you meet your minimum."
