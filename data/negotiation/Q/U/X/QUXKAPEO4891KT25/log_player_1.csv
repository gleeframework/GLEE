Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($800,000) will net a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,300,000 is:
    * Significantly below John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
    * Considerably above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize Alice's profit.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message positions the product's value and proposes the price confidently without revealing desperation for a sale. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing the potential earnings for Alice."
