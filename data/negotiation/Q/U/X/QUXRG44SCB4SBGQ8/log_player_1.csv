Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate and hopefully avoids an immediate rejection. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** My message emphasizes that this is a good deal for both of us. This can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating, but the initial offer sets a strong starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal!
* If the negotiations stall, I'll have the option to switch to John, guaranteeing me my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial value of $800,000. This suggests there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a higher price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but still acknowledging his willingness to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference at $875,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying close to my desired value.
* **Reiterate mutual benefit:**  My message again emphasizes finding a ""fair price for both of us."" This keeps the focus on collaboration and encourages a positive negotiation.
* **Keep the door open:** I'm not rigidly sticking to my minimum value.  This flexibility increases the chances of reaching an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he rejects, I'll weigh my options:  continue negotiating with Bob, or sell to John.
* If he accepts, I've achieved a good outcome!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has returned to his original offer of $850,000, indicating he's unwilling to budge significantly. 
* **Close to my minimum:**  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000 than his initial $800,000, it's still not acceptable to me. 
* **Guaranteed value with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable value and exceeds Bob's final offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll politely decline Bob's final offer and move forward with selling the product to John to secure my minimum desired value."
