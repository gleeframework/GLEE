"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,500,000 is outside my price range. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a substantial gap from what I have in mind.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind and will generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's potential, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still above my limit. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  My final offer is $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and the significant investment I'm willing to make. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
