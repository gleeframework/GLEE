"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000.  This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
