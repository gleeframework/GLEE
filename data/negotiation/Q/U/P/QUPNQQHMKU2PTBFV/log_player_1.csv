Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum price of $10,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product without being unreasonable.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room to negotiate downwards while still achieving a good deal.  It's also important to be friendly and encouraging in your message to foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good price while ensuring I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** $9,000 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Show flexibility:**  By lowering my price, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and aim to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. This would allow both of us to come away with a fair deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Further negotiation with Bob may take more time and energy, and there's no guarantee we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more efficient and profitable to sell to John. I can avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation and secure a higher price."
