"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good price while ensuring I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. This would allow both of us to come away with a fair deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
