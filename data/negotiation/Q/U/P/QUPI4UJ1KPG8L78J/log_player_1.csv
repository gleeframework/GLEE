{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from my minimum value while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  It also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong opening position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1 million. I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum value.  Considering Bob's willingness to compromise and the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy, accepting his offer is the most strategic decision.  I can always try to negotiate a higher price on future deals with Bob."
