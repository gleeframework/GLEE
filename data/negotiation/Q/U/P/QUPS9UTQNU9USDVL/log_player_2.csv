# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  A counteroffer will give you the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's still room to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  A counteroffer might lead to a better deal for you."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $975,000 is close, but I need to be at least at $990,000 to make this worthwhile for me. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $990,000 is a good deal for you.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, but Alice is offering it for $10,000 less.  This is a fair compromise, and you'd be saving money by accepting it."
