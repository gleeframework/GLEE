Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's still lower than my minimum threshold of $80. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm offering the product to Bob for $100.  This is a reasonable price for both of us, considering the value to Bob and my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than I'd like, it's above my minimum threshold of $80, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a risk that Bob might get tired of the back-and-forth and decide to walk away, or that I might not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the deal at this point."
