"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. While $800,000 is tempting, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable meeting you halfway just yet. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is getting closer to my goal, but I'm still a bit off.  I'm going to offer $925,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the higher end of the price spectrum just yet. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $975,000. This is a small step back from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
