Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. While $800,000 is tempting, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential for both of us.
