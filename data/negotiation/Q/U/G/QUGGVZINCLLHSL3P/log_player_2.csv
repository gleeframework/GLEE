"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.
* **You have 10 rounds.** There's room for negotiation to try and get closer to Alice's valuation. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  You know you can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no pressure to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This would be a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is significantly lower:** This shows you're serious about negotiating and are willing to start at a lower point.
* **Offer is still within your budget:**  You're leaving some room to potentially negotiate higher if needed.
* **Reasoning is provided:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're explaining your logic to help build trust and encourage further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I believe my initial offer was reflective of that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target:** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You've made some progress, and you have more rounds to continue pushing for a better price.
* **John's offer provides a fallback:** You can always buy from John if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially get even closer to your target price."

Round 4
