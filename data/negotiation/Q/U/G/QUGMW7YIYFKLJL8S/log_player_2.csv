"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $1,000,000, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his ""walk-away"" price of $1,500,000. While Bob could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away and Bob needing to buy from John makes accepting the offer the best strategy."
