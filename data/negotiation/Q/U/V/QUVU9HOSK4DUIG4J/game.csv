"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to consider your needs. My initial price is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $900,000? Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $700,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
