"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and it reflects the value I know this product holds.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a decent profit.",13500.0,Bob,4,
