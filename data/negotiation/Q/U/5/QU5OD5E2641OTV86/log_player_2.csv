"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I suggest we start our negotiation with a price of $140. This reflects the product's worth to both of us and allows for a fair transaction. Please let me know if this proposal suits your expectations, or if you'd like to discuss other terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer of $140 is too high. While it leaves some room for negotiation, there's a good chance you can get a better price by:

* **Counter-offering:**  You could propose a lower price, closer to $120. Alice might be willing to come down, especially if she's motivated to sell.
* **Waiting for a better offer:**  If Alice is eager to sell, she might make a lower offer if you initially reject her first one.

By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a better deal without immediately resorting to buying from John at the highest price."
