"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for moving on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $1,100,000. I'm confident that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
