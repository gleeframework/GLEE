"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a simple decision. Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and Alice's own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A significantly lower counter-offer puts the pressure on Alice and establishes a strong negotiating position for yourself. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** A $1,000,000 counter-offer allows ample space to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $1,200,000 limit. 
* **Encouraging Dialogue:** The message is polite and encourages Alice to continue the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's counter-offer of $1,350,000 remains above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to your range, the gap suggests there's still room for her to come down further. 
* **John as Leverage:** Having John's offer in your back pocket gives you leverage to walk away if Alice doesn't meet your price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for moving on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $1,100,000. I'm confident that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** By increasing your offer to $1,100,000, you demonstrate your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Staying Below Limit:**  Your counter-offer remains safely below your $1,200,000 limit, preserving your negotiating position.
* **Justification and Urgency:**  The message highlights the fairness of your offer and subtly conveys a sense of urgency to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but I have to be mindful of the product's value. Would you consider $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's latest offer of $1,250,000 is still above your strict $1,200,000 budget. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her increasing the price again or reaching an impasse. The potential savings from haggling further are minimal compared to the guaranteed price from John.
* **John's Offer is Solid:** You have a reliable alternative in John, who is offering the product at your exact maximum budget."
