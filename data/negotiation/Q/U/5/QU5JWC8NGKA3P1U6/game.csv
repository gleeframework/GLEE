"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it can significantly benefit your portfolio.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This is my best offer and a significant reduction, demonstrating my commitment to making this deal work.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, and I believe this price is more reasonable given the product's value.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. It seems we both see value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $2,000,000. This offer takes into account our previous discussions and represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let's get this done - what do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,850,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I've already made significant concessions to reach a fair deal. This is my final offer: $1,950,000.  I need a decision today, otherwise, I need to move on to other interested parties.  This is your chance to acquire a truly unique product.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
