{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is above my minimum but allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it shows he's interested, it's not worth accepting at this point. I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a lower price just yet. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you'd be interested in that."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $13,000 is halfway between my initial price of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my price is still reasonable.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  My message leaves room for Bob to counter again if he's not satisfied, but it also shows I'm serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $12,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he still refuses, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $12,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product well worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This counteroffer is my absolute minimum price, reflecting my desire to close the deal while still maintaining a decent profit.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I frame this offer as fair for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Positive Incentive:** I remind Bob of the product's value and encourage him to invest. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will move forward with selling to John for $12,000, as it's no longer worth further negotiation."
