"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to counteroffer if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm still confident that this price is fair, given the value of the product to him."
