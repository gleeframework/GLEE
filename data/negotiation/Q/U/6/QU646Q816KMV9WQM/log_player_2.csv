{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. This is a good deal, but I can likely get it for less. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85 for the product. This is a fair price considering Alice values it at $80 and I'm willing to pay up to $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within my budget and a better deal than John's offer. I'll accept the offer and buy the product."
