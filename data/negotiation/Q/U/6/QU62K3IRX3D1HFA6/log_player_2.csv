"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than the price he can get from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.

* **Setting the Stage:** By offering a specific price, Bob avoids a drawn-out negotiation and signals his seriousness about making a deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1325000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** Bob offers a price that is closer to Alice's counteroffer, showing a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
