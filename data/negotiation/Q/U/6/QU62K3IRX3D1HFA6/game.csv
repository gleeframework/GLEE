"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $1250000.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1325000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1325000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to pay $1300000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1320000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still locked in at my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1280000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
