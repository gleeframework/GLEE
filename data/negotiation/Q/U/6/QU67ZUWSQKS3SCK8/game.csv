"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're holding firm on the value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a win-win,  allowing you a good price and me a great deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
