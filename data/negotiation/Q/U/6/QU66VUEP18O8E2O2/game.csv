"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $105. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you showing interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about $110? That's a fair price, and it gives you a good deal on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $107.50 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $109. This is a great deal for you, and it's also a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $108.50. That's the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",108.5,Bob,6,
