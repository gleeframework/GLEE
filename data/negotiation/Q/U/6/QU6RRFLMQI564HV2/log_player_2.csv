{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to negotiate, especially when you have a backup option like John.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price.  $800,000 is still a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Let's keep negotiating.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}

I'm going to split the difference and offer $825,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to get a price that's closer to my target."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the negotiations.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, it's not worth risking losing the deal.  $835,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to accept."
