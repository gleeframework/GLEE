"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation as Alice is willing to sell for less than Bob's maximum price.
* **Time to counter:** Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Setting a clear price:** By stating a specific price, Bob establishes his starting point and avoids ambiguity.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counter is still too high:** While closer to Bob's desired price, $11,500 is still above his comfort zone.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's room to push for a lower price, as Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and get this deal done. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  This counteroffer only slightly lowers Alice's price, signaling that Bob is serious about buying but still looking for a better deal. 
* **Focusing on fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair price for both of us"" encourages cooperation and reinforces Bob's reasonable stance.
* **Creating urgency:**  The phrase ""get this deal done"" suggests that Bob is ready to close the deal if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
