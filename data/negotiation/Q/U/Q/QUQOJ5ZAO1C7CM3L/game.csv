"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still working with a tight budget. I'd be happy to pay $11,000, which would give you a good profit. How does that sound?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $11,750.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $11,750 is tempting, I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $11,250? That's a fair compromise and would allow us to make this deal work.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued negotiation, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $11,500, which is the same price I offered in round 3. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",11500.0,Alice,7,
