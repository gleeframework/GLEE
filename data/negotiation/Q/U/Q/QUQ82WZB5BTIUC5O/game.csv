"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",170.0,Alice,1,

"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $170 and $130. I'm offering you the product for $145. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $137.50. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you the product for $142. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $5.",142.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $142. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept that price?",140.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you the product for $147. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $7.",147.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really not willing to go above $140. I'm willing to make a final offer of $140, and if you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $120. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a decision soon.",140.0,Bob,8,
