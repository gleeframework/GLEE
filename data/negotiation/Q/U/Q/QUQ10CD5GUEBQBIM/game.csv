"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I can't go as low as $11,500.  Would you be willing to do $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
