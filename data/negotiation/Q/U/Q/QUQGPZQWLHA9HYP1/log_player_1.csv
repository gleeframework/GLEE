Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a great price for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
