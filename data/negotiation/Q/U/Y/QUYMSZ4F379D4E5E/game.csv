"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's value, my budget is currently capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, we're not willing to go as low as $800,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal if we both work towards a middle ground.  How about we meet at $825,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're not quite ready to meet at $825,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is our final compromise, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $850,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, and I believe that's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a way to reach an agreement at that price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we understand your position, but we're not willing to go back to $825,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $845,000. This is our final offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",845000.0,Alice,7,
