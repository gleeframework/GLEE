Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, we're not willing to go as low as $800,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're not quite ready to meet at $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we understand your position, but we're not willing to go back to $825,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $845,000. This is our final offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've negotiated as much as you can with Alice.  While you could continue to try to get a lower price, it's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to reach an agreement. You've already reached your limit, and John offers a sure thing. You might regret not getting a lower price later, but the risk of losing out completely is too high.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer."
