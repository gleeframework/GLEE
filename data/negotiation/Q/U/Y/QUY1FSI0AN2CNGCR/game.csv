"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it can bring significant benefits to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
