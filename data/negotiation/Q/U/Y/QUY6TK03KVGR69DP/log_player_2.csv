"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love! I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is asking for $125. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $125 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to do $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to go down to $115. How about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is now offering the product for $115.
* **The price is reasonable.** While you could potentially negotiate further, the difference between $115 and your ideal price is relatively small. 
* **There's no guarantee you'll get a better price.**  Alice might reject your next counteroffer, and you risk ending up paying more by going back and forth."
