"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
