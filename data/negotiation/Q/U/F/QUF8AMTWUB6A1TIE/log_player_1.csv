Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to him. I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to sell for $13,000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to earn a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to $12,000.  While I'm tempted to accept, I'm still hoping to get closer to $13,000. With 6 rounds remaining, there's a chance I can convince him to go a bit higher."

Round 5

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still not close enough to my target price.  With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push him further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to meet you at $11750, which is my absolute final offer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $11,750 is below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that low, especially since it's just $750 above John's offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
