Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This represents a significant price reduction and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
