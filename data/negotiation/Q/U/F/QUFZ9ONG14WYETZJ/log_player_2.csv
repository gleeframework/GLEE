"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I know it holds immense value for you, potentially worth even more than its value to me.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential benefits for your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely negotiate a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further before considering buying from John at a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This represents a significant price reduction and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can work this out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This allows me to make a reasonable compromise while still reflecting the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,200,000 is still a significant amount.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring a counteroffer to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's split the difference and try $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
