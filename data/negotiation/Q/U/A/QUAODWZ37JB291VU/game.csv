"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be a good addition to my inventory, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget.  How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit outside my budget.  I could make a move to $700,000, but that's really pushing it for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think $800,000 is the minimum I can accept. How about we meet at $820,000?",820000.0,Alice,5,
