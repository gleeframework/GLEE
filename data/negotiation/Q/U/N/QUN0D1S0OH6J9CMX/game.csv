"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle at $10500?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we meet at $9750? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
