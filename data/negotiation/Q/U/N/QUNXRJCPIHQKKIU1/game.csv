"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
