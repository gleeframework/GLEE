"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is way above his maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a low counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.  He's leaving some room for compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still too high. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to Bob's $9,000 counteroffer.  Bob can still get a good deal from John, so there's no need to rush into buying from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that he is willing to compromise, but he is still aiming to save as much money as possible. It's a reasonable compromise between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, Bob has two choices: 

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This would get him the product but would be a loss for him since he could get it from John for $10,000.
* **Reject and counteroffer:**  This allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. He can still buy from John as a backup.

It's more strategic for Bob to reject and try to counteroffer one more time to see if Alice will come down further.  If she doesn't, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now making his final counteroffer. He's going all the way up to $10,000, which is his maximum budget and what John is offering. This is a clear signal that he is serious about buying the product but won't go higher. It's now up to Alice to decide if she wants to accept or reject his offer."
