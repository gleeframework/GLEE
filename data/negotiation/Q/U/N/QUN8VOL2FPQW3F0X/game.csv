"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer the product to you for $11500. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $10750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $12000. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I can offer the product to you for $11250, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000",10500.0,Bob,8,
