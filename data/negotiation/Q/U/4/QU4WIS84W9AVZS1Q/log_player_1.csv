Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price, leaving room for potential compromise. This doesn't necessarily mean Bob will pay $15,000, but it sets a strong anchor point.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" subtly implies that the product is worth the asking price.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob into the conversation and encourage him to counter-offer.  

By starting high and engaging Bob in discussion, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a price closer to her ideal outcome while still having John as a guaranteed backup."
