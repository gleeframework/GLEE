"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to drive the price down further.  There's always the option to buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal here.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has made it clear she won't budge on her price. Bob has already made two counteroffers, and while he is still trying to negotiate a lower price, it seems unlikely Alice will accept anything lower than $875,000. At this point, it's wiser for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 rather than risk losing more time and potentially ending up paying more than that."
