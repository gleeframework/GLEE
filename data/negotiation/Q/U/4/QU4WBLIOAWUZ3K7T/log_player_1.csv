{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but still gives him room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price of $12,000 as possible.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation and potentially lower the price slightly or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept such a low offer right away. I'll send a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,500?  That's still a good price for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price and is also higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to $12,000, it's important to consider the time and effort involved in continued negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
