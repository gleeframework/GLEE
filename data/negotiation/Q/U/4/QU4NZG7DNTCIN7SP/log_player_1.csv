Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we want to start with a higher offer to explore potential profit above our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $16,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he finds it too high. This allows for a potential compromise where both parties feel they're getting a fair deal.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" of the product subtly reinforces to Bob that it's worth considering even at a higher price. Offering it before a public listing can also be perceived as giving Bob a special opportunity. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response (if he negotiates, seems put off by the price, etc.), Alice can adjust her approach in further communication."
