{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is key for a successful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to my desired range.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His initial reaction will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product.
* **Keep options open:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can adjust based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer just yet. 

**Strategy:**

* **Test the waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's genuinely interested in the product and might be willing to go higher.
* **Gain leverage:**  By making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** Showing that I've considered his perspective helps build rapport.
* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Highlight the value:** Emphasizing the product's worth reinforces the justification for my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing leverage and compromise:** I'm aiming to get a price closer to my desired range while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing for flexibility:** Bob's response will indicate how much he's willing to pay for the product.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the negotiation friendly and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly closer to my minimum of $12,000, and it represents a decent profit for me. While I'd like to get more, I'm happy to accept this offer.  

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but this offer is only $1,500 less than my desired price.
* **Time is money:**  Continued negotiation could take longer, and I'm eager to close the deal.
* **Potential for future business:** Accepting a fair offer builds goodwill with Bob, potentially leading to future opportunities."
