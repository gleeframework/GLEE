"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
