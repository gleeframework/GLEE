Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.

The product is worth $8,000 to me, and I can sell it to John for that price. Therefore, I won't accept Bob's offer. I will attempt to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good value for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices, so I'll offer $8,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
