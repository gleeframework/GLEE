Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my operations. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can close the deal closer to my value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to recoup my investment and make sure this deal benefits both of us. How about $1,050,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it still gives you a significant discount compared to my initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution, and I appreciate that. While $975,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay within my minimum price range. Let's split the difference and go with $1,012,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount compared to my initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
