{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows us both to get a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room to bargain.
* **Provides a strong incentive for Bob to accept:**  $14,000 is still a good deal for him, and a better deal than going to John.
* **Protects your interests:**  You're still getting a profit above your minimum of $10,000. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is still a profit for you, it's significantly lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counter-offer:** You can try to get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, you show that you're not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **See if Bob is willing to budge:**  He might be willing to compromise if he sees you're serious about getting a better price. 

**Next Move:**  You should send a counteroffer that is closer to your initial offer of $14,000 but still below Bob's ideal price of $15,000. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $12,500 is only $2,500 below your initial offer of $14,000. This is a good deal considering Bob's initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you're accepting his offer, you could still suggest a slight increase to $12,750 or $13,000 to see if he's willing to budge. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away entirely, leaving you with the option of selling to John for $10,000, which is a significant loss compared to $12,500. 

**Next Move:**  Since you're accepting Bob's offer,  you can try to negotiate a slightly higher price (e.g., $12,750) if you feel confident in your position. But be prepared to accept $12,500 if he's firm on that price."
