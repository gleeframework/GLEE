"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to be careful with my finances.",12500.0,Bob,4,
