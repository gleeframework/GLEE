"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $14,000 for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is phrased politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship. We provide a reason (""tighter budget"") for the counteroffer, which is more likely to be received well than just a blunt number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $12,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, she's still above her product's worth to her ($12,000). This indicates there's still room for us to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Time on Our Side:** We have plenty of rounds left. There's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price exactly halfway between our previous offer ($10,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($12,500). This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both sides.
* **Moving Closer to Our Target:**  We're inching closer to a price that's significantly below John's offer ($15,000) while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. My counteroffer is $12,250 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving slowly towards our desired price range. This suggests she might be willing to go even lower, especially if we show continued resistance. 
* **Alternative Exists:** We have the safety net of buying from John for $15,000. This gives us leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still interested. Would you be willing to do $11,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're starting to signal that we're reaching the upper limit of our budget (""close to my limit"").  However, we still present it as a ""compromise"" and remain interested.
* **Small Increment:** The increase to $11,500 is small, but it keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice we're willing to meet her partway.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge how determined Alice is to stay above $12,000. Her response will be telling for our next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering our positions, I am willing to offer the product for $11,875. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice has stated that $11,875 is her ""final offer."" This is a strong signal that she's unlikely to go any lower.
* **Good Deal Achieved:** While not our ideal price, $11,875 is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 offer. It's a good compromise that meets our goal of getting a good price. 
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  If we reject this and try to push for an even lower price, we risk Alice walking away entirely. That would leave us having to buy from John at a higher price."
