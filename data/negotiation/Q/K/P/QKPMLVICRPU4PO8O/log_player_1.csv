Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both.  To be honest, anything under $105 would be difficult for me. How about we settle at $105 and call it a deal?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been considering your offers carefully. I really like the product, but I still can't go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $90.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting $90 is a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $120. It makes more financial sense to cut our losses and sell to John."
