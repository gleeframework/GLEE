"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $90 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle on $88?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
