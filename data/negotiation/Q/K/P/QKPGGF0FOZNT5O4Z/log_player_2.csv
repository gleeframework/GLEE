"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its high-quality features and exceptional performance, we believe it's worth more than what others might be offering. Considering its value, I propose to sell it to you for $140. This price not only reflects the true worth of the product but also allows us to maintain a fair transaction. I'm confident you'll find it to be an excellent investment. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is tempting, $140 is still more than your maximum budget of $120. You know you can get the product for a guaranteed $120 from John.  It makes more sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first."
