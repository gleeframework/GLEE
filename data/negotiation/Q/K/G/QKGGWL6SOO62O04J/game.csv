"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $95?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
