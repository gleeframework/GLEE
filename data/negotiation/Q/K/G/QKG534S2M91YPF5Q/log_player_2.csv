Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  Let's split the difference.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. This price is very close to your target, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my target:** $1,250,000 is within my budget of $1,500,000 and only $50,000 above my ideal price.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** We're getting close, and continuing to negotiate could take up valuable rounds.
* **Risk of a deal falling through:**  If I reject the offer, Alice might make a higher counteroffer, or we could reach an impasse.

While I'd love to get it for $1,200,000, accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and leaves me some room for future negotiations if needed."
