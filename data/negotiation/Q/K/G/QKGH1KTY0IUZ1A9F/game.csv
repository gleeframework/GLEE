"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. How about we try $9500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9200, but that's the maximum I can offer. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9200.0,Bob,6,
