"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1200000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $1050000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to accept $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1125000 is still a bit too high for me. While I understand your position, I'm only able to go up to $1100000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
