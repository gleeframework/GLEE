"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $120. This is higher than my cost and also more favorable than what I could offer elsewhere. I trust this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to John's higher price."
