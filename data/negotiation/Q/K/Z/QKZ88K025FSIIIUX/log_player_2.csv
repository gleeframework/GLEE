Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.
