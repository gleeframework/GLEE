"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you've put on it at $8,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're eager to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good price. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
