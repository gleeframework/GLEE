While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low.  I want to see if I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

I'm reducing my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.  This price is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his perceived value."

Bob is not willing to meet my price.  While I'm still hoping for a deal, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
