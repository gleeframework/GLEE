"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is under your $10,000 limit, you can do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to either lower the price or you can buy from John for $10,000."
