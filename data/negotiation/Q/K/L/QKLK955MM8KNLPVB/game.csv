"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  However, I'm open to discussing this further to find a mutually agreeable figure.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make this work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $700,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind.  Let's try $825,000.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
