Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he's highly motivated. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a (small) incentive to accept the offer rather than letting it go to John."
