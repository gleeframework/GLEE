{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $13,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, which can make him more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to counter if needed, keeping in mind my minimum of $10,000 and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While John offers $10,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob.  I will start by offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above $10,000, to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $13,000 to $11,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $11,000 is still above my minimum of $10,000 and ensures I don't lose money.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to accept my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I will consider whether to accept John's offer of $10,000 or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **No Guarantee of Better:** While I could potentially negotiate further, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and I'm already close to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing a good price for my product."
