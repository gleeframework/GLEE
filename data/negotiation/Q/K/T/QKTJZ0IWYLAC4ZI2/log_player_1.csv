Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10,000 to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 significantly undervalues this product and what it can do for you.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  $18,000 is still more than double what I'm willing to pay.  If you can come down to $12,000, I think we could make a deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big jump from my last offer. To be honest, anything over $13,000 is pushing it for me. If you can meet me at that price, I'm ready to agree today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $13,000.  While we could try to negotiate him up a little, the difference is unlikely to be substantial. Accepting his offer would mean a $2,000 loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
