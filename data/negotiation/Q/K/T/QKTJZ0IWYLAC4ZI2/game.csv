"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10,000 to consider it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 significantly undervalues this product and what it can do for you.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  $18,000 is still more than double what I'm willing to pay.  If you can come down to $12,000, I think we could make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big jump from my last offer. To be honest, anything over $13,000 is pushing it for me. If you can meet me at that price, I'm ready to agree today.",13000.0,Bob,6,
