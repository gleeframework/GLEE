"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $11,000 is really the most I can do. If you're unable to meet that, I might need to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, that price is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially stretch to $12,000, but that's really my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
