"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit higher than your budget, Bob. I'm willing to come down further to $10000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",10000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9500. I can meet you at $9800. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal."
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but I want to make sure you know that this is a great deal for you. If you're interested, I can throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can meet you at $9600. That's as low as I can go."
"I'm making a big concession, Bob, but I really think this product is worth it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9600, and I'll even throw in some additional services to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",9600.0,Alice,7,,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I'm disappointed that we couldn't meet in the middle, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $9600, and I'm starting to think that we're not a good fit. I'm going to hold out for a better offer."
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $9600, Bob. If you're still interested in the product, I'm willing to give you a bit of time to think about it. I'm going to leave the offer on the table, but I'm not making any further concessions. If you're not willing to meet me at $9600, I'll have to consider other options.",9600.0,Alice,9,,
