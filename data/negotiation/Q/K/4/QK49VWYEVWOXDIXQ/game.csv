"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That seems fair to both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
