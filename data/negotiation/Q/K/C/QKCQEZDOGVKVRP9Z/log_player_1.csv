Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $145 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob. He might be willing to go a bit higher, especially if he's genuinely interested. 
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum.

By starting the negotiation higher, we increase the chances of securing a better deal with Bob while having John as a safety net."
