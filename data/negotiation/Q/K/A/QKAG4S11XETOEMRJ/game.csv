"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
