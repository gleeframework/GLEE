"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the value and the ""deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not immediately going for the highest possible price, allowing for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, $95 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Opportunity to gain more:**  I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially secure a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair"" compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:**  The price is still above my minimum value, ensuring I'm making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $97.50 as a compromise. This would allow us to stay closer to my budget while still respecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Opportunity to gain more:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.
* **Risk of John:**  While selling to John would guarantee $100, I'm not yet convinced I can't get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's seal the deal and both walk away happy!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Strong Signal:**  By stating my ""absolute minimum"", I'm clearly showing Bob that I'm serious about this price and won't go lower.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""win-win"" scenario to encourage Bob to accept."
