"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a special introductory price of $11,000 for you. This is a unique opportunity to secure an asset that is worth $12,000 to you, at a competitive rate. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can discuss how this product can contribute to your success. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($12,000).  This means you save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer.  While you could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk is that she'll either reject your counteroffer or withdraw her offer entirely.  It's more beneficial to secure the product at a lower price than you were initially planning to pay."
