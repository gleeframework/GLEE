(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially with a price that's significantly lower than your maximum.  You can likely get a better deal than $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully will encourage Alice to come down a bit.  We'll see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still a bit high. I'll try to negotiate a little more to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a limit."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm going to increase my offer again, but still stay below Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping that she'll meet me in the middle, and we can close the deal on this round."
