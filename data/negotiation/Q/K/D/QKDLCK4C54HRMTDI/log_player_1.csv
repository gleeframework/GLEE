Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than $10,000."
