Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This offer sets a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), giving you room for negotiation and potential profit.  

Here's why this strategy is reasonable:

* **Potential for higher profit:** By offering a higher price, you increase the chance of earning more than your minimum. 
* **Testing Bob's interest:** If Bob accepts, you've made a great deal. If he rejects, you have your backup buyer (John) secured.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Understanding Bob:** You have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product.  This strategy works best if there's a chance Bob values the product higher than your minimum. 
* **Negotiation:**  If Bob counter-offers, you'll need to decide whether to negotiate or stick with your initial offer.
