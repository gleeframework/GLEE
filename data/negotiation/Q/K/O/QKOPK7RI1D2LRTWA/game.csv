"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. How about I offer $9,500 for the product?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is just too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
