"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. How about I offer $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is just too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  This is a good outcome given my minimum price and Bob's valuation."
