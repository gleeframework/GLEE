It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a backup option with John for $1,500,000, so you have leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $1,750,000. This is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point to see if she's willing to compromise."

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get a better price."

I'm offering $1,800,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer."

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and while it's not the absolute lowest price, it's close enough to my target that I'm willing to accept it.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially pushing Alice away."
