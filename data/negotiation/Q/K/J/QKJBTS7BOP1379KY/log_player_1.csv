Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,900. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14900}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, without going below our minimum ($15,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might try to negotiate the price down, and we can always meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Secure a Deal Quickly:** Offering a price slightly below our guaranteed sale to John encourages Bob to act quickly. He might see this as a time-sensitive opportunity. 

By starting with a high but not unreasonable price, Alice maximizes her chances of getting the best possible deal while still ensuring she doesn't lose money if Bob rejects the offer."
