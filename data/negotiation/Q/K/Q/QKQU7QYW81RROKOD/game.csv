"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still not within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. Can we discuss this further?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,300,000. This price is fair, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to try to meet you at $1,275,000 again, but I'm willing to go as high as $1,285,000. Can we meet in the middle on that?",1285000.0,Bob,6,
