"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $1,200,000 is my minimum, but I can definitely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still not within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial goal of $1,400,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,300,000. This price is fair, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to try to meet you at $1,275,000 again, but I'm willing to go as high as $1,285,000. Can we meet in the middle on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,285,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the value to Bob and it's above my minimum of $1,200,000.  It's also closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000.  With only 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking a stalemate to try for a higher price."
