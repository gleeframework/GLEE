Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $13,000 is still a bit low for me."
