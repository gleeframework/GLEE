Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher initially is a good negotiating tactic.  $1,300,000 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" to subtly reinforce the product's worth in Bob's mind, potentially justifying the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, opening up a dialogue.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more appealing."
