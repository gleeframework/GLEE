Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe it's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this deal work. This still leaves a good margin for me, but also shows my commitment to making this happen. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a good compromise. While it's not the highest price I'd like to get, it's above my minimum and still leaves a comfortable margin. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
