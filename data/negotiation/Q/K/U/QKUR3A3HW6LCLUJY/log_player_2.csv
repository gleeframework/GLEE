"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 maximum for the product, and John is selling it for that price, it's the best option.  There's no reason to negotiate with Alice, as you know you can get the product for the same price elsewhere."
