"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,062,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
