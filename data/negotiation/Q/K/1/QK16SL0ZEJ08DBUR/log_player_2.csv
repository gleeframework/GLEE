"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make me a deal on it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay $100 for the product. Since Alice is offering the product at $100, you have no incentive to accept her offer immediately. You can reject her offer and see if she'll counter with a lower price. If she doesn't, you can simply buy from John for $100."
