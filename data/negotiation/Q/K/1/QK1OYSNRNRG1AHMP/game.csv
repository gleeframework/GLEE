"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000.  Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $750,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to meet my minimum threshold. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very fair throughout this negotiation.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to get this done. I need to be mindful of my budget.  Do you think we can make a deal at this price?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $780,000. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $815,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this product. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
