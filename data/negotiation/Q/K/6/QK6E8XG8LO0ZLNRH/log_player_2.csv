"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You can likely get a better price, especially since you have 10 rounds.
* **Buying from John immediately is too expensive.** While it's a guaranteed deal, it's at the full price.
* **Negotiation is the best option.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start the negotiation process and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  A $200,000 reduction from Alice's offer is significant but not outrageous.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's likely Alice won't accept this offer immediately, but it establishes a starting point for further negotiation.
* **Early counteroffer:**  By making a bold counteroffer early on, you can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially push her to accept a better price in later rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still not optimal.**  You're already saving $400,000 compared to John, but there's still potential for further negotiation.
* **More rounds to negotiate.**  With 7 rounds remaining, there's ample time to try and reach a lower price.
* **Continuing to negotiate increases your chances of getting a better deal.** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so it's worth exploring if she's willing to go lower."

* **More rounds to negotiate.** With 5 rounds remaining, there's still opportunity to push for a lower price. 
* **John is still too expensive.**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John.

**Strategy:**  By continuing to negotiate, you increase your chances of securing the product for closer to your target price.  While accepting this offer would be a good deal, it's worth seeing if you can close the gap even further."

* **Building momentum:** With fewer rounds remaining, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a deal is crucial.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  Alice's offer is only $10,000 higher than your last counteroffer and is very close to your desired price range.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and not securing a deal is high.
* **John's price is still significantly higher:**  Even with a slightly higher price, Alice's offer is still substantially cheaper than John's.

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures a purchase at a reasonable price, minimizing risk and maximizing potential savings.  The chance of getting a lower offer in the remaining rounds is slim, and the potential loss outweighs the possible gain."
