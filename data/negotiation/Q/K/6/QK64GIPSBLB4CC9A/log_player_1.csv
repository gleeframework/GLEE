Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation. 
* **It's clear and concise:** You clearly state the price and provide a reason for it. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation with Bob, while also having a safety net with John's offer if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  This would still give you a significant profit and is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer you made. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to maintain leverage and potentially reach a price closer to your initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making the price more justifiable.
* **Fairness:**  The price is presented as a compromise, suggesting a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
