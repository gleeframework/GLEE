Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is above Bob's perceived value of $100, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:** $115 is below your minimum of $120, leaving room for you to make concessions.
* **Reasonable:** It's not an outrageous price, making it more likely Bob will consider it. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale.  If Bob rejects this offer, you'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $120 to you, so accepting $100 would be a loss.
* **You have a better alternative:** Selling to John guarantees you $120, which is a higher profit.
* **Negotiation room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range, potentially still getting a better deal than selling to John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and increase the chances of securing a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $100. It shows that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $110 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you won't lose money on the sale.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** By suggesting a fair price and framing it as a win-win situation, this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob.

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still safeguarding your profit. If Bob rejects again, you'll need to re-evaluate and decide whether to stick with your counteroffer, make another concession, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Risk of Further Concessions:**  If you reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a high risk that Bob will continue to push for a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees you $120, a sure profit and a more reliable outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

While you could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of ending up with a lower price or a deal falling through is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
