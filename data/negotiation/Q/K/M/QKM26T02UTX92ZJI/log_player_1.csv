Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  This price positions the offer as a win-win. Bob gets the product for less than he values it, and you earn a substantial profit above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
