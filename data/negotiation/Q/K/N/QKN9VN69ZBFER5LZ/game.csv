"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
