Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her earnings. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Strategic Communication:**  The message uses positive language (""fantastic opportunity,"" ""fair deal,"" ""intrinsic worth"") to highlight the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Why not ask for more?**

While Alice could start higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob. A price too close to $1,200,000 might make him immediately reject the offer without further consideration. This approach aims to find a sweet spot that entices Bob while maximizing Alice's potential gain."
