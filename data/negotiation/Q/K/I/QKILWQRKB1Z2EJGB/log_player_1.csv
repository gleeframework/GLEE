Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $11,900. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,900 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still keeping the price attractive. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""discounted price"" and ""significant value"" to make the offer more appealing.

**Why this is better than offering $12,000 directly:**

*  Offering $12,000 right away leaves no room for negotiation and might discourage Bob, knowing he can't haggle. This strategy increases the chance of a successful sale."
