Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's value of $8,000, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's also lower than your fallback price of $10,000, ensuring you still make a profit. This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher sale price."
