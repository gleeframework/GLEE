"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  My initial price is $1,150,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is below what I need to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
