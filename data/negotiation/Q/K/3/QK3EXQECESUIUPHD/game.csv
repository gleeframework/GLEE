"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000? It's a fair price for a product that's worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's worth a lot to you, but I have a budget in mind.  How about $8,000? That's a significant move on my part.",8000.0,Bob,4,
