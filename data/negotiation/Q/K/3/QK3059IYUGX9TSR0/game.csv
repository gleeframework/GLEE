"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to balance that with the value I need to get from the sale. I can do $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm willing to pay. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I can do $14,500. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm open to negotiations.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $14,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm open to exploring other options.",14250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",13750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to make one final offer: $14,000 is still too low for me, but I can meet you at $14,000 if you're willing to throw in some extras or a service that adds value to the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, and that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $8,000.",13500.0,Bob,10,
