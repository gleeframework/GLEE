"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate and time before we need to consider John's offer.  We'll reject this offer and try to nudge him higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle on $850,000.  This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could try to push for a little more, Bob has met his maximum valuation. Accepting $800,000 now guarantees a significant profit, whereas continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely.  It's a good outcome!"
