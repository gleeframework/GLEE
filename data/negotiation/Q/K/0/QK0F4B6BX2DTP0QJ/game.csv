"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle on $850,000.  This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",850000.0,Alice,5,
