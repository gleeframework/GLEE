Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll counter with an offer of $9,800.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

We're getting very close to John's price.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can get a slightly better deal than John offers."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $9,800 is just a touch too high for me.  My final offer is $9,500.  If this works, we have an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll counter with an offer of $9,700. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700

Alice is clearly comfortable in the $9,700 - $9,800 range and we are unlikely to get a better deal from her.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John."
