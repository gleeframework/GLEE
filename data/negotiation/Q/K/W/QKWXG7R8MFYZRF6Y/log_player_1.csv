**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that justifies continuing the negotiation.  At this stage, the difference between Bob's potential offer and John's guaranteed offer is too significant to ignore.  Selling to John ensures the maximum profit and avoids further time spent negotiating."
