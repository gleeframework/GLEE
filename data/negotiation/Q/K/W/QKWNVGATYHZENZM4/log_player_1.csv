Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it implies that the product is valuable enough to warrant the asking price.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to secure a deal with Bob specifically, you could adjust the starting price."
