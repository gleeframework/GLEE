,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That gives us both some room for a good deal.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $145? I'm really interested in the product and want to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $150. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it's still a good price for you considering the value of the product. I really want to make this deal work, so let's see if we can agree on this.",150.0,Alice,5,
