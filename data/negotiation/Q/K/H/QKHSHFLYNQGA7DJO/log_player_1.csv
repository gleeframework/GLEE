"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significantly higher price than my minimum.  I'm confident Bob will be interested in the product, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have 9 rounds to close the deal, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, time is running out. Bob's offer of $975,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also  a significant profit for me and worth taking, especially with limited rounds remaining."
