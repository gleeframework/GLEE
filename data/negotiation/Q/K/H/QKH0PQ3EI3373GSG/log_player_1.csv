{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower.  While I'm not happy about selling for the minimum price, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will only result in further decreases and a possible deadlock. To avoid this risk, it's best to sell to John now and guarantee a secure deal."
