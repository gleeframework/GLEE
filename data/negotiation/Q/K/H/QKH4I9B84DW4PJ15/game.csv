"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $1,025,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the value you'll gain.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
