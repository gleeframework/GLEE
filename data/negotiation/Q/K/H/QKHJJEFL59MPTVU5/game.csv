"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000.  This is a good compromise and a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,225,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,275,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
