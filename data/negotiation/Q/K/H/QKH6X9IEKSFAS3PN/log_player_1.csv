{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage a positive response.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if needed, but I can always fall back on John's offer if it doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob is clearly interested, so I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,500 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
