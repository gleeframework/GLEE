Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit while leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price lower than your ideal, you signal that you're open to discussion. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your potential earnings while still keeping the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering I could buy it elsewhere for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value.  You might be able to secure a price closer to $8,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering you can buy it elsewhere for $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,250.  That's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $7,250 is still below your desired value, it's very close to your minimum.  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a complete breakdown in talks.  It also saves you from having to sell to John and potentially losing out on the chance of a higher price in the future."
