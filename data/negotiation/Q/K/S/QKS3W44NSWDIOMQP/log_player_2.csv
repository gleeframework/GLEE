"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm really eager to buy this product from you, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you consider $125? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really close to my budget limit, and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to come down to $115.  That would be a great price for me, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 115}
