"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about meeting in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm really eager to buy this product from you, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you consider $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really close to my budget limit, and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to come down to $115.  That would be a great price for me, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",115.0,Bob,6,
