"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I could do  $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This reflects some flexibility on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $975,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
