"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits considerably higher.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings to both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
