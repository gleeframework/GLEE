"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer reflects some movement on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,225,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
