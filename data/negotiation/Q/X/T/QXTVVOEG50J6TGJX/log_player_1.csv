"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer is above my minimum, but below John's offer, so I can still make a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal profit margin.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is very attractive, it's wise to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first before settling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this work for me.  I'm confident this product is worth it for you, and I'm happy to keep talking to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility while still keeping the price closer to my target.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message reinforces the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him why he should be willing to pay more. 
* **Maintain Openness:**  The message  keeps the door open for further negotiation, encouraging Bob to make another counteroffer.
* **John's Offer in Mind:**  The counteroffer keeps me in a good position, not too far from John's offer, but leaving room for further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for improvement.
* **Potential for a Higher Deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since we're nearing the middle ground.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a cushion, allowing me to be more firm in negotiations with Bob.
* **Maintaining Control:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in the driver's seat and allows me to make the next move, potentially securing a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would give me a little more wiggle room, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway while still pushing for a better price. It demonstrates flexibility without conceding too much.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message subtly reminds Bob about the value of the product, making a slightly higher price more palatable.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By counter-offering instead of accepting, I maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a higher price.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** The counteroffer keeps me within striking distance of John's offer, providing a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. How about we try $9,800? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to a Deal:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below my minimum.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room to try and push for a slightly higher price.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** Having John's offer as a safety net gives me the confidence to keep trying for a better price with Bob.  We're getting close to the end, but I want to exhaust all options before settling for a lower price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is getting close, but I need to get a little closer to $10,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,900? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm again offering to meet Bob halfway, but this time the difference is only $100. It shows a strong commitment to reaching a deal while still achieving a price that's more favorable to me.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob,  reinforcing the notion that even at $9,900 it's still a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:** I add a sense of urgency with ""Let's close this deal!"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's previous offer kept me in control. This counteroffer gives Bob a final chance to accept, but if he rejects, I can consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $9,800, and I'm starting to get a little worried that I might not be able to get the product at a good price. Can you think about meeting me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $200 above my absolute minimum. While it's not ideal, it's getting close. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the last few rounds, and there's a risk that further negotiation will only lead to a stalemate.
* **John's Offer is Highly Attractive:** The $15,000 offer from John guarantees me a significantly higher profit. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Given the uncertainty of Bob accepting a higher price, selling to John minimizes the risk of getting a much lower price or no deal at all."
