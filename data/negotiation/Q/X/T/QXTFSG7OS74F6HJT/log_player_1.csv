"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""incredible value and potential,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** This initial price is roughly the midpoint between my valuation ($1,500,000) and a price significantly above Bob's ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation in either direction.
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product,  which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but accepting this early would leave a lot of money on the table.  I'll counter in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers unique value and its potential is substantial.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate but reiterate that his initial price is too low.
* **Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value, keeping the perceived worth high in Bob's mind.
* **Strategic Movement:**  My counteroffer moves down from my initial price but is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have time, I want to make progress in each round. A significant drop encourages Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could push for more in subsequent rounds, the gains are likely to be smaller. There's a risk Bob could dig in or the negotiation could stall. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner, which has its own value. 

Overall, accepting $1,400,000 is a strategically sound decision. It secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal by pushing too hard."
