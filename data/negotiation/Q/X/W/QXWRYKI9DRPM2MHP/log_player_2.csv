"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there's potential to get it even lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's offering a price that's still below Alice's minimum but closer to his own valuation. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying but also wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is still a good deal for Bob. While he might be able to get it a bit lower, the risk of going through more rounds is not worth the potential savings.  It's getting closer to his desired price and there's a chance Alice won't budge further.  It's a good balance of risk and reward."
