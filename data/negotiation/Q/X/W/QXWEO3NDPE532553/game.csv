"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true value.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1.25 million.  Would you consider $1,260,000? I believe that's a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1260000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,260,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $1,250,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring to your business. If you're not able to meet this price, I understand, but I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet your final offer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
