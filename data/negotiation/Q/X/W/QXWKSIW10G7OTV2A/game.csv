"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $100 to make this work. Let me know if you're interested in that.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95?  That's a good middle ground for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
