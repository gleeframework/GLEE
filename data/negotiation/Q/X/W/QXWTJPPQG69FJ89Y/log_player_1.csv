"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a good chunk of the value difference.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still below my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as John's, and we're already in round 4.  There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, and I'm risking losing time and potentially missing out on a deal with John. It's time to secure the guaranteed $800,000."
