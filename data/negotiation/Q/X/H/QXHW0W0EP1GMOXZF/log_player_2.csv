Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts on this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer."
