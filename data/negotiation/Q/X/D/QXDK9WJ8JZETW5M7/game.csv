"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
