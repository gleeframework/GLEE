"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower offer closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,150,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with the value you place on it while allowing me to stay within my budget. Thank you for your understanding.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
