"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's a step closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is still a bit too high. How about $10750? I'm trying to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $10,750 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I believe I can still negotiate a bit more.  I'll try to meet Bob in the middle on my next offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $10,875. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}

Round 6

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000.  

Even though I'm not able to get my ideal price with Bob, John's offer is more than my minimum, and the negotiation with Bob is becoming a bit tiresome. It's time to move on to a more certain deal."
