Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $175?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $160? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is still a good profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
