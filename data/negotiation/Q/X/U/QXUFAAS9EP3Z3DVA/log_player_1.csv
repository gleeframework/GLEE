Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,450,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.
    * It's slightly below our guaranteed sale price, ensuring we still gain if Bob accepts. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and inviting Bob's perspective to start a conversation.

This approach balances risk and reward, maximizing our chances of securing the highest possible sale price."
