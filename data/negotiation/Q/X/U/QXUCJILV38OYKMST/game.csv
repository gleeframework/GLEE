"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above what I'm able to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
