"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward and secure the better deal."
