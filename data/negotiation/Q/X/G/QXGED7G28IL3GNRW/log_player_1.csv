Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have the advantage of knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **High Anchor:** This initial price sets a high anchor point, making it more likely Bob will accept a price higher than our minimum.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, with John as a backup buyer at $800,000, we have a strong safety net."
