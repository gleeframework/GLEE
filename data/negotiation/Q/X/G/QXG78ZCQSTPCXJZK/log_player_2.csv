It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room to bargain."

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Alice is already willing to move on price, so there's a chance she'll come down further. You're getting close to your target price of $10,000."

Alice is offering $10,750, which is above your maximum price of $10,000. It's better to go with John's offer and save yourself $750."
