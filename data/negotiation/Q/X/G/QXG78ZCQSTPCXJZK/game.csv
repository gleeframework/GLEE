"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $10,250.  It would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to get this purchase finalized.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",10750.0,Alice,5,
