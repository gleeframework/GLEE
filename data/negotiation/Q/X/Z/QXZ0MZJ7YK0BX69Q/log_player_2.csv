"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

 Alice is starting high. There's room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $95 seems a bit steep. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $70, we're aiming significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a price that would be a good deal if accepted.
* **Respectful Tone:** We want to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Alice knows we have the option to buy from John for $100. Our offer of $70 puts pressure on her while still being below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, how about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $85 is better than $95, it's still above Alice's valuation of the product. 
* **Leveraging John's Price:**  We're getting closer to John's price of $100, which gives us some bargaining power. Alice might be willing to go lower rather than risk losing the sale."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? It's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 is a significant jump from our previous offer of $70, but still below both Alice's current offer and John's price.
* **Direct & Clear:**  We're stating our desired price directly and confidently."
