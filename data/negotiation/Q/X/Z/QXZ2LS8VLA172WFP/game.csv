"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we both see in it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
