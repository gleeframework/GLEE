Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob, but I don't want to scare him away with an unrealistic initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value. While I would prefer to sell it to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my preferred price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable value. It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not sure how much more I can convince Bob to pay.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be my fallback option, but I'd rather make a deal with Bob."
