"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. I'm willing to offer you $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $800000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
