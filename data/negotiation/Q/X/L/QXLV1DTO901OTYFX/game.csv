"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as you'll be acquiring a product that aligns perfectly with your needs at a price that's well below its estimated value. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
