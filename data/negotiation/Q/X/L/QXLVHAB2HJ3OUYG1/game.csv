"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can only go as high as $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a substantial reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's inherent worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. However, $1,100,000 is still considerably below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on a product I know holds immense value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial limitations.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
