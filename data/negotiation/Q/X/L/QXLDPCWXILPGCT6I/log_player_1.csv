Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's a steal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer, as he'll still be making a profit.
* **It's lower than my valuation:** This means I still make a profit, even if Bob rejects the offer. 

By offering a price in the middle, I increase the chances of Bob accepting, while still ensuring I get a good price. If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $150."
