"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. My asking price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is too high. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really like the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still trying to get the price down as low as possible.  He should see if he can get Alice to go even lower with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $13,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a fair price for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $13,000 is definitely in the right ballpark, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He has already rejected a price of $13,500 from Alice. While he could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the price will not drop below his maximum budget of $12,000. Buying from John is the most reliable way to ensure he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
