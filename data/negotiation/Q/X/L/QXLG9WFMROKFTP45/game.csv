"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really like the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $13,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a fair price for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $13,000 is definitely in the right ballpark, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think we can make this happen.",13500.0,Alice,5,
