"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $80? That's the maximum I can afford.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",100.0,Alice,3,
