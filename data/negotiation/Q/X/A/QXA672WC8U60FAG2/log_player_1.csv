"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and has a high perceived value for the product.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which indicates he's interested.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer again.  If he doesn't come up in the next round, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer at $8,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate fairly.  If he rejects this offer, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum, and I'm concerned that he's just trying to lowball me.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  At least I'll get my minimum price."
