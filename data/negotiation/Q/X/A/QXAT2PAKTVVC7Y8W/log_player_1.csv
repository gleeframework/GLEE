Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's value of $8,000, giving me a chance to make a profit. It's also a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room to potentially compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and selling to John would net me the same amount, accepting Bob's offer is the best option. It avoids further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
