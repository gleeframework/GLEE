"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000?  I think we can find a happy medium.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close to a deal here, but $10,625 is still a bit too low. To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and go with $10,812.50? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.  Let's make this happen!",10812.5,Alice,7,
