Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000?  I think we can find a happy medium."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $10,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think we can both be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm holding firm at $11,000.  This is a good compromise, and I hope Bob will see that. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, but I'd rather close the deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, we're still a significant distance away. I'm hoping that a few more rounds of negotiation will get us closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, and if Bob continues to be inflexible, I might have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal here, but $10,625 is still a bit too low. To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and go with $10,812.50? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10812.50}
```

I'm offering a compromise price that's almost exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this will show him that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still looking for a price that's closer to my minimum.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm starting to get nervous about losing this deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and Bob is still holding firm at $10,500.  I've been pushing for a better price, but I'm realizing that it's unlikely he'll come up much higher.  I can't risk losing the deal to John, so I'm going to sell to him for $12,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's the best I can do in this situation."
