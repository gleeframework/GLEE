Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to start high.  This allows for potential negotiation downward while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **Justification for Price:** The message hints at the product's high value without revealing specifics, making the higher price seem justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, the message keeps the door open for negotiation and doesn't put him immediately on the defensive.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point.  Even if he doesn't accept the initial $1,500,000, he's more likely to counter with a higher number than if you started at a lower price.  Worst-case scenario, you have John as a backup buyer."
