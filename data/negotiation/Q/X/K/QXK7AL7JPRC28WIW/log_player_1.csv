Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $12,000 is my minimum, I think I can get a better price by negotiating further.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  $12,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and I have a few rounds left.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $12,500 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,800.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm looking for, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
