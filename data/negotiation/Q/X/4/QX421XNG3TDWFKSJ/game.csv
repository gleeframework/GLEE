"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. How about $950,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this offer to be very attractive. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $912,500?",912500.0,Bob,6,
