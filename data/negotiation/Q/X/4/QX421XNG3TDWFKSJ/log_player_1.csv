"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum price of $1,200,000, but it gives Bob a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. How about $950,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this offer to be very attractive. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $912,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $912,500 is still below my minimum desired price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and this offer is a good compromise.  It's getting close to the end of our rounds, and it's better to close the deal than risk losing it altogether and having to sell to John."
