Considering its intrinsic value to you, I propose a purchase price of $12,000. This offer is tailored to provide you with a substantial return on investment while also ensuring we receive a fair compensation for our efforts and resources invested into this product. We are confident that this price aligns well with both our needs and your expectations. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially bringing this opportunity to fruition.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, $12,000 is significantly more than your $8,000 limit and the $8,000 John is offering.  You have a guaranteed alternative at a much lower price."
