"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product has potential, the price point you've presented is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds for your business.  I'm confident that with a closer look at the long-term benefits, we can find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my commitment to making this deal work while still recognizing the product's true value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. To move this forward, I could offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere at this price point. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe your assessment doesn't reflect the full value this product brings. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in building strong business relationships and I see potential in partnering with you.  I'm willing to significantly reduce my price to $1,600,000, but this is non-negotiable. It's a limited-time offer reflecting my commitment to making this deal work for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
