Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.

I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds for your business.  I'm confident that with a closer look at the long-term benefits, we can find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my commitment to making this deal work while still recognizing the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe your assessment doesn't reflect the full value this product brings. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in building strong business relationships and I see potential in partnering with you.  I'm willing to significantly reduce my price to $1,600,000, but this is non-negotiable. It's a limited-time offer reflecting my commitment to making this deal work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but her ""non-negotiable"" offer is still significantly above your alternative option. You've already presented your maximum price, and there's no indication Alice will come down further. It's time to walk away and secure the product at your target price from John."
