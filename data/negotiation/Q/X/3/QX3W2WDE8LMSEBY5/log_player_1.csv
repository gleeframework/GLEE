{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than John's offer, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, considering its value to you is $1500000, I think we can meet in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price without trying to get closer to my goal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $1,400,000.  This product is worth significantly more than that to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering our both values, and it allows us to meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I've lowered my price by $150,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, so I'll offer $1650000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's very close to what I'd receive by selling to John.  Accepting his offer is a good way to finalize the deal and get the transaction completed."
