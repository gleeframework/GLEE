,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is much tighter.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value of this product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for being willing to compromise.  While $12,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  $11,000 is still above my budget.  However, I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, so I'm offering it to you for $10,250. This is my last compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,
