"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $12500 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11500.  This would allow me to comfortably purchase the product.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $12750. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12750 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm limited to a budget of $12000. Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $12250? This would give us both a fair price and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",12250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
