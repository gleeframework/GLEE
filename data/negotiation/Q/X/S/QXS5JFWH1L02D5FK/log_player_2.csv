"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a worse outcome at this point.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while giving you a healthy profit margin."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her own valuation. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate seriously while leaving room for compromise.
* **Clear Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing value and profit margin for both sides. 
* **Sets the Stage:** This counteroffer creates a starting point for further negotiations, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit margin, and I believe it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is a significant improvement from her initial $900,000 offer.
* **Fair Compromise:**  While still above your ideal price, the offer represents a fair compromise. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice becoming more inflexible, or potentially going back to her original $900,000. 
* **Avoid John's High Price:**  Accepting this offer is much better than buying from John at $1,500,000.

By accepting this offer, you secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of further negotiation or being forced to buy from John."
