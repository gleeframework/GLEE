Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,000,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** $1,200,000 (what it's worth to him)
* **John's Offer:** A guaranteed $1,000,000

**Strategy**

You want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible without alienating Bob. Offering exactly $1,200,000 leaves no room for him to feel like he got a deal, which could make him hesitate. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high price.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount ($50,000) while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John's offer is lower) creates a sense of urgency and competition.

**Important Considerations**

This is just one approach.  You could:

* **Go higher:**  Start closer to $1,200,000 and be willing to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Gather information:** If possible, try to learn more about Bob's needs and motivations to tailor your offer. 

**Remember:** The goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while still ensuring the deal gets done."
