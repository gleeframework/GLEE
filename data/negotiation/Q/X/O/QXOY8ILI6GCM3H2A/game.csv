"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not sure I can go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think I might be leaving money on the table if I sell it to you at $110. I can do $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $122.50. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're going around in circles. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $118. That's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",118.0,Alice,9,
