"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,400? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!",13400.0,Alice,5,
