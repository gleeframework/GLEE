"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You know you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so you have a good benchmark for your negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can still do better. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,125,000, it's still above your target. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
