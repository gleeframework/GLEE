"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
