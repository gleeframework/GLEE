Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.
