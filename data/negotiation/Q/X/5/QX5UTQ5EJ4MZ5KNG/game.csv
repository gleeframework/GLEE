"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us -  you'll get a great value, and I'll be able to earn a fair profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that still leaves you with a good profit margin.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
