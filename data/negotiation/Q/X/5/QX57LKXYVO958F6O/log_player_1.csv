"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its immense value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the ""immense value"" of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's good to know he's interested, I'm not going to accept such a low price this early in the negotiation.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the value I need to receive for this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,750,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me the price I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** Starting by acknowledging Bob's offer shows I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product and why a lower price is not feasible for me.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Framing it Positively:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""great deal"" for Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I end with a question to keep the conversation open and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a worse deal. 

It's also worth noting that selling to John would yield the same amount, but I'm choosing to stick with Bob in hopes of a smoother transaction and potentially a better relationship in the future."
