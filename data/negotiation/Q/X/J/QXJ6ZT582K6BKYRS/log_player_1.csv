Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Goal:** Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,500,000 as possible without pushing Bob away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will far exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  Starting high shows you value the product and sets a strong tone.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While close to Bob's valuation, the price allows for some back-and-forth, making him feel involved.
* **Justification (Implied):** The phrase ""unique value proposition"" subtly hints at the product's worth to Bob, justifying the high price.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Have a walk-away point in mind (anything below $1,000,000 is unacceptable).
* **Stay Professional and Respectful:**  A positive negotiation experience can lead to future deals, even if Bob doesn't buy this time. 

Let me know what Bob says! I'm ready to help you with the next steps."
