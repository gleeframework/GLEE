"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still a handsome profit for me. Let's get this deal done!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering what the product is worth. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That's a significant compromise on my end and shows I'm serious about making this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
