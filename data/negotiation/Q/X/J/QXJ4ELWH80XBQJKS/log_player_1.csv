{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for Bob to counteroffer and still make a profit. It's important to start strong to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
