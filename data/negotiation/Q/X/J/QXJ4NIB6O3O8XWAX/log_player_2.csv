Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Alice has come down to her lowest price and it matches what John is offering. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John."
