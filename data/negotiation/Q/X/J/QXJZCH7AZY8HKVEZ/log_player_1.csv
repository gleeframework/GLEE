Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's the same amount John is offering. There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob."
