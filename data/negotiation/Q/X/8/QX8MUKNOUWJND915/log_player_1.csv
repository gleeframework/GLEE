Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected.  This sets a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate down.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth at least $1 million."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can do better.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a good price for Bob, but it's closer to what I believe the product is worth. Hopefully, he sees the value and accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to go that low yet. I'm going to counter again and try to bridge the gap.  John is still a viable option, but I'm holding out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise, and it's closer to Bob's last offer.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, Bob's offer is getting too low, and I don't want to risk going lower. John offers a safe and secure deal, and I'm going to sell to him."
