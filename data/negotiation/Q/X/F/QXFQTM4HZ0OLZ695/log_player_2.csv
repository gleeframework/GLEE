Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $90 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is unlikely to go below $85 and that's more than I'm willing to pay when I have a guaranteed option at $80."
