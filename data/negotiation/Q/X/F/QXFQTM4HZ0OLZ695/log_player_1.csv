This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals a willingness to negotiate, which is important in this scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $90 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
