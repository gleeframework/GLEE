Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. 
* **Below John's Offer:** The price is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $150, ensuring a profit for Alice if Bob accepts.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Alice gets $120, which is a good profit.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for further discussion. Alice can then decide whether to lower the price slightly or hold firm.
* **Bob rejects:**  Alice sells to John for the guaranteed $150."
