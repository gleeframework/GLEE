"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate - Alice's starting price is higher than your ideal purchase price and significantly higher than her own valuation. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price, we aim to gauge her flexibility and establish a negotiation range. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $700,000 positions us closer to Alice's valuation of $800,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how eager Alice is to sell and give us valuable information for subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go lower than this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her actual valuation, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, the current offer is still significantly higher than her $800,000 valuation. There's room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting and countering again, we can likely push the price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  By increasing our offer to $775,000, we signal our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's initial offer.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer falls directly in the middle of the current negotiating range ($700,000 - $850,000), demonstrating a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** While we haven't explicitly mentioned it, Alice is aware we have the option to buy from John.  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on her to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Alice's Valuation:**  Alice's latest offer of $825,000 is quite close to her actual valuation of $800,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Significant Savings:**  This price represents a $375,000 savings compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of Prolonged Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might become less flexible, and we risk losing the deal altogether. 

This offer represents a good balance between getting a favorable price and closing the deal."
