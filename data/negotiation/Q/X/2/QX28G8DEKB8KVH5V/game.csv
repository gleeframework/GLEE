"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go lower than this point.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
