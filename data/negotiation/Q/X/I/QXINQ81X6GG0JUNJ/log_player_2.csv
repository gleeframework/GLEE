"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product for $11,500. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable, and I'm willing to make a compromise on the price to make it a deal you can't refuse. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, getting you a better deal."
