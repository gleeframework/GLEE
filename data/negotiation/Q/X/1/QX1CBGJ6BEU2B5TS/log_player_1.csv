Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially increasing my profit.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a backup who will buy the product for $80, ensuring I don't lose money."
