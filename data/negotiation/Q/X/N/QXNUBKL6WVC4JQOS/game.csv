"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget right now.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to close the deal today at that amount.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
