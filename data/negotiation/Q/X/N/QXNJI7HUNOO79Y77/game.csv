"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still quite a ways off from my initial asking price. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. Would you be willing to consider $1,375,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not willing to go above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,325,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
