Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still quite a ways off from my initial asking price. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. Would you be willing to consider $1,375,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise for both of us.
