Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to consider the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's rarity and potential benefits to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.
