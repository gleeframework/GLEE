"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product,  considering its value to me and your potential profit margin.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering your initial offer and the value I place on this product.  Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and your potential profit. Let's find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and our earlier discussions.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
