Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering your initial offer and the value I place on this product.  Let's find a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll reject the offer and try to push for a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and our earlier discussions.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  At $1,075,000, the price is within my budget and a fair compromise.  Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price."
