Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 20% higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good deal, while still being aware that I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is still a good amount of money, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I believe this is a reasonable price point, considering the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I know the product is worth to him. I don't want to risk a long negotiation that might lead to a lower price. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
