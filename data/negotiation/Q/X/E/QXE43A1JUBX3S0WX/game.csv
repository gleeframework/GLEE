"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to accept $950000. It's significantly lower than my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1050000. This price still allows me to profit while offering you a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $1050000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1000000? This price is within my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
