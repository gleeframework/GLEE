"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to accept $950000. It's significantly lower than my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1050000. This price still allows me to profit while offering you a great deal. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is closer to your maximum budget. However, you can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. You are still willing to pay more than John's offer, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,000,000?
