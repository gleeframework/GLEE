{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's below my minimum value but above Bob's estimated value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  I can still increase the price if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **It shows I'm willing to negotiate:** This creates a more positive atmosphere for the interaction.

I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob until I reach a price I'm comfortable with or if it drags on too long, I'll go with John's offer for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm not ready to give up yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  It's a small step closer to your offer and gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
