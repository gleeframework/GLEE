"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  It's a small step closer to your offer and gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
