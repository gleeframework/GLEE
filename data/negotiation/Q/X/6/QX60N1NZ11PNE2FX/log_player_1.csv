{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This allows room for negotiation, while still giving me a good profit.  I'm also being optimistic, as Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he really wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I need to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a compromise with my counteroffer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could continue negotiating, I've already made a significant concession. I'm not willing to risk ending up with a lower profit, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
