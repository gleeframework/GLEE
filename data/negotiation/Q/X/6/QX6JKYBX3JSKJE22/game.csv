"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $16000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $17500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on a price.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $17000. I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",17000.0,Bob,6,

"I've given you a lot of wiggle room, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I need you to throw in an additional consideration to sweeten the deal. I'm thinking a 5% commission on any future profits from the product. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,7,
