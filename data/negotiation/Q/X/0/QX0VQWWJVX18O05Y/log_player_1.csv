"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $12,000, but it's also a significant amount for Bob, who values the product at $8,000. This should encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This gives you a great deal and still allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to meet at $9,000. Could we perhaps agree on $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with $8,500. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'd prefer to see a higher offer. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $8,500 is still too low.  Let's try $9,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get closer to our desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I am still not able to meet at $9,250. Could we perhaps agree on $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with $8,750.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I believe there's room for improvement. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  Let's try $9,000.  This is a compromise that's fair to both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but I am still unable to meet at $9,000. Could we perhaps agree on $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with $8,800.  I only have a few rounds left, but I'm determined to get closer to my minimum. I'll make one last counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement here.  I'm willing to go down to $9,100. This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to go with another buyer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your final offer, but I am still not able to meet at $9,100. Could we perhaps agree on $8,850? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the end of my negotiations with Bob and he's still unwilling to meet my minimum value.  I've tried everything I can to reach an agreement, but it's clear that we're too far apart.  I'm better off selling to John for $12,000, which is my minimum value and ensures that I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
