"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This gives you a great deal and still allows me to get closer to what I need.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $8,500 is still too low.  Let's try $9,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get closer to our desired price.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
