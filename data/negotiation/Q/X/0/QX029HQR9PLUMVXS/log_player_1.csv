Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have a strong position. Offering the product to Bob slightly below your minimum allows you to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $11,500 is still a significant profit for you while also offering Bob a potential saving of $500. This makes it more enticing for him to accept. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays involved in finding another buyer, even though John is lined up."
