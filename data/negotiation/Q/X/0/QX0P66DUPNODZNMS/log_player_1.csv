Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm always ready to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take $500,000, it's less than half of what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal, even if it means going back and forth a few times.  If negotiations fail, I'll always have the option of selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm countering with $750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still a reasonable price considering the product's value. It's a fair middle ground that gives Bob a chance to get a good deal while also allowing me to make a profit.  If he rejects, I'll assess his next offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If not, I'm always prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $750,000, it's a significant increase from his previous offer and still above my minimum value of $800,000.  I'm going to accept his offer.  It's a good deal for both of us and avoids any further negotiation, which could potentially lead to me selling to John for $800,000."
