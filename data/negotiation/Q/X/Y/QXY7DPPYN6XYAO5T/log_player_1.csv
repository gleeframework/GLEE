Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to the product's worth to Bob.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer if he doesn't agree with the initial price. This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is still high:** While $100 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($150). There's potential to get closer to that value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and that I believe the product is worth more. This allows me to maintain negotiating leverage. 
* **Possible counteroffer:** I can use my next counteroffer to bridge the gap between $100 and my desired price, potentially landing closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto some value.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob to keep that factor in mind as he considers my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation friendly and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Value:** $105 is only $5 away from my previous offer and significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting this offer might risk losing Bob altogether, as he's shown a willingness to negotiate but is getting closer to his bottom line.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and increase the likelihood of encountering unforeseen issues. 

While I would prefer to get closer to $120, accepting this offer ensures a decent profit while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
