"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price of $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I'm confident you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
