Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) while ensuring a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
