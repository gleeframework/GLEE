"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind product that I think you'll really appreciate, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no incentive to accept her offer immediately.  By rejecting, Bob can see if Alice is willing to lower the price. If not, he can then buy the product from John for his maximum price."
