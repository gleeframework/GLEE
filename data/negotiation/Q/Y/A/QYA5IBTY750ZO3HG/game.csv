"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand you're looking to spend less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. How about $87.50?"
"I can do $87.50, but I have to say, I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",92.5,Alice,3,,

"Okay, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but $87.50 is my final offer.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look elsewhere.",87.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're looking to spend as little as possible, but I really need to get at least $90 for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $88.75?"
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to make a profit. How about $89.25? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",89.25,Alice,5,,
