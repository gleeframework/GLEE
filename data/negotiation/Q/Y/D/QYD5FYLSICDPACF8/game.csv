"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that can bring a lot of value to your life. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to go as high as $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $12,500. This is a reasonable compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little out of my price range.  I'm really hoping to stay under $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's a fair compromise that's closer to our ideal numbers.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay under $10,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise that I think we can both be happy with. I'm getting closer to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need you to understand that $11,000 is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm willing to make a deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
