Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. I'm willing to go no lower than this price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers again, which would be $1,316,250. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,316,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,316,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is very unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $1,316,250 is a good deal considering your minimum price is $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks him walking away."
