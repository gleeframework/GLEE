"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than Alice's initial value of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to his maximum price point while still leaving room for negotiation.  Offering $85 is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to send another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $85. He's shown that he's willing to negotiate and has already moved from his initial desired price point.  He's hoping that Alice will realize that she needs to meet him halfway to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $95 is still above his maximum of $80. Bob is determined to save as much as possible and should continue negotiating.  He has a backup option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to send another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice he's serious about purchasing the product but still trying to keep the price down. He's hoping to reach a compromise at $90, which is closer to Alice's price but within his maximum budget.  The message emphasizes his desire to close the deal and create a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  There are only three rounds left, and Bob has a reliable alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for $80.  It's unlikely that Alice will drop her price to $80 in the next three rounds.  Therefore, Bob should choose the guaranteed deal with John to secure the product at the best possible price."
