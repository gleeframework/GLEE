"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth the same to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $8,000, so there's no pressure. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,1,
