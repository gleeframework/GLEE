Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
