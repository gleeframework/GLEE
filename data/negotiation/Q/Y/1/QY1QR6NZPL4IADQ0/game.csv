"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my budget. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,075,000 is my absolute bottom line. It allows me to recover a significant portion of the value and still makes this a good deal for you.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
