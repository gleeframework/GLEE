"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you, and I've tailored my offer with that in mind. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower her price to make the sale. 
* **Stick with John:** You have John as a backup who is selling at your absolute maximum price. 

There's room for negotiation here before resorting to buying from John."
