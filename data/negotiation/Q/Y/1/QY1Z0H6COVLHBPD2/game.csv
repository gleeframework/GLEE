"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $825,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable at that price. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
