"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high initial value for the product. I'm confident in the value of the product and want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm willing to compromise but I'm not willing to give up the value of the product entirely.  I'm hoping this offer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not ready to settle for such a low price. I will counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can encourage Bob to raise his offer further.  I believe there is still room for negotiation and I'm determined to get a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering $1,500,000. This is my minimum price, as it's the amount I would receive from John. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my offer. If he rejects, I will sell to John to avoid losing further time and potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I don't want to risk losing more time in negotiation and potentially receiving a lower offer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and allows me to move on."
