"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come out ahead.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come out ahead.",875000.0,Alice,3,
