I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $110 isn't ideal, it's getting close to my minimum and we're running out of time. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing both Bob and John."
