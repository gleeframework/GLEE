Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 7

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer for the following reasons:

* **Alice is at her bottom line:** Alice knows the product is worth $800,000 to her and is unlikely to go any lower. She's already indicated a willingness to meet in the middle multiple times. 
* **Significant savings:** You're still getting a $200,000 discount compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks Alice walking away or becoming firmer in her position.

It's a strong deal at this point, and holding out for a slightly better price isn't worth the risk of losing the opportunity."
