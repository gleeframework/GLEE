"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this incredible product, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $825,000 and $750,000. How about we try $787,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",787500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer, but $787,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. To be honest, I have a hard limit at $775,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is your hard limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $775,000 again. How about we try $800,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what you would have to pay elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,7,
