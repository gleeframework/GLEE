"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about $120 for the product?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and understanding. $130 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more for this product. How about $135?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",135.0,Alice,5,
