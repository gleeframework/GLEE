Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a chance to maximize my profit. I'm confident that Bob will at least consider this offer, and I'm prepared to counter-offer if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I want to earn for the product. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $875,000, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still being  closer to my desired price point. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to pay a price close to my desired value. To avoid further delays and potential losses, it's best to accept the guaranteed $800,000 offer from John."
