"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you further in the middle, but I can only go as high as $950,000.  This would allow both of us to make a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we compromise. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly.",975000.0,Bob,6,
