"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and go with $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle and go with $132.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant at $132.50. How about we settle at $128? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $128. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $131? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product!",131.0,Alice,5,
