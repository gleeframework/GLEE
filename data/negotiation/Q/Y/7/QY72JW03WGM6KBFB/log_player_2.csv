"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  $100 is still a bit high for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $92.50 is still a bit high, and he can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference - how about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
