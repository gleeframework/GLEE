"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $14,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'd still find it a great deal.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $13,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15,000.",13000.0,Bob,6,
