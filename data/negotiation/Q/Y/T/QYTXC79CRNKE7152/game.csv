"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,600,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise we both agree on.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
