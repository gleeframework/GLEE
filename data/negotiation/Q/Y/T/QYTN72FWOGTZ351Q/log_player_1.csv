"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, so there's still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $825,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I have more rounds to negotiate.  $787,500 is closer to my goal, but I believe I can still get a better offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $787,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference again. How about $806,250?  That's a fair compromise and will allow both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 806250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $806,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $793,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $793,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $793,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $793,750 is getting closer to what I'd like to sell for, I'm still hoping to get closer to $800,000. I have 4 rounds left, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand your position, but $793,750 isn't quite enough for me. How about $798,125?  That's a very small difference, and I'm willing to meet you there."", ""product_price"": 798125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $798,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the closest I can get to your price without going over my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $795,000 is very close to my target price of $800,000, and I only have two rounds left.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
