"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $2,025,000? This reflects its true value while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $2,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,912,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to continue the negotiation for a couple more rounds to see if I can push closer to $2 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,912,500 is a little too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to consider $1,975,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1,925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $2 million, Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much higher.  Accepting his offer of $1,925,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
