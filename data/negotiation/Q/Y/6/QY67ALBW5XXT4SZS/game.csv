"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not comfortable going any higher.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to see some movement from your side.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's the best price I can offer at this point. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000 is too high, so I'll meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,7,
