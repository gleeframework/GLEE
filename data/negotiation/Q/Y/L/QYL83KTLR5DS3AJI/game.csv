"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000? This reflects a more agreeable middle ground.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a fair compromise, and it's the maximum I can offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
