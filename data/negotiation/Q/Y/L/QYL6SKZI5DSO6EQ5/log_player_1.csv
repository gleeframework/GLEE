Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This allows for negotiation while still securing a decent profit.  I've included a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000 to make this work. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 820000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000 at this point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
