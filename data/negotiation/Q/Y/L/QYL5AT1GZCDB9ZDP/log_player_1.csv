Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to see if he's seriously interested in the product and willing to pay a premium."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
