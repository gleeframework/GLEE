"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $850000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for this valuable product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your proposal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $825000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this valuable product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
