Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price before I have to consider selling to John."
