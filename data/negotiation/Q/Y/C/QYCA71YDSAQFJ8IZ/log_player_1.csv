""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I have another buyer interested at a higher price. Let me know your decision soon!"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, her guaranteed sale price from John.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 helps set the upper limit of the offer.
* **Negotiation Power:**  Alice has a strong position because she has a guaranteed buyer. This allows her to push for a higher price.

**The offer of $1,150,000 aims to:**

* **Leave room for Bob to profit:**  Bob could still potentially profit if he finds a way to leverage the product beyond his initial $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Maximize Alice's profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice earns significantly more than selling to John. 

**The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach:**

* **Creates urgency:**  This encourages Bob to decide quickly without trying to negotiate down the price.
* **Reinforces Alice's position:** It emphasizes that Alice has other options and is not desperate for a sale."
