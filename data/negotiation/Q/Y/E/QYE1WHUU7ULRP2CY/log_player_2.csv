Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850000 is a bit lower than where I need to be on this deal. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price still allows me to make a profit while ensuring we both have a positive outcome. I'm confident this product will be a strong addition to your operations, and I'm eager to reach an agreement.
