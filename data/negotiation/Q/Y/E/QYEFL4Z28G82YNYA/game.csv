"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,
