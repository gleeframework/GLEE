"That's a good starting point, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? That's still a fair price for you, and a good deal for me. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit higher than your last offer, so I'm willing to compromise.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my spending limit. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
