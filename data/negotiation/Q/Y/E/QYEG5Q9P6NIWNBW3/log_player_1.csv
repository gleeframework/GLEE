{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $150 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $130 is higher than $80, giving Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $130 is less than your minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $130 is a fair price that allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, you set the stage for a productive negotiation while also ensuring you don't sell yourself short."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, so I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm happy to lower the price to $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $120 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum value of $150, so I'm not losing money on the deal.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone can help maintain a good rapport with Bob during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $115. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my minimum value of $150, it's still below what I'd like to get. I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, so I'm not going to accept a lower price just yet. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $115 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $118. That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** Offering $118 shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to give up too much.
* **Staying above minimum:** $118 is still above my minimum value of $150, but getting closer to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value can help justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $118, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $80. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that I'm comfortable with. It's clear that we are far apart on price, and it's unlikely that we will reach an agreement.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, it's the best decision to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
