"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. This is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it leaves room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is still a good margin for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to consider, given his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is still far too low for me, and I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $140. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to be able to get a price that's worth my time. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
