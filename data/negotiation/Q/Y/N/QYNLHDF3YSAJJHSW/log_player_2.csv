"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  You can likely get a better price than $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
``` 

This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down in price, but it's still worth trying to get a lower price.  You can likely get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you're willing to compromise, but still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could continue to counteroffer, the negotiations seem to be getting stuck around this price point. Buying from Alice for $550,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000."
