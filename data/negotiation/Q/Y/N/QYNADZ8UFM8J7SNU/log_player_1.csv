Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you consider $9,000? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has come down to $8,000, which matches what John is offering. There's no point in continuing negotiations as it's unlikely Bob will go higher, and we risk losing both offers. Taking John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
