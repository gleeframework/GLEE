``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also framing it as a good deal for Bob, highlighting its potential benefit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which I think is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to hold out for a better offer, or sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
