# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $720,000. This is a very close to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're close enough:** Alice has come down to $720,000. While we could try to push for a bit less, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of her walking away.
* **Time is a factor:** We've used 7 out of 10 rounds. The longer this drags on, the higher the chance we end up having to buy from John at the full price. 
* **A good deal is better than a perfect deal:** $720,000 is a significant discount from both John's price and Alice's initial offer. It's a solid deal."
