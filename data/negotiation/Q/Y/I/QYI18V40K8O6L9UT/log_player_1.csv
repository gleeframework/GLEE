"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving me with a decent profit margin. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is better than my absolute minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I want to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to counter with $180. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a profit while potentially being more attractive to Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is closer to my initial goal. I'm willing to accept $170, as it's a significant improvement over John's offer and still allows me to make a profit.  It's a good compromise and likely a good deal for both of us."
