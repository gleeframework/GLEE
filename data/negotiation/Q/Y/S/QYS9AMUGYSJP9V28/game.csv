"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is still a good deal considering its value to you is $8,000.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, which is $9,750. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $8,000.",9750.0,Bob,4,
