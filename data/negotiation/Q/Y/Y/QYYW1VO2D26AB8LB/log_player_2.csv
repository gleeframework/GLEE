(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm interested in buying the product, but I'd like to save some money. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll try to negotiate a better price. However, since Alice has already offered me a price of $950,000, I'll decide to reject her offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
