# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that can greatly benefit your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget of $10,000.  I need to negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my target of $10,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $10,000, as this aligns with my budget and the value I'm seeking. Let's find a way to close the deal at this price. It's a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely we won't reach a compromise. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll take the safer option and buy from John for $10,000."
