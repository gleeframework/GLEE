"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I'm seeking, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $10,000, as this aligns with my budget and the value I'm seeking. Let's find a way to close the deal at this price. It's a fair value for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
