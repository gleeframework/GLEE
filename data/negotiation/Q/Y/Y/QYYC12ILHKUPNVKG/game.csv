"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate the value of your product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This offer reflects the value you'll gain while acknowledging your initial offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This would give you a good return while allowing me to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to find a solution, $10,000 is still too low for me to accept.  My final offer is $12,500. This is a firm price, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
