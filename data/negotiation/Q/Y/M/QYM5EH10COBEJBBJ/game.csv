"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $700,000. I'm offering you the product for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",725000.0,Alice,5,
