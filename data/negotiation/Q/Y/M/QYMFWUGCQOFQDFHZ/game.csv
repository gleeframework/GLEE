"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider the value of this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another option.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I've already met you halfway twice, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $825,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
