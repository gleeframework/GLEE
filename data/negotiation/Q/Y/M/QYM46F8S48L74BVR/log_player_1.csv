"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Given your expressed budget constraint, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000. This still provides a substantial margin for you to profit from the product, and it's a more reasonable starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have a backup offer from John for $1,500,000, and I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. How about we split the difference?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for your product. I believe this strikes a balance between your needs and mine. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with the price.  I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, but I'm aware I'm running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price point.  I have only two rounds left and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price than I can potentially get from Bob. I'm going to try one last counteroffer to see if I can get him up to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to lower my price one last time to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  If you're unable to accept, I'll have to move forward with my alternative offer, which is unfortunately less favorable for you.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 10
Bob's offer:

This is my last round, and although Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price point.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not as high as I'd hoped, it guarantees me a good profit and secures the sale."
