"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I have no immediate need to buy from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to sell for less, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $80, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $100. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my value of $100, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counter-offer.  It's important to continue trying to lower the price as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $90. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still trying to save money.  I'm aiming for a gradual approach, hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
