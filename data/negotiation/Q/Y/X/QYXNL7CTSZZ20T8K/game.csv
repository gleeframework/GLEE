"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on it, while giving you a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows me to acquire the product within my budget, and it still gives you a healthy profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
