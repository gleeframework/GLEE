"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to counter with an offer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a revised price of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I recognize the value of this product, $825,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $775,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a revised price of $800,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
