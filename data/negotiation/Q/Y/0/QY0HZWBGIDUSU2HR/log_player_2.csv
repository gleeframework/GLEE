"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still quite high, given that the product is worth $800,000 to her.  We can likely negotiate a better price. There's no point in buying from John for $1,500,000 when we can potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to counter with an offer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a revised price of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign. However, $825,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to get closer to my ideal price point. Buying from John is still a much worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I recognize the value of this product, $825,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $775,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a revised price of $800,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price of $800,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000 and he's been able to negotiate a price that is $700,000 lower.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal, especially with John's higher price as a backup option."
