"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120) but still above what the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  A $10 difference between my offer and my minimum price gives Bob some room to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price by rejecting this offer and counter-offering. 
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $100?  That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language (""good deal for both of us"") to maintain a friendly tone.
* **Still Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's a significant concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since I have the safety net of selling to John for $120.
* **Counter-Offering:**  I believe I can get a slightly better price by counter-offering one last time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last concession, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Close to Minimum:**  $98 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, making it a more enticing offer for Bob. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is straightforward and focused on getting Bob to accept.
* **Negotiation Pressure:**  By setting a final offer, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $98, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concessions Exhausted:** Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I've already made several concessions. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and ultimately ending up with a price lower than my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation that might not result in a favorable outcome."
