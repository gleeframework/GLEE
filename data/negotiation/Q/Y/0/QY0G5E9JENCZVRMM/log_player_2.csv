Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach.

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd be willing to pay, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. She might not go any lower, and I'd rather secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
