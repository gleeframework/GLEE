"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm thinking, it's still a bit too high. How about we settle at $700,000? That would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach.",750000.0,Alice,5,
