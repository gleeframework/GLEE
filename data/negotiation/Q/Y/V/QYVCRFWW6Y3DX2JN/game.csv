"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to meet my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am unable to proceed with an offer higher than $800,000 at this time. I hope we can continue our discussion at a later date when my financial situation might allow for a higher investment.",800000.0,Bob,4,
