Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me a good profit while potentially leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, but I will always have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could sell to John for $100,  I'd rather try to get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. It's still a good price for me, and it might be more attractive to Bob than his previous offer. If he still refuses, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $80 is still below my preferred price, it's closer to John's offer.  Since Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, I'll accept his offer to avoid further rounds and potentially lose out on a sale entirely."
