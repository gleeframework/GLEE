"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I think it's definitely worth the price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, as I can get a similar product from another seller for $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you can find a similar product elsewhere, but this one has some unique features that you might not find in others. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9250.0,Alice,3,
