"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I think it's definitely worth the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less from John, and there's no need to risk paying more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you can find a similar product elsewhere, but this one has some unique features that you might not find in others. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and the risk of paying more than he's comfortable with isn't worth it.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
