"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6,000 is too low for me, considering the value of this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
