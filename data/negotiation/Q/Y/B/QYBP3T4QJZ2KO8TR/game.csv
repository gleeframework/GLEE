"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $14,250.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price for the value of the product. If we can agree on this, we can both get a good deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
