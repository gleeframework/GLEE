"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8500? It's still a great price for a product worth so much to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
