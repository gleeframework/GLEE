Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($15,000) allows room for negotiation.  It also tests Bob's eagerness and gives you a sense of his willingness to pay.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite Bob's perspective and potential counter-offers. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob.**
2. **If Bob rejects the offer, you still have the guaranteed sale to John at $12,000.**"
