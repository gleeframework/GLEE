"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,15000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. $14,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,13000.0
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,12500.0
"Hi Bob, I see you're really close to the value you put on the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $12,750. This is the last time I can adjust the price, so let me know if this works for you.",12750.0,Alice,7,,
