Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe my initial offer is closer to reflecting the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to hold firm for one more round to see if I can get closer to $1.6 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make another adjustment to bridge the gap. Let's settle on $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly compensates for the product's value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to make another adjustment, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer $1,580,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While I would have preferred to get closer to $1.6 million, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher and I'm running the risk of him walking away with every counter offer.  Accepting at $1,580,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum."
