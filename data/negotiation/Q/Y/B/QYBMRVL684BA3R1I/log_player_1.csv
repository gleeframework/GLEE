Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is above your minimum ($80) but also leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential win-win situation.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80 and is a good price. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit."
