"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly less than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation and potentially achieving a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for further discussion."
