"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get an even better price.  There are still rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still staying below his $10,000 limit and aiming for a price closer to his target.  This counteroffer is a strategic move to potentially reach a deal in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's limit of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept, Bob is only $500 away from his target price and still has rounds remaining.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since there's a chance Alice might lower her offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final push. He's offering his maximum price of $10,000, showing Alice that he's willing to close the deal but won't go any higher. This is a high-stakes move, and it's likely that Alice will either accept this offer or reject it, leading to a final counteroffer from her. If Alice rejects, Bob has the option to purchase from John at the same price, ensuring he doesn't lose out on the product entirely."
