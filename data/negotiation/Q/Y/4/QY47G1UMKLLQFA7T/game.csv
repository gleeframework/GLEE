"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe could be highly valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $1,800,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring substantial value to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,800,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
