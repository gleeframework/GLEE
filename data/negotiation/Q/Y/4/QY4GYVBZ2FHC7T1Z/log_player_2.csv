# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling finality:** Her language (""This is my final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Savings are significant:** You'll be buying the product for $500 less than John's price and $1,500 less than her initial offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you push further and Alice is serious about her final offer, you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
