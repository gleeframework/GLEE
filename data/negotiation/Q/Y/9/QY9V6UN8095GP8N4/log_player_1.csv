Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's value is $800,000, Alice holds a strong position with John as a backup buyer. Starting with a price closer to her minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourage a counter-offer from Bob, opening a dialogue. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob while still securing a guaranteed sale with John if needed."
