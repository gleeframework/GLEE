"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $900000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $650000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering our desired outcomes. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $750000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $700000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be sure I'm getting the best possible deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I'm still a bit far from meeting your target.
