"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable concession, and I believe it reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant opportunity for you.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
