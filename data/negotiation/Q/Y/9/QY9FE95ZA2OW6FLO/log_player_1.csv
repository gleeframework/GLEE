"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable concession, and I believe it reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below John's offer. We have room to negotiate and see if we can push Bob closer to the $1,500,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant opportunity for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not significantly increasing his offer and is unlikely to reach the $1,500,000 mark. Cutting our losses and selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
