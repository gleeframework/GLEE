"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I believe this price is reasonable and might encourage Bob to come closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slight improvement, it's still too far below my desired value. I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob, as I have more time and rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and also the price I can get from John. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting this price and I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't meet it."
