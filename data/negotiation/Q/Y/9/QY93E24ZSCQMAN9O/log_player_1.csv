"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for your flexibility. While I value the product, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $14,000. While we could counteroffer, we already have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed higher offer."
