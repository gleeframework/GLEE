"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $13000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,6,
