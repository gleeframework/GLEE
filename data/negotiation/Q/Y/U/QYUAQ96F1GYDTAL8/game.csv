"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $850,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
