"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $850,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  While $850,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $820,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",820000.0,Alice,5,
