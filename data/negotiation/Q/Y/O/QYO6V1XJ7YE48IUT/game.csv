"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $950,000 is too low for me. Considering the value of the product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
