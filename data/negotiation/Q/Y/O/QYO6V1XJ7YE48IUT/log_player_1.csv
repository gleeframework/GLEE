Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still a good deal for Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. It's higher than his perceived value, but below my minimum.
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a win for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer gives Bob space to counter, keeping the negotiation open. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is an option:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, I want to maximize my profit. I'm willing to risk continued negotiation with Bob to see if I can secure a higher price. 

I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $950,000 is too low for me. Considering the value of the product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my minimum:** I'm moving closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 but still offering a potential deal for Bob. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Compromise and win-win:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise to show flexibility while still maintaining a profitable deal for myself.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll evaluate his next offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
