"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance you can get the product for less than $1,000,000 and still save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $950,000 is too low for me. Considering the value of the product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to your target, it's not worth risking further negotiation. John is offering the product at your maximum budget, so it's the safest and most efficient option to purchase from him."
