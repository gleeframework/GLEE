Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something I value highly, but I believe it could be even more beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob's value is $10,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we start high to test his willingness to pay. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, allowing for a potential compromise that's still highly profitable for you.
* **Justification for price:** By stating you value the product highly, you create a perceived justification for the high price without revealing your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and you accepting the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
