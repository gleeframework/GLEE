"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  This product has tremendous value, and I believe a fairer price would be $1,275,000. This still offers you a substantial return on your investment.
