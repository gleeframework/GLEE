Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
