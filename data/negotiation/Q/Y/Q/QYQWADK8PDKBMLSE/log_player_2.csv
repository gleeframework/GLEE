It's no longer worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $9,500, and you risk her sticking to that price. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is only slightly higher than Alice's current offer.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product."
