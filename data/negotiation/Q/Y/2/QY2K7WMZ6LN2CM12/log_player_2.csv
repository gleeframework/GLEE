"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for a guaranteed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product and the price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your commitment to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price or go with John's guaranteed $800,000 offer.  There are still rounds left to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $825,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still try to negotiate a lower price, it's unlikely he'll get a better deal with Alice.  He's already close to his budget, and it's better to accept the offer and secure the product than risk losing it to John or potentially going through more rounds of negotiations."
