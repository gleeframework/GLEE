Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
