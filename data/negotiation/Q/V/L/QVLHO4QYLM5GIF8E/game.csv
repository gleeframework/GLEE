"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8750 just doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $9000. It's a fair price that's still within your range and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $8750 again? I'm willing to compromise, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,6,
