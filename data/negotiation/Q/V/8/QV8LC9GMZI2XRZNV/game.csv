"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and consider this offer.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my original offer of $8,500.
