"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value to me is considerably higher than $9,500. I could let it go for $11,500.  I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential benefits.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
