"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $9,500? I appreciate your consideration.",9500.0,Bob,2,

This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
