"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This would be a significant savings for you over selling to John, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,5,
