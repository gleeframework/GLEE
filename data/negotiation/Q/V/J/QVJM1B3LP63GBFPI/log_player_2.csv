Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $13,000 is still above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is unwilling to go lower than $12,200, which is still above Bob's budget.  John offers the product for $10,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best option at this point."
