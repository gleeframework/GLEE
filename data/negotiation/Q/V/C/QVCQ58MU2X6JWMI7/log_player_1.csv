{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Strategic Lower Bound:** While I value the product at $150, I'm willing to go lower than that initially to see if Bob is interested. I'll adjust based on his response. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it signals that he is interested in the product. I believe I can still negotiate a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $120 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than his initial proposal.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" Bob will still get at $120, encouraging him to consider my offer.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer is a good middle ground that allows for potential agreement while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still pushing for a higher price, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a Final Counteroffer:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, and I don't want to risk selling too low.
* **Assessing Risk:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome. However, rejecting Bob's offer and making a final counteroffer presents a potential for a better outcome, but also a risk of losing the deal entirely. 

**Next Steps:**  I will make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the remaining gap. If he rejects, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to make one last compromise.  $115 is my final offer.  This is a great price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach an agreement, moving slightly closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Urgency and Enthusiasm:**  I'm using phrases like ""final offer"" and ""make this deal happen"" to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Framing:**  I highlight that this price is ""great for both of us,"" emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement.
* **Risk Management:** While this offer is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum to be worthwhile if Bob accepts.  If he rejects, I'll sell to John, minimizing my potential loss."
