"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This offer still gives you a great deal at $100,000 less than its true value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",800000.0,Bob,4,
