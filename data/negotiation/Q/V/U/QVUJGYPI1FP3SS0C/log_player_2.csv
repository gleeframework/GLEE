We're getting closer to the target price. By continuing to make small, gradual counteroffers, we can slowly bring Alice down to our desired price point. It's important to be patient and persistent in negotiations, as Alice will likely try to hold out for a higher price."

* **Alice's offer is final.**  She has stated that this is her final offer.  Trying to negotiate further could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **You have a backup option.**  You can still purchase the product from John for $1,200,000. This gives you a safety net if you choose not to accept Alice's offer.
