Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum.
* **First-mover Advantage:**  By emphasizing Bob has the first chance to buy, you create a sense of urgency and potential loss if he rejects. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. While there's a chance Bob rejects the $15,000, you still have John as a safety net."
