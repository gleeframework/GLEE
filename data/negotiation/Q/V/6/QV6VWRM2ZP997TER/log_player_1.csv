# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?
