"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll meet you at $915000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",915000.0,Alice,5,
