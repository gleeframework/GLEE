,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'd be willing to accept $1,275,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while recognizing your budget concerns.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
