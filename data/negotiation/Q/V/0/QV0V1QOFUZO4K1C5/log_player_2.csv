Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000. It's a fair price that considers your needs and my value for the product. What do you say?

You're still looking to save as much money as possible.  You're closer to your desired price range, but rejecting again lets you continue to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value our ongoing discussion, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product. Let's finalize this agreement.

You've reached a point where the price is still higher than your desired maximum of $800,000.  Even though you've been able to negotiate with Alice, it's clear she's not going to go any lower. You're better off buying from John at this point and saving $200,000."
