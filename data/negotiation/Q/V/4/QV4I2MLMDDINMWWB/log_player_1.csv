Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Starting close to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appeal to Value:**  While the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, suggesting it ""offers significant value"" might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Negotiation Window:** Offering a price slightly below your minimum with John leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** By subtly implying you have other buying options (""happy to discuss further...""), you create a sense of urgency and competition for Bob."
