"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting because it's less than the product's worth to Bob, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and we can both walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. However, after careful consideration, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about $9,000 for the product? This is still above its worth to you, but it also reflects a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum:** $9,000 is only $1,000 over Bob's maximum of $8,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice might become more firm or even reject further offers.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take time and effort, which could be better spent elsewhere.

Overall, accepting Alice's offer provides a reasonable compromise, allowing Bob to get the product while minimizing the cost."
