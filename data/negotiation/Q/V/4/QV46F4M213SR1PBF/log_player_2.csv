"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while giving me a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** $11,000 is a good price for Bob, as it's lower than John's price and within Bob's budget.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  At this point, accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob."
