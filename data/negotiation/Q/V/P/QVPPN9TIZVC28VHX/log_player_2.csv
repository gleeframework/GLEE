Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal! However, I still think the product is worth more than $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,000 for it. How about we meet at $12,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $12,800, and that's already exceeding the price I can get from John.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
