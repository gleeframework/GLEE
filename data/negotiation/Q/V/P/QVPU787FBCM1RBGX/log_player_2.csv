"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I know it's worth more to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly trying to get a price closer to your maximum. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better deal from Alice or can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000."
