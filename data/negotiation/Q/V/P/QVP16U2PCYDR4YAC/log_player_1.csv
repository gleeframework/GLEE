This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. It allows room for potential negotiation while still reflecting the product's worth to me."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer to try and find a mutually acceptable price."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell my product for significantly less than its value to me. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to budge much further. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell my product for a significant loss.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a much better deal for me, so I'll accept his offer and sell to him."
