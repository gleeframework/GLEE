Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal and worth the price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I want a high price, starting at $150 leaves no room for Bob to counter-offer. $149 allows for a potential negotiation where Bob might feel he's getting a small concession.
* **Avoid a Stalemate:**  If I price too high, Bob will definitely refuse, and I'll lose the opportunity to make more than $150. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
