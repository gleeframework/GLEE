You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.** This means there's no immediate benefit to accepting it.
* **You don't know Alice's true value for the product.** This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price.**  

By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility of a counteroffer from Alice. If Alice is willing to drop the price, you could save some money. If not, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is at the very top of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This would allow me to secure the product while still staying within my financial constraints. Please let me know if this price works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is significantly lower:** This shows your intention to negotiate and creates space for a potential compromise. 
* **The counteroffer is still reasonable:**  You're not lowballing her, leaving room for her to accept. 
* **You justify your offer:**  You explain your reasoning, making the counteroffer less arbitrary and potentially more persuasive."
