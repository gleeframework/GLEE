"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle on something closer to $1,000,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can still sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer just yet. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  That feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while working for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target.  I'm not yet ready to accept a price below $1,200,000, especially since I have several rounds remaining and can always sell to John for that amount. I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  However, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,175,000, which is a significant concession.  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?  It seems like we're both interested in making this deal happen, and that feels like a price point where we both win. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal, but Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could continue negotiating, I'm now at a point where I'm comfortable selling to John. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum requirement, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
