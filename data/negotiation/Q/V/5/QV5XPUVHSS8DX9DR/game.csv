"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle on something closer to $1,000,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  That feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while working for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  However, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,175,000, which is a significant concession.  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?  It seems like we're both interested in making this deal happen, and that feels like a price point where we both win.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
