"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7800 is still a little low for me. How about we settle on $8000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
