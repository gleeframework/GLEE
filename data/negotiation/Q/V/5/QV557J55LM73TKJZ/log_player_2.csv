"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a unique item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his maximum budget, and he can do better. There's no reason to accept this offer, especially since he has the option to buy from John for much cheaper."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way too high. I'm interested in the product but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  How about I offer you $8,000 for it? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He's determined to get it for $8,000 and has a fallback option with John.  There's no need to accept yet, especially since there are rounds left.  He can keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact I have another offer for the same product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your commitment to $8,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to make a slightly smaller concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  He's sticking to his $8,000 budget and he has a safe alternative with John.  He's only halfway through the rounds, so he has plenty of time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me and the other offer I have. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above his budget. He's already made it clear that he's sticking to $8,000, and Alice is unlikely to change her mind. With only three rounds left, he's better off taking the sure thing with John.  There's no guarantee Alice will agree to his offer, and there's a risk of ending up with nothing if the negotiation fails."
