"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,100,000 is significantly outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. To move forward, I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my own valuation. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise.  $975,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which I believe is a fair and realistic price for both of us. This demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal, let's see if we can find common ground.",925000.0,Bob,6,
