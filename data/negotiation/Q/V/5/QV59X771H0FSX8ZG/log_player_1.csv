Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
