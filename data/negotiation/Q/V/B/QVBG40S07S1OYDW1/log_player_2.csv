"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's no harm in rejecting the first offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible. While $108 is closer to his target, he can likely still get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $106?"", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $109? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $109, which is very close to Bob's target price of $105.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there is a risk that Alice will walk away or that Bob will run out of rounds and have to buy from John at $120.  Accepting the offer at $109 secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
