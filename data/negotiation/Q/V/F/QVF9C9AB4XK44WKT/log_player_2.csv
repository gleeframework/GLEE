"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15500.  Let me know if you're interested!   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering the product for $15,500.  Since you can get the same product from John for your maximum price, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
