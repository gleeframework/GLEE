"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $875,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000, but it's significantly closer. 
* Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal to another buyer.
* Accepting the offer at $875,000 allows Bob to secure the product while still saving a considerable amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
