"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $110? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $110. I would like to stick to my original offer of $100. Thank you for considering my position.",100.0,Bob,4,
