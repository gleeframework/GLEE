Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $950,000 for it. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob and see if we can come to a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

This is a good deal for me. While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer is only $50,000 less than John's offer and it saves me time and the risk of further negotiations."
