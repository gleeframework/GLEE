"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $12000. This is the lowest I can go.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for the product.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you a price of $11000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
