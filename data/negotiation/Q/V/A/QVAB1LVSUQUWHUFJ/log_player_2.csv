You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100 and even higher than John's offer of $100. You're much better off going with John."
