Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price."
