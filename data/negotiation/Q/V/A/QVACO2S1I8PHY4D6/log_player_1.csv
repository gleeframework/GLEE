Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price and I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
