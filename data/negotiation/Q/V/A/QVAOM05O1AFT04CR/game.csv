"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you at $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  This would allow me to acquire the product within my budget, while also giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",10500.0,Alice,5,
