Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $130 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150 value - $130 price = $20 perceived gain). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
