I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to counter with a lower price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price that demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, while still securing a profit above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is very close to my initial counteroffer, and it's a significant profit over my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
