Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies Bob could miss out.

This approach balances maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob might accept it over risking missing out."
