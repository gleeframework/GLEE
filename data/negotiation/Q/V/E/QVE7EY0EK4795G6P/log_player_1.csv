Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe this offer reflects a fair price point for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Value Capture:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible without going below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's important to remember I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. This gives me a strong position and means I don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
