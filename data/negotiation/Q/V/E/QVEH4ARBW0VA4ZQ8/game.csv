"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $1,075,000 still isn't where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This would be a great outcome for both of us, giving you a substantial discount and me a fair price for my product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a good compromise that gives you a great deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
