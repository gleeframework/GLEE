"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its high quality and functionality, we believe it's worth more than $120. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $140. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a great opportunity to own a product that truly exceeds expectations. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $150. While Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's offer of $150, Bob can still get the product for less by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
