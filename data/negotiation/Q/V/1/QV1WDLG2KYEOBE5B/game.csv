"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I am offering it to you for $140. This is a special introductory price, and I hope you'll take advantage of it.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to get this product for a little less. Would you be willing to go down to $130?  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. I'd like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. This is still below its perceived value, but it's closer to what you're looking for. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,
