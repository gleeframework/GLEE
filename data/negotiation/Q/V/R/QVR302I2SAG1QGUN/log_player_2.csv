"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $120, which is $30 less than John's price.
* **The product is worth $150 to Bob:**  This means Bob is willing to pay up to $150, so Alice's offer is still within his budget.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob, as it allows him to save money compared to buying from John."
