Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower price, or even having the deal fall through entirely. Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price."
