"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

Bob offers $750,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer and within his budget. This is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $850,000 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better price. By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice and see if he can push her down further towards his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should counteroffer $800,000. This is his maximum budget, and he can get the product for this price from John if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice.  This puts the pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale altogether."
