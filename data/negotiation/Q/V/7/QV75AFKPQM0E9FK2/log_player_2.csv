"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $200. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150, which is fair considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
