{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. It leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to pay closer to your desired price.  I'm aiming for a compromise, knowing I can always go to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $950000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is more than Bob initially offered, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm not desperate for a quick sale, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to consider $1000000 as a potential price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you're offering. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's more than Bob's initial offer, and it's a reasonable price for the value of the product.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John, who is offering my absolute minimum."
