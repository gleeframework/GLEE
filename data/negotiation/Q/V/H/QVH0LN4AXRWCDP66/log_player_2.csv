"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $15,000.** 
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate.**  You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a lower offer:**  You're aiming for a price below your $15,000 maximum, so starting at $10,500 gives room for negotiation.
* **Be polite and professional:**  It's important to maintain a good relationship with Alice, even when negotiating. 
* **Don't reveal your maximum:**  You haven't told Alice your absolute limit, giving you leverage."

* **There's still room for negotiation:** You have more rounds, and you can likely get a lower price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming to stay under my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? This would allow us both to reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stay close to your target:** You're now within $500 of your ideal price.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  Show Alice that you're still interested in buying the product.
