Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's estimated value.  
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and inviting Bob to discuss it. I'm not being aggressive, but I'm also not giving away too much. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential:** This starting point gives me room to negotiate down if Bob rejects.  
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not giving away the farm, but I'm also leaving the door open for a deal. 
* **Secure Backup:**  I can always go to John for my minimum value if Bob is not willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  While I could potentially negotiate further with Bob, it's unlikely I'll be able to reach a satisfactory price.  

**Reasons for Rejection:**

* **Too Low:** $600,000 is a substantial drop from my initial offer, and it's clear Bob is trying to lowball me. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could drag on and ultimately result in a deal that's not profitable for me. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 provides a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of extended negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. However, I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value you'll get from this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial price of $1,000,000. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value Bob will receive.
* **Openness:** I'm expressing a willingness to find common ground, keeping the negotiation open.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not accepting Bob's lowball offer, but I'm also not immediately going to John. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This counteroffer will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also have a bottom line. 
* **Prepare for Potential Deal:**  If Bob is truly interested, this counteroffer might be a good starting point for a final deal. 

**Note:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $725,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not a good deal for me.  

* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  Bob is clearly interested, and I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Accepting $725,000 might lead to a quick deal, but it could also signal that I'm willing to settle for less, which could potentially weaken my negotiating position in the future. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 remains the safer option, as it guarantees a profitable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. However, I will carefully consider whether the potential gains from further negotiation outweigh the risks. I'm still prepared to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob continue to be unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get. This is my final offer. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this as my final offer, putting the ball firmly in Bob's court. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm compromising by going down to $800,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to be reasonable.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he will receive from the product, hoping to encourage him to see the value in my final offer.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Close the Gap:** This offer closes the gap between our positions significantly, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Finality:**  Stating it's my final offer creates urgency and pressure on Bob to decide. 
* **Preparation for Exit:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on to John and secure my minimum value. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm confident that this final offer will be appealing to Bob. However, I'm ready to sell to John if Bob rejects the offer."
