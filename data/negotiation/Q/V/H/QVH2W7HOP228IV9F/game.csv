"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which would give you a decent profit.  Let's try to close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $120 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This would be a win-win for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $120, which is still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",120.0,Bob,6,
