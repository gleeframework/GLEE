Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial price is a reflection of the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we risk losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John if we continue haggling. It's better to take the sure profit now."
