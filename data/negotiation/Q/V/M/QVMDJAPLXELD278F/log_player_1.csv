"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $8,750 at this point. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to $9,000 with another counteroffer. I have a few rounds left, so I'm not going to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
