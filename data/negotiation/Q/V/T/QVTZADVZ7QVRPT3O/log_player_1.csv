{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum price ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate if needed.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value for Bob. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can then adjust my price or potentially consider John's offer of $150 depending on how much I want to keep negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150.** I'm not willing to sell for less than that, even though I'm currently in a negotiation with Bob. 
* **I'm choosing to reject his offer and continue negotiating.** This gives me the opportunity to potentially get a higher price from Bob or to secure the $150 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $120. This is a compromise - it's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone, reiterating the value for Bob while also making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Strategic Thinking:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I have a limit. This could lead to a deal, or it could push Bob to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $90 is still well below my minimum price of $150. 
* I've already made a concession to $120 and Bob rejected it. It's clear we're too far apart in our valuations.
* John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is significantly better than anything I can realistically get from Bob at this point. 
* Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John to maximize my profit."
