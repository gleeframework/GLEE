"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you do $17,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
