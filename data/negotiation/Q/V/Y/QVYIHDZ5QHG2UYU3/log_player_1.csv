"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think it's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $10,750. This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but $10,750 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I think the product will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $10,250 is a good price and it's close enough to my minimum.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000."
