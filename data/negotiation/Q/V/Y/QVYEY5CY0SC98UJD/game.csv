"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I believe this product is worth every bit of $19,000, I'm willing to come down slightly to $18,500. This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.",18500.0,Alice,5,
