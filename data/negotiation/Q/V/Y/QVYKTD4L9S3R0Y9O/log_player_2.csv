Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with the $9000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10500? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.
