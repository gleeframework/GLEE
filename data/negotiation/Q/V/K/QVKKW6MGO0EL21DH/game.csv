"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and offer it to you for $1,012,500. This is the best compromise I can make, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
