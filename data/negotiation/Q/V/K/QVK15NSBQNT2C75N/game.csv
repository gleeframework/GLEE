"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is still a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
