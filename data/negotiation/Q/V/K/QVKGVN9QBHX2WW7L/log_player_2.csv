"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you.  I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its significant value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my ideal target.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price.  I have 10 rounds, so I have time to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to its true value.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I can still try to negotiate lower. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise. There's still time left in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that lets us both walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
