"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer but still holding firm on a price that's fair to me. I believe this price is reasonable enough for Bob to consider, while still giving me a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of time,  $85 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product for $100. This is my minimum price and I'm not willing to go lower. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to sell to John if he doesn't."
