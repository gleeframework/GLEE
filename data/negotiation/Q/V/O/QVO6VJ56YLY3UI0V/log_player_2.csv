# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer it to you at this price again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
