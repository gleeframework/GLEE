Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him room to negotiate while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  This allows for a potential win-win scenario where I can get a good price and Bob feels like he got a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept given that it's above his perceived value, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show flexibility. I believe $14,000 is still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable price and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $13,200 is getting too close to my bottom line.  The risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower offer isn't worth the potential gains. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my desired outcome."
