"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the deal's value to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going for a drastic opening offer, as that might cause Bob to immediately reject. 
* **Setting a baseline:**  This initial offer establishes a price point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a significant price difference, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested in the product, so there's still potential to reach a compromise.
* **Time to counter:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate that even at $900,000, Bob is getting a good deal.
* **Emphasizing finding common ground:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,200,000 I can get from John.
* **Further negotiation:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating there's still potential to reach a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have several rounds left, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. How about $875,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both move forward. "", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm taking his counteroffer seriously but still holding firm on my own price. 
* **Focusing on compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Time pressure:** The negotiation is getting closer to the middle ground, and I want to close the deal as soon as possible, as my minimum acceptable price is still a good bit higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $825,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,200,000 I can get from John.
* **More negotiation rounds:** We have several more rounds to go, and there's a chance that Bob might be willing to go higher.
* **John's offer is safe:**  The deal with John is guaranteed, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit low for me.  To show you my willingness to make a deal, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm taking Bob's offer seriously but not giving up on a better price.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise, demonstrating that I'm open to finding common ground.
* **Pressure to close:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I need to start getting closer to a final deal.  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it also sets a firm price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $820,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're at the 8th round, and only two rounds remain. There's a high risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.
* **Limited potential:** Bob's final offer of $820,000 is only $20,000 higher than his previous offer.  This suggests that there's little room for further negotiation, and we may not be able to get close to my desired price.
* **John's offer is much better:**  I can immediately sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is a significantly better deal than what Bob is offering.
* **No risk:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to budge further."
