"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a solid deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,175,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
