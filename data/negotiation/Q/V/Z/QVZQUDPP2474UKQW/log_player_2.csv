Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a solid deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.
