"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500, which is a great deal considering its worth. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. However, please note that I have another buyer, John, who's willing to purchase it for $12,000, so I need a decision fairly quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
