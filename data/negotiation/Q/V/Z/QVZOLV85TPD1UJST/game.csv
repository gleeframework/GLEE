"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,750 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,875. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
