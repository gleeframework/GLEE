{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting us closer to our desired profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the security of John as a backup buyer, ensuring we can sell the product for our minimum price if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a profitable price and ensuring we don't lose the opportunity to sell to John if necessary."
