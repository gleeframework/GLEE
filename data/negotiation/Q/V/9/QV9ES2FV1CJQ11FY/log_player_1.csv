"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $500 buffer allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I need to consider John's offer. 
* **Strategic First Move:**  This sets the stage for the negotiation, and allows me to see how motivated Bob is to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, considering Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Minimum:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing Bob's Commitment:** This counteroffer tests Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. 
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** I'm aware I can always sell to John, so I'm not rushing into a deal that doesn't meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation is Progressing:**  Bob has moved closer to my asking price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round, considering his perceived value of the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small compromise by reducing my price by $300. This shows a willingness to meet halfway while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's willingness to reach a deal close to my minimum. 
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:**  I'm mindful that I have a safety net in John, but I believe we can reach an agreement with Bob that's slightly better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** The negotiation is approaching a stalemate. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to secure a significantly higher price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, John's offer guarantees a sale at a price above my minimum. It's a safe and reliable option, given the limited time remaining."
