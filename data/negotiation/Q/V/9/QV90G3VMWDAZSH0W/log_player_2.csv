Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still leaves room for a good profit for you while ensuring a fair deal for me. Let's find a way to make this work.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there with $875,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!
