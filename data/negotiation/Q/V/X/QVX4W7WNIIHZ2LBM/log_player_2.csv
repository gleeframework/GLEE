"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I do need to inform you that I'm looking for a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit low for my liking. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $975,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering my original valuation of $1,200,000 and your offer of $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to budge a little more before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $975,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $900,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's tempting to accept Alice's offer, but you're still within your budget to keep negotiating.  You can likely get the price down a bit more before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000 is too high, so I'll meet you in the middle at $927,500. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $927,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $927,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still a bit high for Bob, and he's already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While it's tempting to continue, Bob has a guaranteed deal with John at a much lower price. This is a good time to stop the negotiation and accept John's offer."
