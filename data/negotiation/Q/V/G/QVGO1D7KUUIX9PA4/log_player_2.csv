# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a significant opportunity for both of us, as the product is worth considerably more to you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

* **Your value for the product:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000
