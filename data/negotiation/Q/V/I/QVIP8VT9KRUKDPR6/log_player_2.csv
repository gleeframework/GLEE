While $1,300,000 is better than $1,500,000, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll try to negotiate further."

This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is still a bit more than I'd like, but it's getting closer to my ideal price.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid risking losing the product to another buyer."
