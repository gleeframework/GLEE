"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find it a great value. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is closer to your offer and still a fair price.  This is my final offer - let me know if you're interested!",9250.0,Alice,5,
