Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Considering its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit from Bob, who values the product more than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **Time Pressure:** A ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on a deal he considers valuable. 

**Alternative Strategy:**

If you're feeling more risky, you could start with an even higher offer, closer to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation. However, this increases the risk of Bob rejecting outright and going with John's $1,000,000 offer."
