"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,150,000. This is a good price for Bob, as it is significantly lower than John's asking price of $1,500,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice might walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without unnecessary risk."
