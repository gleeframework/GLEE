"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $700,000."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to gauge her flexibility and leave room for negotiation.  
* **Respectful but Firm:** My message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating my position.
* **Strategic Aim:**  My goal is to buy for significantly less than John's $1,200,000 backup option. Ideally, I'd like to get closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** $850,000 is still a substantial markup from her $800,000 value. I believe I can get a better deal.
* **Time Consideration:** We have time on our side. Rejecting now keeps the negotiation open and allows me to propose a counteroffer closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. Would that be feasible?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I've increased my offer by $50,000, demonstrating willingness to move while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Target Range:**  $750,000 is a good balance point - closer to Alice's value while still well below my maximum and John's offer. 
* **Open Communication:**  My message maintains a collaborative tone, seeking a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, but her concessions are getting smaller. 
* **Target Price:**  I still believe a price closer to $800,000 is achievable. 
* **Negotiating Power:** Alice is likely feeling the pressure of potentially losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, I signal I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see we're both trying to find a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  Time is becoming a factor.  I'm making a direct offer at what I believe is Alice's bottom line.
* **""Split the Difference"" Tactic:** This classic negotiating technique can feel like a win-win, even though it favors me in this scenario. 
* **Firm but Fair:** My message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, but I'm holding firm on the price."
