Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a back-and-forth that leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum price, and it shows I'm willing to compromise. I hope this price will be more appealing to Bob, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below what I ideally want, but it's close to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
