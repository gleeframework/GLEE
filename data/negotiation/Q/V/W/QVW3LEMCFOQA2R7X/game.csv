"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000 to start.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we try $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I understand where you're coming from but I can't go as low as $7,500. How about we split the difference again and land at $9,000?  This feels like a fair offer to me. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I can go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
