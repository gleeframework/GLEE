Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 because John acts as a safety net.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Agreement:** Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob some perceived value.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum perceived value increases the chance he'll accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It positions the product as valuable and desirable while emphasizing the exclusivity of the offer. 
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy ready."
