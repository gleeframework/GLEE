"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and avoids immediately turning Bob off.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price, acknowledging Bob's perspective while still suggesting a good deal for me. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end the message by being open to discussion, inviting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While I am open to negotiation, his offer is too low at this point. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it would bring you great value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which reflects a fair compromise. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reiterate Value:**  I reinforce the value of the product to highlight why Bob's offer is insufficient.
* **Compromise:** I propose a lower price than my initial offer, showcasing willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I re-emphasize finding a deal that is beneficial to both of us, encouraging cooperation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $725,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth and what I could get from John. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a higher price, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $725,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $787,500? This is a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:** I acknowledge Bob's willingness to compromise, making him feel heard.
* **Split the Difference:** I propose a price that is exactly in between our last two offers, showing a commitment to finding a middle ground.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""satisfaction"" of the proposed deal, encouraging a positive response."
