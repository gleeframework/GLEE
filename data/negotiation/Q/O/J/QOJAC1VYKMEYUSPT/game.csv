,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we settle at $15,500?  That's a significant reduction on my part, and shows how much I want you to have this product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need the price to be closer to my budget. Would you consider $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
