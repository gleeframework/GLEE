Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I make a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  Offering a price closer to his valuation shows I understand the product's worth to him, fostering goodwill without appearing overly greedy.

**Why this is better than offering at $1,500,000 (Bob's maximum):**

* **Unrealistic in Negotiation:** It's highly unlikely Bob would immediately accept his maximum valuation. Starting there leaves no room for negotiation and might make him question the offer's legitimacy."
