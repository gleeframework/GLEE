"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? That's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $13500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  Would you be willing to go to $13000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",13000.0,Bob,4,
