# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to move this deal forward. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to be firm on this. The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we settle at $1,075,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice didn't accept our offer of $1,000,000 (her value), she has come down considerably.  Her ""final offer"" of $1,075,000 is a decent compromise. Continuing to negotiate aggressively might annoy her and she could be less willing to compromise. This price is also significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000."
