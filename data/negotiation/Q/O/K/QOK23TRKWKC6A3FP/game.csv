"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  This price is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to my desired value.  Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
