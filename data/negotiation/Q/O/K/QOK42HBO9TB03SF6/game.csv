"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to sell for, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's the best I can do.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $90, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to pay that, I'll consider it a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
