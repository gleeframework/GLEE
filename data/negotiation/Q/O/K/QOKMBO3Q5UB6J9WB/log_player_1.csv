``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $100 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, $110 is still below my minimum price.  I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $115. This is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a little more, $112 is pretty close to my minimum price, and we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
