"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to purchase it from you directly. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
