Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $130 to start the negotiations."", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement, but that price is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we agree on $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, it's unlikely he will reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $75 is a loss compared to the guaranteed $100. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed sale."
