"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
