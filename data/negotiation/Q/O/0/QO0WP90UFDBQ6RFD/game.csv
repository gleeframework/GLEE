"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $180 is a very fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a little to meet you halfway. How about $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose $130. I think that's a fair price for the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $130 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to make one final offer at $145.  This is the best I can do.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $135. That's my final offer.",135.0,Bob,6,
