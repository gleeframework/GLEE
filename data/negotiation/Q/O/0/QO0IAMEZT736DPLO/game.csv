"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $800,000, so I'd like to counteroffer at $825,000. This is my final compromise on the price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
