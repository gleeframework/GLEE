Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive in the negotiation.  He offers $9,000, still within his budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price. This sets a firm lower bound and encourages Alice to compromise."

```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to get closer to his desired $10,000 price point. There's still room for negotiation, and he has the option of buying from John as a fallback."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer hasn't changed from the previous round, and Bob should try to negotiate a lower price.  While the option to buy from John is always available, Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal from Alice. There's still room to bargain, and he has several rounds left."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering his maximum price, demonstrating a willingness to close the deal.  Since he has the option to purchase from John for the same price, this is a strong final offer to Alice. If she accepts, he gets the product for his desired price. If she rejects, he can move on to John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is only $50 lower than Bob's maximum price and John's offer. This means the negotiation is no longer worth the effort for Bob.  He can save time and effort by buying the product from John for $10,000, achieving his goal of getting the product for a price within his budget."
