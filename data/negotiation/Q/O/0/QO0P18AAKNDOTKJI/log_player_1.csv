{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will find it appealing and be willing to negotiate further.  If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth my time to keep negotiating or if I should just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get as close to my $120 goal as possible, Bob's offer is too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm coming down a little, but I'm still holding out for a decent price. I'm hoping that Bob will realize this product is worth more than $100 and will be willing to meet me in the middle.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is still slightly above my preferred budget, I would like to propose $105 as a compromise. This would allow us to reach an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is not my ideal price, it's a decent compromise.  I'm making a profit and avoiding the risk of Bob completely rejecting my offer and forcing me to sell to John at $100. It's a good deal for both of us."
