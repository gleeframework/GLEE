"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $975,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? That's still a significant saving for you, and it gives me the value I need.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  $995,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to get a reasonable return. It's up to you, but if you're not willing to meet me here, I might have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,,
