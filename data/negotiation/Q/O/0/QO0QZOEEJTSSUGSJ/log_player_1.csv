Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value of $120, but not so high that it's likely to be rejected immediately. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. While I could accept it and get some money, it's not worth it to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $120. This is my minimum value for the product, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to come up a bit from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not worth selling for. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer $110. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
