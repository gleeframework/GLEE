"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($110 vs $120 max)**.  You have room to negotiate.
* **You want to save as much money as possible**. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $95 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's value to her. This shows you're serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Be polite and encouraging:**  The message emphasizes your interest and a desire to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Set the stage for further negotiation:**  By suggesting a price, you open the door for Alice to either accept or counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price range:**  $102.5 is higher than your maximum $120.
* **You have room to negotiate further:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you have already shown you're serious about buying, so there's potential for a better price.
* **Rejection allows for a more advantageous counteroffer:** By rejecting the offer, you can make a new counteroffer that's closer to your desired price, potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $102.5 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $98.50. That's a fair compromise that's closer to where we both need to be."", ""product_price"": 98.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to your goal:**  $98.50 is a smaller step down from Alice's previous offer, showing you're getting closer to a deal. 
* **Highlighting compromise:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" to show you're trying to meet in the middle. 
* **Remaining polite:**  A polite and positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable."
