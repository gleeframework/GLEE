"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However, $12,000 is still quite a stretch for me. I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be a workable figure. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
