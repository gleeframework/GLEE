"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even higher than her own valuation. You should definitely reject this offer and try to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation. It's also important to appear interested in the product while making it clear that the initial price is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down significantly, $12,000 is still too high. You can try countering closer to your budget, but be ready to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't budge enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However, $12,000 is still quite a stretch for me. I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be a workable figure. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while inching closer to your maximum budget. It also leaves room for one more counter-offer from Alice if she's willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,500. While you could try to negotiate a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away. Buying from John for $8,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoid potentially drawn-out negotiations."
