,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However,  $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9000 for the product. How about we discuss at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8750?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $9250? It's a small increase, but it's still a good compromise.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9250 is still above my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle at $8875. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $9200 for the product. How about we try $9200?",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9200 is still too high for me. Let's try $9000.  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us much closer to an agreement. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $9200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $9200 for the product. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement at this price. Let's try $9250 one last time.",9250.0,Alice,9,
