Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the message sounds firm, offering $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager, potentially pushing the price a little higher.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
