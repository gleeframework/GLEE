"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its potential value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
