"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage engagement and gather information about his interest. 
 
This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's initial reaction and potentially start a negotiation that benefits me."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I have 8 rounds left to close the deal.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a little to $13,500. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows I'm serious about the deal but still value the product.

* **Closing Question:** I'm asking for Bob's response to push for a decision and see if we can close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can get a higher price.  I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can reach a more agreeable outcome. Since I still have several rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for this offer yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Fairness & Value:** I reiterate the value of the product while framing the offer as a fair compromise. 
* **Closing Question:** I'm again asking for Bob's feedback to push for a decision.

This approach aims to encourage Bob to accept my offer while still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I would like to propose a final price of $12750 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to earn more, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price.  I have 4 rounds remaining, but I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.  I'm also aware that I could sell to John for $10,000, which is significantly lower. 

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that is more profitable than selling to John."
