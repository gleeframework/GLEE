Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has come down, it's still well above your budget.  You've already stated your maximum, and  John is offering the product for your maximum price.  It's time to buy from John."
