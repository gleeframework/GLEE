"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I could do $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $12,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  To be honest, $13,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  I can do $12,800, and that's really pushing my budget. What do you say?",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,200 is my final offer.  This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. Let's close this deal!",13200.0,Alice,7,
