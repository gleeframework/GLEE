"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob ($10,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the value of the product to Bob, creating a sense of opportunity.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I could do $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Although Bob's offer is low, it's a clear indication that he's interested in the product. There's potential to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Time to Counter:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm  countering with a price that's closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for further negotiation.

* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the potential benefits of the deal.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $12,500? I think that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Time to Counter:** Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  To be honest, $13,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  I can do $12,800, and that's really pushing my budget. What do you say?
