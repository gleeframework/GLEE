Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed that his absolute maximum price is $800,000.  Continuing negotiations with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. It's time to cut your losses and accept the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, ensuring you get the product's minimum value to you."
