"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it could be incredibly beneficial to you.  While my asking price is $1,600,000,  I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us. What are your initial thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I can offer you $500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value.  To be completely transparent, $500,000  falls significantly short of what I consider a fair deal.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has significant value to you, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I hope this shows you I'm serious about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this price point works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're making progress. To be completely open with you, my absolute top limit for this product is $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $750,000  as a sign of good faith and to try and close this deal. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
