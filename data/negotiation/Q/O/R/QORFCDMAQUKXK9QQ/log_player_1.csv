"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and uses positive language to encourage a deal.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, I invite him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product.  I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to try and secure a higher profit, especially since I have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle at $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate to foster goodwill.
* **Split the Difference:** By offering a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, I signal a desire to find a fair compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's high value to encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Direct Proposal:** I phrase this counteroffer as a question (""how about..."") to encourage a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,375,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively could lead to Bob walking away, especially as we're getting closer to my baseline. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns rather than risking a prolonged negotiation process. 
 
While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, accepting this offer represents a strong balance of risk and reward."
