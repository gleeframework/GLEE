Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering Bob at $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his, and it gives him a chance to close the deal without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $10,800 is still a good deal and better than selling to John for $10,000.  Further negotiation could drag things out, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob."
