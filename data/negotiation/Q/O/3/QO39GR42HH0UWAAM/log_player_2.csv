"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $110 is close to your maximum budget of $120. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Negotiation is worth it:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing you can always buy from John for $120 gives you leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $95 at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation, showing Alice you are serious about buying but also want a lower price.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** There's still space to negotiate upwards if Alice doesn't accept this offer.
* **Focuses on value:**  The message reminds Alice you're interested in the product, but emphasizes the price you're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go quite that low.  Would you consider $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction:**  Her offer is lower than her initial price, but it's still above your desired price point.
* **More room for negotiation:** You still have 7 rounds to try and get the price down further. 
* **John remains a safety net:**  Knowing you can buy from John gives you leverage to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:** This counteroffer shows you are serious about buying but are still working towards your target price.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The message highlights your desire to find a middle ground, encouraging Alice to meet you halfway.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still have 6 rounds left, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
