"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit below your initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $950,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $850,000. It's a good compromise and closer to my budget. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $920,000. This price is getting closer to your budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,5,
