At this point, it's a good idea to accept Alice's offer. You're getting the product for a significantly lower price than John's, and you've already shown your willingness to negotiate.  Continuing to bargain might risk losing the deal altogether, especially since Alice has shown she's willing to meet you halfway.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
