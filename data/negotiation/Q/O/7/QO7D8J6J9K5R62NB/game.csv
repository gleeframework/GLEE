"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that considers its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low.  Considering the value of the product for you,  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit. Let's try to work something out.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $720,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $720,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $780,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's finalize this, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",780000.0,Alice,5,
