Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference -  $1,250,000. This would be a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 price."
