"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still provide a great deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is tempting, it's a bit too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $825,000?  This would still offer you a great value, and it would allow me to achieve a more comfortable profit margin.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position and I respect your need for a reasonable profit. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to move beyond $780,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $780,000 is still a little below where I need to be.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $790,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal.  What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and understanding. I'm willing to consider $795,000 as a compromise. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while providing you with a fair return for your product.",795000.0,Bob,6,
