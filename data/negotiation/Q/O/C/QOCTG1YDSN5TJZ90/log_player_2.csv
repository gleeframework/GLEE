"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's a good chance she'll accept a counteroffer closer to that value.  It's worth exploring the possibility of getting an even better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still significantly lower than my maximum budget, but closer to Alice's likely minimum. This is a good starting point to see if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my initial offer, but it's still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. It's important to remember that I have a limited number of rounds, but I'm also not desperate to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. This offer is a midpoint between my previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer, showing good faith and hopefully leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but more importantly, I'm running out of time.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of a deal falling through and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation.  Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product at a reasonable price."
