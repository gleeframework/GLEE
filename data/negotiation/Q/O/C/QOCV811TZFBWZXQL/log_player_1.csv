"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $10,000 is still too low for me."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $10,500 is a decent price and better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's also getting close to my minimum of $8,000."
