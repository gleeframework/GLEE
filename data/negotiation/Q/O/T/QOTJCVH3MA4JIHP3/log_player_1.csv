Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than $80 from Bob. It's worth at least that to me, so I'm not going to accept his offer just yet. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm looking to get closer to $90 for this product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. How about we split the difference and I come down to $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $95. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $95, Bob is clearly willing to pay a significant amount for the product. $92.50 is a good price, and I don't want to risk him backing out completely."
