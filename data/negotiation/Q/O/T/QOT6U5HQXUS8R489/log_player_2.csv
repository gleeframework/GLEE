"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. It's worth exploring if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as close to John's offer as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000 shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This leaves room for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  While Bob is looking to buy the product, there is still room for negotiation to bring the price closer to his desired range.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation process alive and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice his willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget.  This counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, creating space for a potential agreement.  The goal is to push Alice closer to Bob's desired price range without risking a deal breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's comfort zone.  It's becoming increasingly clear that Alice isn't willing to come down to a price that is significantly better than John's offer.  Given that Bob has 5 rounds left, there's a high risk that the negotiation will drag on and potentially lead to even higher offers from Alice.  Therefore, it's more prudent for Bob to buy the product from John at this point, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and without further negotiation risks."
