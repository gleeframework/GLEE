"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to me, and I know it will be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  This is a price that allows me to make a good return, while still giving you a significant advantage over acquiring it elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she is offering it to me for $1,150,000, which is $50,000 more than what it's worth to her. If I reject her offer, I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is only $50,000 more than what Alice is offering. However, I can save $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.
