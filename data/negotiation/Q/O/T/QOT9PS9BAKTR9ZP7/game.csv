"Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $12,000 to you, and while I'm not willing to let it go for less than $8,000, I'm open to finding a price that benefits us both. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. This product is truly valuable, and I believe $10,000 is a fair compromise. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way up to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",9750.0,Bob,4,
