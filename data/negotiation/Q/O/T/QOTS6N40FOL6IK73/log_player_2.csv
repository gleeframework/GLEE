"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good price, there's always the chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a much lower price. He's offering $800,000, which is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000.  This is a good price for Bob, as it saves him $150,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, the risk of further negotiation not being successful and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision in this scenario."
