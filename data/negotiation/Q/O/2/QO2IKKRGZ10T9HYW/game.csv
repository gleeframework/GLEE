"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be useful, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $9,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $15,000 is fair. It reflects the true worth of what you're getting. ",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $10,500.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and reflects my seriousness about purchasing. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
