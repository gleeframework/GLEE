Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Higher than John's offer:**  By offering $1,500,000, you're demonstrating that the product is valuable to you and you're not desperate to sell it for John's price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $1,500,000 leaves room for you to negotiate down if Bob expresses interest but can't meet that price.
* **Unknown value to Bob:**  Without knowing Bob's perceived value, a higher offer creates the possibility of a higher sale, while still having a fallback option with John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's financial situation:**  If you have any information about Bob's financial standing, you may adjust the price accordingly.
* **Market research:**  If possible, try to gather information about the market value of the product. This can help you determine a more realistic asking price.
* **Negotiation skills:**  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he makes a counteroffer."
