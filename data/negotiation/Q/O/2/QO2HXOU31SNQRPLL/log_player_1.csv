Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, Alice should aim to get at least that much from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's minimum is $10,000, starting at that price might discourage Bob. Offering a slightly higher price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested but wants to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest without revealing Alice's absolute bottom line. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might decline even this offer. However, it's the best strategy to maximize potential profit while still having John as a backup buyer."
