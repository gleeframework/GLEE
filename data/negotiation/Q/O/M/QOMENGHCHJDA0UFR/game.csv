"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  To make this work, I can go down to $115. This is my final offer, as it's very close to my minimum. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise I'll have to go with another offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115, which would be $112.50. Can you accept that?",112.5,Bob,6,
