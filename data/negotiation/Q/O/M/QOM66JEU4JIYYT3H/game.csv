"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your latest offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I propose we aim for $950,000 as a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer,  I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've reviewed your proposal. While I respect your position, I believe we can find common ground at $975,000. This offers a good balance between our interests.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but  $975,000 is still below my minimum.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
