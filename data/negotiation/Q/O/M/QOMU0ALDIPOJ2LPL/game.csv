"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $16,000 is still a little steep for me though.  Could you do $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  $15,500 is getting close, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to walk if you can't do $14,500.",14500.0,Bob,6,
