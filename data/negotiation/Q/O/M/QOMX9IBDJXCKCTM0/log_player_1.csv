Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I know it's the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but I'm hoping he'll accept it.  If not, I'll be ready to negotiate, but I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to risk losing this sale and going to the next round of negotiation, hoping that Bob will eventually come closer to my price. I'm confident that I can get at least something closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a price of $115. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer of $120.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'll be ready to continue negotiating in the next round."
