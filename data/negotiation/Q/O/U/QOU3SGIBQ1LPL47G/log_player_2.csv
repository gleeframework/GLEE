"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $180 is way over your budget of $100. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I can do $160, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $160 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I'm going to have to stick to my offer of $120. Let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $120, hoping Alice will realize that I'm serious about getting the product and that she needs to compromise to make a deal. I'm emphasizing that I'm serious about buying the product, but I need a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $140, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $140 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a lower price. I'm not yet at the point where I'd consider buying from John because there's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $130.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate and that I'm getting closer to her asking price. By offering $130, I'm also creating a situation where Alice is more likely to accept my offer to avoid losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I can do $145, but I'm starting to think that's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still too high for my budget, and we've reached a point where I'm not sure further negotiation will get me to my target price.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $100, which is well within my budget, it's the best decision at this point."
