"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal than $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, hopefully encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $100 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm hoping we can reach a middle ground. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $95 is my final offer. I really want to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  This is my last offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $90, and that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we've already been through several rounds of negotiation. While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to risk dropping below my minimum. It's better to sell to John at $120, ensuring I get at least my minimum desired value for the product."
