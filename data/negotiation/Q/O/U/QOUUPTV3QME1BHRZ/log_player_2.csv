# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000.

Alice is still higher than my ideal price, but we're getting closer. I'll counter again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $800,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $815000.

Alice is coming down in price, and we're close to my target. It's better to accept and save $385,000 compared to John's price, even if I could potentially get a few thousand dollars lower."
