# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
