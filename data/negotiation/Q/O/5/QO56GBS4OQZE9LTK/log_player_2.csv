"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000. I need to negotiate to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've made a counteroffer at $10,000.  This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget.  I'm aiming to find a compromise, but I'm also setting a clear boundary.  This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and how much she values the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, $16,000 is still way over my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $16,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident this product has value, but I can't justify that price.  Let's try $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by offering a price that's closer to my budget. This price is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay from John, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution with Alice. It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
