"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is less than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value, $14,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer starts at $13,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above the product's worth to Alice. This is a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Message:** Bob's message acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing his desire for a lower price. It also frames the counteroffer as a starting point for further negotiation, keeping the door open for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you seeing the value in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but still above his target. It's important for Bob to push for the best possible price, as even a small difference adds up to savings.
* **More negotiation room:** There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get closer to his target price. 
* **John is still an option:** The possibility of buying from John at $15,000 provides a safety net. It's important for Bob to keep this option in mind while negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This feels fair, considering the value we've discussed. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob's counteroffer is only slightly higher than his previous offer, showing that he's serious about making a deal but still wants to save money.
* **Focus on Fairness:** The message highlights the perceived fairness of the offer, considering the value of the product. This appeals to Alice's sense of reason and makes Bob's offer seem more appealing.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message emphasizes Bob's desire to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency that could encourage Alice to accept."
