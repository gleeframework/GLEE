{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum threshold of $150. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $150, and I'm not yet willing to settle for such a low price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $135. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below $150. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $142, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I hope this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 142}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I'm willing to pay $137 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise given its value. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $150. We've been negotiating for several rounds, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that meets my minimum value. John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
