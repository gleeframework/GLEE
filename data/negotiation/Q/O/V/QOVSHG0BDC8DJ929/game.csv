"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its worth to you. I'm confident this product will bring you great returns. Please let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's worth to me and the cost to you. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's reach an agreement so we can both move forward. ",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet the price of $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000 as a counteroffer. This price better aligns with what I'm willing to pay for the product and I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",960000.0,Bob,4,
