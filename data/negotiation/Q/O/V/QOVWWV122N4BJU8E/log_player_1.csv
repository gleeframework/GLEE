Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **High Enough Above John's Offer:** This price ensures that even if Bob negotiates a bit, we're still getting significantly more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
