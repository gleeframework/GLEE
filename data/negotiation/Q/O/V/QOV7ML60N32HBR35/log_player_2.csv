"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $120. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a chance you can get it for less. Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price.  You'll still have the option to buy from John for $150 if needed."
