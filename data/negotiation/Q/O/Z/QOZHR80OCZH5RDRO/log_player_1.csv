Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is far too low for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$95 is still below my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's a small decrease from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. This shows that I'm open to compromise while staying firm on my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I've already made several counteroffers. I'm not confident that we'll reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. It's time to sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
