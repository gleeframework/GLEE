"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $180. It's a great compromise that still reflects its value to me.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $150 is a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I can offer you the product for $170. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",170.0,Alice,5,
