Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'd be willing to go up to $118, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $118 is a good deal at this point.  It's significantly more than my minimum and Bob seems firm on his final offer. Holding out longer risks losing him entirely."
