"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. Would you be willing to come down just a bit more, say to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to a price point, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer $10,700. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing too much profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10700.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle this right now at $10,600? This is a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",10600.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,650. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10650.0,Alice,7,
