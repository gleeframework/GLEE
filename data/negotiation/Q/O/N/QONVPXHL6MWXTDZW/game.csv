"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my best offer and reflects the value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a ways off from what I can do. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $700,000. If you can meet me somewhere around there, I think we could make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
