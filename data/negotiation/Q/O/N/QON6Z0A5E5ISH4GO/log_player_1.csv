{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150 to make this deal happen. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. $150 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $135? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

While $135 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with it. Selling to John for $150 guarantees I meet my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation."
