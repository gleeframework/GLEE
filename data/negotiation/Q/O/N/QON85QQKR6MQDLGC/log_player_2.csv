"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a substantial savings for you while still ensuring a fair return for me. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Buying from Alice saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Even though Alice's offer is above her own valuation, it's still a good deal for Bob.**  He gets the product for less than his maximum valuation."
