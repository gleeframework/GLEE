Round 2
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,200,000 falls significantly short of that.  I could consider coming down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its true worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While I value your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 still undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no higher. I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems stuck on $1,300,000.  It's time to apply pressure and highlight the alternative option of selling to John. This might push Bob to be more flexible."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but I have another interested buyer who sees the true value of this product. I'm prepared to close a deal with them at my minimum price. To be fair, I'll offer you one last chance to secure this for yourself at $1,375,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,300,000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While ideally, we'd want more, Bob is firm on his price and is willing to walk away. Accepting his offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit, and it's better than risking the deal falling through and potentially getting stuck with John's lower offer in the later rounds."
