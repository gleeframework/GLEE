"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not offering the absolute maximum I'd accept, which allows for a more dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:** $115 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation space:**  While Bob's offer is lower, there's still space to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer if I counter. 
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit but doesn't maximize my earnings potential."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $125?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm being  flexible but not overly eager to accept Bob's first offer. 
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting that my counteroffer is still a ""good deal"" for both of us,  which can help Bob feel more comfortable moving closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $122? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  Bob's offer of $122 is above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so it guarantees a profit for me.
* **Limited rounds:**  We are only in round 4, and I want to avoid losing any more potential negotiation time.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to get a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with only the $120 offer from John. Accepting this offer ensures a good outcome."
