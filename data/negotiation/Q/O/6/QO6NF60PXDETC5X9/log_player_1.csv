"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm sure it would be of great benefit to you. My initial asking price is $1,500,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Rationale:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a high price allows for negotiation room. I believe this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so this is a reasonable starting point. 
* **Open and Friendly:** The message is polite and friendly, aiming to build a rapport with Bob and encourage a positive negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product's potential benefit to Bob without revealing specific details, which keeps him engaged and wanting to learn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $1000000. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

While Bob's offer is close to my floor price, I believe there's room for further negotiation.  Selling to John would be a secure option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is a good starting point, I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and leaves some room for us both to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Maintain Optimism:**  The message is still positive, acknowledging Bob's offer while staying firm on the product's value.
* **Compromise:** I'm dropping my price from the initial $1,500,000, showing flexibility.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" to justify the price point and encourage Bob to consider it further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I hope this offer is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  However, I'm still holding out for more. I believe there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Show Progress:** I'm acknowledging that Bob is moving closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  While I'm dropping my price, I'm still not at his price point. This keeps the negotiation active.
* **Fair Offer:** I'm framing the new price as a ""fair"" compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting that we should reach an agreement soon, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am willing to pay $1125000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering both the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my desired price point.  I've already made several concessions and the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate.  Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my profit while also securing a sale within a reasonable timeframe."
