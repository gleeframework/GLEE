"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $13,500. This is my best offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  My final offer is $12,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be careful. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the sale.",13000.0,Alice,7,
