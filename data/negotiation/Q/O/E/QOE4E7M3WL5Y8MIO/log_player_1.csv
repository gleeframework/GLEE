"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which still leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still protecting my bottom line. I'm also reinforcing the benefits of the deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11500 is a bit too high. How about $10500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for less than I feel the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  Let's split the difference this time. How about $11,000? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that splitting the difference will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11000. How about $10750? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge much further. I've already been through several rounds and am unlikely to get closer to my desired price. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John.  I'm happy with $12,000, and I don't want to risk wasting more time with Bob."
