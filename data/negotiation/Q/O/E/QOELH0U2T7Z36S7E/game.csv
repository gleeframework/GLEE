"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $12,000 is still above my limit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this.  Would that work for you?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to get a certain price, but $11,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
