"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $125?  That gives us both a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $112.50 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that amount?",112.5,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $115, which is $111.50. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",111.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! How about we agree on $113?  That's a fair price, and it means we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",113.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my limit, Alice. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",108.0,Bob,10,
