"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, the value of this product is significant and $950,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to move down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
