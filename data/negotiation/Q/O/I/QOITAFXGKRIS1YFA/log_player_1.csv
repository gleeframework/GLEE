Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $135. It's a great deal on a product I know you'll love."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $15 markup (12.5%) is reasonable and unlikely to deter Bob if he truly values the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup ensures I'm not desperate and can confidently negotiate with Bob."
