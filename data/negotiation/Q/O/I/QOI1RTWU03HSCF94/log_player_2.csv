Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is a good price, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know if this is acceptable.
