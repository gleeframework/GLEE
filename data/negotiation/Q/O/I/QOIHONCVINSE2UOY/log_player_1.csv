"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident it's a fair price given its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we start closer to my limit?  I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $800,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me.  To be frank, I need to stay closer to $1,000,000.  Would you consider $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $925,000 is still below my floor. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping we can close the gap further.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing negotiation and the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still a bit off. How about $1,025,000? That's a strong offer considering I could go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,050,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. We've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would be more profitable, but there's a higher chance of securing the deal with Bob at this point."
