Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum.  I'll try to get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still close to my target with John.  I'll see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good deal for both of us - you'll still be getting a great product at a fair price, and I'll be able to move this deal forward.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see some more flexibility from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  John is a guaranteed $1,000,000. I'm going to take the sure thing."
