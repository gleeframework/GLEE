"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity for you to gain significant value. I'm asking $1,200,000 for it, reflecting its high quality and potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good deal for both of us - you'll still be getting a great product at a fair price, and I'll be able to move this deal forward.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see some more flexibility from you.",980000.0,Bob,6,
