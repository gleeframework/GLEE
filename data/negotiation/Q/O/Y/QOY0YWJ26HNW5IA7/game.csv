"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the product's true value while also being a good price for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could make this work at $1,300,000.  Do you think we can find an agreement at that price point?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
