"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, making it attractive to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below my minimum value of $12,000, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
I'm offering $9,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear boundary. I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is still a bit below my desired price point, but it's getting closer.  I'm confident that I can make a decent profit at this price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
