Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept and sell the product for $80, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $80.  I believe this price is still fair while also being closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my desired price, but it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's also closer to my initial price than his previous offer, and I'm willing to accept it.  This is a better outcome than selling to John for $100."
