"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $120? ",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at that price?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $130?  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",135.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping to get the product for a little less. How about $132?  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $135, but I really think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $133, but that's as low as I can go.",133.0,Alice,7,
