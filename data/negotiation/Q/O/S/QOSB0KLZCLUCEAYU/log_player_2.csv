"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, but you can get it from John for that price. So, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $120 right away. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at 110? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $110 is still a good deal for you.  It's lower than John's price and you are saving $40 compared to your initial valuation of the product. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
