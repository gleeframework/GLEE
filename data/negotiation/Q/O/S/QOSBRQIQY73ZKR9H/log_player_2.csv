Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than her previous offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Buying from John guarantees Bob the best price, staying within his budget."
