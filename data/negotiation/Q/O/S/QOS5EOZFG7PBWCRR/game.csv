"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. It's a valuable asset that I'm sure will be a great addition to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still offers you a significant return on your investment, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This price allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,275,000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
