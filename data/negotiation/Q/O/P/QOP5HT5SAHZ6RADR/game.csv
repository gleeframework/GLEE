"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the significant value the product holds for you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can reach a final deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,050,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
