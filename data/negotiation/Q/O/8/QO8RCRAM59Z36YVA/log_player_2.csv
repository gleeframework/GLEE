"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. $90 is still above your ideal price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has come down from her original price of $90 and is now offering $87.50, which is within your budget of $100 and closer to your desired price point.  It's likely that further negotiation would only result in small price changes. It's better to accept and secure the product at a reasonable price."
