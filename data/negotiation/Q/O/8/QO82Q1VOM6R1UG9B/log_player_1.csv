"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,500. This reflects the unique features and value of my product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable paying $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the unique features of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have loved to get closer to $12,000, $10,500 is a good compromise and a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob.  It's also important to note that if I reject this offer, I risk losing the deal altogether. I'd rather secure a sale now than risk waiting and ending up with nothing."
