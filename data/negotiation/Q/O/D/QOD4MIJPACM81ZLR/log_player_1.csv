"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer,  I'm willing to hold out for a better price, as I know the product is worth more to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price - how about $8,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $8,250 is a good compromise and closer to my initial asking price. It's better than selling to John for $8,000 and leaves me some room for profit."
