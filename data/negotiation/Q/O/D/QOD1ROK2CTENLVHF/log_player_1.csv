Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $150, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum price ($80) but below his maximum.
* **Starting High:**  A starting price of $120 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
