"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $180. This is way above Bob's budget.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm really interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay that much."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $155 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
