Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $120 is already a competitive price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $92? I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear the negotiation is progressing slowly.  We have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John. It's not worth the risk of Bob's offer not reaching $100 or potentially wasting more time on further negotiation rounds."
