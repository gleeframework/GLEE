"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny of the $12,000 you estimate its worth. However, considering my costs and aiming to achieve a fair profit, I propose we discuss a price that is beneficial for both parties. Would you be open to discussing a price point that might be slightly below your valuation but still significantly higher than what others might offer? Let's aim for a compromise that respects the value you see in this product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation around your perceived value of $12,000. While her offer is below that, it's still significantly higher than John's offer and her own valuation of the product. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price and encourage her to come down closer to a price point favorable for you."
