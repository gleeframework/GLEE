Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to a counteroffer, but I'm also establishing my starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.
* I'll keep the $1,000,000 offer from John in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's not enough to justify selling the product at this time.
* **I still have the option to sell to John for a higher price, so there's no urgency to accept Bob's offer.**

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'll aim for a price closer to $900,000, but I will keep in mind Bob's ability and willingness to pay $850,000 as a benchmark."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm  counteroffering with a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise to make it seem more appealing to Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm using language that encourages further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Prepare for further negotiations:** If he rejects, I'll need to assess my options based on his next counteroffer.
* **Consider John's offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a backup option."
