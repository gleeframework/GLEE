(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer at my maximum budget. This establishes my firm price point and puts pressure on Alice to come down.  It's a significant reduction from her initial offer, but I'm willing to pay this if it means securing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I want to see if she's willing to come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility but also pushing her to meet me halfway.  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm optimistic that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a lower price and potentially close the deal for something closer to $1,500,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing I'm willing to compromise, but also signaling I'm getting closer to my upper limit.  This should incentivize Alice to accept, as she's already come down significantly. If she rejects, I'll be forced to consider John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $1,900,000.  This price is too high for me, and we are already in round 7, leaving little room for negotiation.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further rounds with Alice potentially resulting in a worse deal."
