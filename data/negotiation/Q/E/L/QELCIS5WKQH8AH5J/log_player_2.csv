Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $12500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.
