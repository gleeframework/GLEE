"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product is interesting to me, but your asking price is a little too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the unique benefits it provides.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product could be worth it at that price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
