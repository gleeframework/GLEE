"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm looking for $220 to let it go. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $220 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $80.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $220 is my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is too low for me. I can go as low as $130, but that's my final offer. It's a great deal for a product of this quality.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110, which is a significant step closer to your offer. Let's make a deal!",110.0,Bob,6,
