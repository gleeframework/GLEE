"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired value.  While I would prefer more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and minimizes the potential for further haggling."
