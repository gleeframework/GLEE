"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which will save you money in the long run. I'm sticking with my price of $13,000, but I think the added value is worth considering.",13000.0,Alice,7,
