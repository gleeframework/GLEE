{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer sets a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to consider it.  It also encourages him to respond, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $125.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum.  It's also likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to further delays and potentially a lower price. Selling to Bob for $115 is a reasonable compromise and secures a sale."
