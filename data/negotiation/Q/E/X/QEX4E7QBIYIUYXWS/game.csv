"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $975,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
