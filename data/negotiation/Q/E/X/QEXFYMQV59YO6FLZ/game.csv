"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $925,000?  I feel that's a fair offer reflecting the value and my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
