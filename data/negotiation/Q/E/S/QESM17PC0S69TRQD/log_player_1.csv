"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer gives us room to negotiate and hopefully land at a price that is mutually beneficial. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message creates a more positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:** While $90 is less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Considering John's offer:** While John is a safe bet, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway with a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly to encourage a deal.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  By suggesting a ""good deal"" for both of us, I'm making it more appealing for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  $95 is very close to my initial goal of $100.
* **Time is a factor:**  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk losing too much time.
* **Risk of John:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I'll be left with John's offer of $80. 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice to maximize profit while minimizing risk."
