"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1200000. While it's worth more to me, I believe this price is a fair reflection of its value to you. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
