"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is still below his maximum budget, but also leaves some room for negotiation. He's aiming for a price that's closer to his own value for the product while also being attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his target. Bob is determined to get the best possible deal and wants to see if he can push Alice lower.  He can still try to negotiate a better price and doesn't want to settle for a price that's significantly higher than what he could get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing his willingness to compromise.  He's aiming for a price that's still within his acceptable range but closer to Alice's asking price, increasing the chance of a deal.  If Alice rejects this, Bob might consider buying from John as he's running out of negotiation room."
