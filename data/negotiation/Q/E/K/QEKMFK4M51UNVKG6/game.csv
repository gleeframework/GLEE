"Alice, your starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but it's only worth $800,000 to me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $500,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $650,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $650,000 is still too low for me. This product is worth a lot, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $850,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
