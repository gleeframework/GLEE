"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $825,000? I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, while giving me a reasonable return. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your position and I think we can bridge the gap. How about $800,000? It's at the upper limit of what I'm comfortable spending, but I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
