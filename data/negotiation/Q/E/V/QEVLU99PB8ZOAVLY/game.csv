"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $140 is tempting, it's a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $155?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. $145 is really close, but I'd need to come down to $150 to make this work. It's a great price for such a valuable product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. I'm willing to pay $142 for the product. Can you consider that?",142.0,Bob,6,
