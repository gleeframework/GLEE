Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth $180, but I'm willing to let it go for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm still holding out hope that I can convince Bob to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $140 is tempting, it's a bit lower than what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $155?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $145 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to budge.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. $145 is really close, but I'd need to come down to $150 to make this work. It's a great price for such a valuable product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. I'm willing to pay $142 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While $150 is less than I was hoping for, it's still a fair price and it's better than taking $142 from Bob.  It's clear that Bob isn't willing to budge much more, and I don't want to risk getting into a long, drawn-out negotiation.  It's time to move on."
