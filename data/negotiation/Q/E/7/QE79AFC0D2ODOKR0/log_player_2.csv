"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good deal compared to John's $120 price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground between his maximum price ($120) and Alice's initial offer ($100). A counteroffer of $90 shows willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100 for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob wants to save as much as possible, and rejecting the offer opens the possibility of getting a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $95.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price that's slightly lower than Alice's counteroffer. By splitting the difference, Bob shows he's serious about closing the deal while also staying within his budget."
