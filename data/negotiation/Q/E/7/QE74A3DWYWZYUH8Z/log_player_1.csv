Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that the value to Bob is likely higher than $1,500,000, which is what I could get from John.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer since it's the same as what I could get from John, I'm going to  reject it and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, but it still reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal. It's $100,000 more than what I could get from John, and it shows that Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future who might be willing to pay closer to my initial asking price."
