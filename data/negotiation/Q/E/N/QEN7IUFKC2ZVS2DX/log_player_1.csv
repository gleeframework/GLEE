Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, he should be willing to pay more than my minimum price.  This offer is a starting point that should encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a better price than selling to John, it is still below my desired price point. I believe I can get a higher price from Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, but it also demonstrates that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is still a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000. It's important to recognize that continued negotiations may not yield a higher price, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes further negotiation risk."
