"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1200000. This price reflects the significant value it holds.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1200000 is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900000 at this time. This price reflects the value I see in the product and what I can afford.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is a good starting point, it doesn't fully capture the potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's work together to bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and what I can afford. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. This price reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your budgetary constraints. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $1000000 is a bit more than I can comfortably pay at this time. However, I'm willing to pay $975000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
