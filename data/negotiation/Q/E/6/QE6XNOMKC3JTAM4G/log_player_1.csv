Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I would like to counter your offer with $1,150,000. This price still allows me to stay within my financial limits while acknowledging the value of the product.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that we are unlikely to reach a price that significantly exceeds John's offer. It makes more sense to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
