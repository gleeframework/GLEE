"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be open to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to meet my minimum threshold. I can offer the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position on the minimum threshold, but that price is simply not feasible for me. To be frank, if we can't agree on $10,000, I might have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a tough pill to swallow, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the closest I can get to your target price without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be upfront with you.  My absolute limit is $10,500. If you can't agree to that, I'll have to go with John, even though I'd prefer to work with you.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one final push to try to meet you there. I can offer the product to you for $10,750. This is as close as I can get to your target price without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. If you can't agree, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",10500.0,Bob,10,
