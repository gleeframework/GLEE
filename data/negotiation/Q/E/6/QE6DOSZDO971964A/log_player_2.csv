""product_price"": 10500
}
```
This round, we're making a strong final push while being honest about our backup option. 
* **Clear ultimatum:** We're stating our absolute limit and implying that exceeding it means walking away. 
* **Alternative pressure:** Mentioning John's offer adds time pressure and emphasizes that we're willing to walk away.
* **Polite but firm:** Maintaining a respectful tone while being firm about our limitations keeps the negotiation from turning hostile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one final push to try to meet you there. I can offer the product to you for $10,750. This is as close as I can get to your target price without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've come a long way in the negotiation, but it's crucial to stand firm in this penultimate round. Alice has consistently tried to push the price up, and while $10,750 is tempting, we've set our limit. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about our constraints and are willing to walk away. 

**Strategic Implication:**

This rejection sets the stage for the final round. Alice knows our absolute limit and that we have an alternative option.  This pressure increases the likelihood of her either accepting our $10,500 offer in the final round or proposing a price very close to it."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. If you can't agree, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Final Round Strategy:**

* **Direct and firm:** We're reiterating our final offer, leaving no room for misinterpretation.
* **Time pressure:**  Explicitly stating that this is our last offer before going with John creates urgency.
* **Controlled tone:**  We maintain politeness and express understanding but remain resolute in our position.

This approach maximizes our chances of a favorable outcome in the final round.  Alice is now aware that this is her last opportunity to make a deal with us."
