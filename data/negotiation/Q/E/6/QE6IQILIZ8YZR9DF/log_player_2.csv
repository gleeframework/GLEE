"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really eager to close the deal, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,125?  I'm really close to my limit, but I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity. "", ""product_price"": 11125}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to get at least $11,200. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really close to my limit, but I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity.  How about $11,150?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

He has reached a point where he is unlikely to get Alice to go lower than $11,200.  It's better for him to buy the product from John for $15,000, which is his maximum limit, than continue to negotiate with Alice and risk losing the deal altogether."
