Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Reservation Price:** You don't know how much Bob values the product, so you have to aim within a range that is profitable for you but potentially appealing to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the chance to potentially secure a deal closer to your desired price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, securing a deal with Bob above your minimum allows you to potentially earn more. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making a compelling case to Bob."
