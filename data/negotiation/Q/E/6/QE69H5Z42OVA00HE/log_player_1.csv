"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,500 is too low, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price.  I'll see if I can negotiate something more favorable in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $7,500, so I'll offer $8,150. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,150 is a good price, and it's closer to my goal than selling to John for $8,000. I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
