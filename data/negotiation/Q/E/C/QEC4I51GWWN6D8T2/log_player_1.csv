Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $12,000 is significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:** By starting with a relatively high price, you signal that you believe in the value of your product.

If Bob rejects this offer, we'll analyze his counteroffer and decide how to proceed.  Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $8,000 at any point if you're not satisfied with Bob's negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, it's still significantly below the value we initially set for the product. There's room for further negotiation, and we're not in a desperate position to accept his counteroffer immediately.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, we can counter with a price closer to our desired range, potentially increasing our profits. We want to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, and a counteroffer gives us the opportunity to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your goal:**  $10,500 is closer to your ideal price point than $9,000, but still offers a discount from your original offer.
* **Justifies the price:** The message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Shows flexibility:**  By lowering your offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, we'll have to decide if we want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. I'd be willing to pay $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is just below our initial counteroffer of $10,500.  While it's not our ideal price, it's significantly better than John's offer of $8,000. 

Here's why we should accept:

* **Close to target:** $9,800 is within a reasonable range of our desired price.
* **Potential for future deals:** By securing this sale, we establish a relationship with Bob that could lead to future transactions.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether and having to settle for John's lower offer.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and keeps the negotiation moving forward, potentially opening doors for future opportunities."
