"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position. It signals to Bob that the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's genuinely interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'm confident that Bob values the product and I want to explore his willingness to pay further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It shows him that I'm willing to negotiate but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. We're getting closer, but I'm still hopeful we can reach a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $940,000.  This is a small decrease from my last offer, but I want to show Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. I'm still hoping to get as close to $950,000 as possible, but I want to avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $930,000.  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I risk losing him altogether. We're very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident that I can make up the difference through other means."
