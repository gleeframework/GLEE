Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price is still fair given the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer.  At this point, accepting her offer would mean overpaying compared to John's price."
