"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $18,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."

Alice's offer:

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower, especially since she's already made a concession."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $15,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's latest offer is $15,500, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since the negotiation seems to be reaching a stalemate, it's time for Bob to take the safe route and buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget."
