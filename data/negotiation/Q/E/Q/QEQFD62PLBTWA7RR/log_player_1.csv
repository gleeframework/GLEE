Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $14,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. How about $13,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm starting to feel a little pressure since I'm only 5 rounds away from having to sell to John, but I'm not willing to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling the pressure to sell quickly, but I'm still hoping to find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000 for this round.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping you'll meet me halfway.  We're getting very close to a deal, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision.  I've been working with Bob for a while and thought I could get him to meet me in the middle. However, we are only two rounds away from having to sell to John.  Selling to John will guarantee me my minimum price of $15,000, and I don't want to risk losing out on that.  I'll let Bob know that I need to move on and sell the product to someone else."
