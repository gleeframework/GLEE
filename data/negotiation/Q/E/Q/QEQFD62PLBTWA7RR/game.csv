"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $14,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm feeling the pressure to sell quickly, but I'm still hoping to find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000 for this round.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping you'll meet me halfway.  We're getting very close to a deal, let's make it happen.",14000.0,Alice,7,
