"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a good deal for you, but you can potentially save even more by negotiating.
* You have a fallback option to buy from John for $120, which gives you negotiating power. 
* By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $92. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $92 is still within your acceptable range ($120).
* You've already rejected her initial offer and countered, so further negotiation might not yield much better results.
* Buying from John for $120 is more expensive than accepting Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation, as it allows you to acquire the product for a price that is both reasonable and within your budget."
