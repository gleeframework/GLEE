"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm not at liberty to disclose all the details just yet, but I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident the product's true value could exceed this price.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
