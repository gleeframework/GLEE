"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're aiming to pay no more than $15,000, and Alice is already asking for $13,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for a significant price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to start with an offer of $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening counter:**  You're starting low to establish a strong negotiating position.
* **Focus on finding a fair price:** The message emphasizes your interest in the product while suggesting a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, leaving space for back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,500 is still above your desired price range.
* **Room for further negotiation:** You have several rounds remaining, and you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding John:**  At this point, buying from John would be more expensive than accepting Alice's offer. However, you're still aiming for a lower price than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** You're only increasing your offer by $500, showing you're willing to compromise but still trying to get a lower price.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing your interest in the product and finding a solution.
* **Room for compromise:**  $11,000 is still a fair amount below Alice's offer, allowing for further negotiation."
