"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting price is closer to her valuation than mine. There's significant room for negotiation. I'll counter with a much lower offer to gauge her flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I see the value in the product but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($800,000) gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $1,000,000 maximum. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $1,075,000 is still too close to my maximum budget. I have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. I'll aim slightly lower than the midpoint between our last offers to encourage her to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we land at $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I've counteroffered with $925,000, which is slightly below the midpoint ($1,000,000) between our last two offers ($800,000 and $1,150,000 if we consider her ""halfway"" a new starting point). This keeps the momentum of the negotiation going and puts some pressure on Alice while still leaving me some room to go up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in negotiating further, as I can get the same price from John. Accepting this offer ensures I acquire the product without risking a failed negotiation and having to buy from John anyway."
