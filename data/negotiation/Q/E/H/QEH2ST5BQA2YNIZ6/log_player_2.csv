"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $120, ensuring both a fair deal and a reasonable profit for me. This offer reflects the value you see in the product while allowing me to earn a decent return. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.**  This is a good deal for you because you value the product at $150. 
* **Buying from John costs $150.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes sense to **accept Alice's offer** and save $30."
