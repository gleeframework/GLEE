"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $130 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
