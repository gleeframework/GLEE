"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $130 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price than $110.  I know the product is worth more to Bob, so I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
