$20,000 is far too high. It's best to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer at $10,000. This is a more reasonable price point, considering my maximum budget is $8,000. We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

While $17,500 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $8,000."

While $16,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll keep negotiating with Alice, as I have a few rounds left to reach a good deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $14,000. This shows Alice I'm getting closer to her price point, but I'm still pushing for a better deal. We're now halfway through the negotiations, so I need to be strategic and get closer to my maximum budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Although $15,500 is getting closer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, as I'm starting to run out of time.  I'll need to carefully consider the risks of losing the deal to John and the potential of getting a better price from Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $14,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and I'm getting closer to her price point, but I'm still pushing for a better deal. With limited time remaining, it's important to find a compromise that works for both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is tempting, I still have one more round to negotiate.  I'll try one final counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal before I have to choose between Alice and John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14750}
``` 

This is my final counteroffer. I'm pushing for a price that's close to Alice's last offer but still within my budget.  I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us and that we can reach a final agreement.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
