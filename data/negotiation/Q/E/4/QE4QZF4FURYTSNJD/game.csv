"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know would be a valuable asset.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing it further. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the opening offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of this product, but that price point is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a significant difference from my initial asking price, I'm willing to move a bit to find common ground. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.  I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be honest, $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'd be willing to accept $980,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant price reduction on a truly valuable product.",980000.0,Alice,5,
