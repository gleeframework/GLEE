"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,001, which is just $1 above the value you've placed on it. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting at just $1 over your maximum price, it's worth seeing if you can get an even better deal. You have 10 rounds, and there's always the option to buy from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiations. While $1,200,001 is a fair price, I'm looking to maximize my savings. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would give us both a good deal, and leave room for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to your maximum price, it's still above what you're comfortable paying. There's still room for negotiation, and you have 7 rounds left. You can counteroffer with a lower price and try to reach a compromise closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, which would put us at $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is getting closer to your limit, but it's still a bit too high.  You've already gone through 4 rounds of negotiation, and while you have 6 more, it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice to go much lower.  

Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, it's more advantageous to buy from him now.  This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice not leading to a better deal."
