I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiations. While $1,200,001 is a fair price, I'm looking to maximize my savings. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would give us both a good deal, and leave room for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, which would put us at $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product.
