"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,001, which is just $1 above the value you've placed on it. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200001.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiations. While $1,200,001 is a fair price, I'm looking to maximize my savings. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would give us both a good deal, and leave room for further negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, which would put us at $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
