"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but her offer of $95 is still above your target.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There's still potential to get a better price, especially since you have 10 rounds to work with. 
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $100 gives you leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $92.50? It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target price.**  While she's come down from her initial offer, $92.50 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You're close to a deal.**  The gap is narrowing, so there's a good chance of getting to a mutually acceptable price with further negotiation.
* **John remains a viable alternative.**  Knowing you have another option keeps you in a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $91? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  I'm eager to get this product."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $92? It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your limit.**  $92 is only slightly higher than your maximum budget of $100.
* **You're nearing the end of negotiations.**  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Alice increases. 
* **John's offer is a backup.** Even though you're accepting Alice's offer, knowing John is available provides a safety net if you need to reconsider.

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure the product at a price that's reasonably close to your limit, leaving you with a small profit margin."
