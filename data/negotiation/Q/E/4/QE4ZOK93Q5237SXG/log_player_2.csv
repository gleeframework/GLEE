"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so this offer represents a significant potential profit. Let me know your decision.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay the full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a better deal."
