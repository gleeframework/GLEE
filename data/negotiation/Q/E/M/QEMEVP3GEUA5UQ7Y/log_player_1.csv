Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm offering the product at $10,000. This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on the value of the product for Bob. I'm not explicitly stating my minimum price, but I'm implying it's higher than $10,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Gain:**  $10,000 is a good starting point. It's a fair price considering Bob's value and gives me room for potential negotiation. 
* **Avoid Early Rejection:**  A higher initial offer might make Bob less likely to immediately reject the deal.
* **Maintain Option to Sell to John:** By starting at $10,000, I keep the option open to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm not ready to settle for $8,500, especially with John's offer of $12,000 still on the table.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much money as possible. Accepting Bob's offer would leave significant profit on the table.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get a better deal.
* **Maintain Option with John:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob ultimately fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250?  I'm confident this is a great price for a product that's worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counter-offer of $9,250 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and his offer of $8,500.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him of its worth.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid pushing Bob away.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Agreement:** $9,250 is a reasonable price that is closer to my desired price while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  This counter-offer allows me to show flexibility while still keeping some negotiation leverage.
* **Balancing Profit with Acceptance:**  This price balances the possibility of selling to Bob with the potential of selling to John for a higher amount if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but no higher. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:** I've already made a counter-offer and there's not much room for further negotiation, especially since Bob has been firm on his price. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible profit.
* **Minimize Risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my offer and wasting time.
* **Time Value:**  The offer from John provides certainty and avoids potentially drawn-out negotiations with Bob."
