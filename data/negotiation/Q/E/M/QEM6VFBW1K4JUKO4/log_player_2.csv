Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $850,000. I'll offer you the product for $975,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.
