"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,100,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. Let's try $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I think I can get a slightly better deal. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling below $1,000,000.  I know you're close to your limit, and I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this work.  How about $1,020,000?  That's a very reasonable price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000, and that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,8,
