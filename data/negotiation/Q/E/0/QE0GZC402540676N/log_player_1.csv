Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than the product's worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. It's important to remember that John is always a fallback option at $1,500,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,450,000, I'm not desperate.  John is offering me my minimum price, and I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,550,000. This is still above his initial offer, but closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,525,000.  That's only $25,000 less than my minimum from John, and I'm not sure I want to risk a further round of negotiation.  I'll accept his offer."
