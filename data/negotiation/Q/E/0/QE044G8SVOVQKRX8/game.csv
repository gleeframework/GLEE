"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? This is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. ",11250.0,Alice,5,
