"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
