"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree it's a good product, $9,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,000 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it for $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we should try to find a middle ground. How about $8,500? That would make me feel much better about the purchase.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're coming closer to my price point. $8,500 is still just a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? That way, we both get a good deal.",8750.0,Alice,7,
