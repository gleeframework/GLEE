{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the value and potential benefits of the product to entice Bob.  This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if there's a middle ground we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price still reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking of $11500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering that John is only offering $12,000.  This seems like a good compromise, and I'll accept his offer."
