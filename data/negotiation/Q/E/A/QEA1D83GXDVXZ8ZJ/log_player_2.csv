"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:** We're aiming to buy low.  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer helps gauge Alice's flexibility and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite & Direct:** We want to maintain a good rapport with Alice.
* **Strategic Aim:** Our offer of $7,000 is closer to Alice's value ($8,000). It will be interesting to see her response and how far she's willing to move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $9,000 is still a significant markup from her perceived value. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and we should try to push the price down further. It's too early to accept this offer, especially since we have the fallback option of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000 even? That seems like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're now aiming directly at Alice's perceived value.  This is a strong negotiating tactic, as it suggests a win-win situation while maximizing our potential savings. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will reveal if Alice is willing to sell at her perceived value or if she's determined to get a profit.
* **Time Consideration:** While we have rounds remaining, time is a factor. We need to start closing the gap if we want to avoid going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we discuss $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling:** Alice is stalling. She's rejected our attempt to settle at her perceived value and is trying to inch the price back up.
* **Not Budging:**  Her counter-offer of $9,500 shows she's not willing to budge much from her initial offers. 
* **Time to Apply Pressure:** We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price and might walk away if she doesn't become more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I need to be upfront.  $8,500 is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're establishing a firm limit while still leaving some room for Alice to potentially accept.  
* **Introducing Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we're subtly reminding Alice that we have John as a fallback.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, we need to convey a sense of urgency and encourage a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. How about we discuss $9,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:** Alice has effectively hit a wall. Her latest offer and her statement about not going below $10,000 signal that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Time:**  Even if we manage to get Alice down a little bit in the remaining rounds, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of missing out on a guaranteed price from John.
* **Certainty:** John offers a certain price of $12,000. While not ideal, it's within our budget and avoids the uncertainty of continued haggling with Alice, which could ultimately end up costing us more in the long run."
