"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  I know you're interested, and I believe this is a good opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.**  You're not getting a discount, so there's no advantage to accepting.
* **John offers the same price.** This means there's no benefit to buying from Alice.
* **The best course of action is to reject Alice's offer.**  This doesn't mean you won't buy the product, but it gives you leverage. By rejecting, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away. This could potentially lead to Alice lowering her price to secure the sale."
