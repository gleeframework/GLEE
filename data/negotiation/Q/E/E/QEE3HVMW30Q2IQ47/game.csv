"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85? Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  Would you consider $90? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $93?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $93 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $91?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really eager to get this product.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still a bit off on the price. How about $92? This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",92.0,Alice,7,
