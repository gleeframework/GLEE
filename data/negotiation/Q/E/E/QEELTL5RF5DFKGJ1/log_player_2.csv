"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer gives you the chance to potentially secure an even better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'll offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still within your budget.  Further negotiation may be possible, but it's risky.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
