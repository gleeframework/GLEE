"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates that you're serious about buying but also have a firm budget. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there's still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise.  It's a significant move from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. This could make Alice more likely to accept, as it shows he's genuinely interested."
