"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down, Alice.  I appreciate the compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is still a compromise, but closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",9000.0,Alice,5,
