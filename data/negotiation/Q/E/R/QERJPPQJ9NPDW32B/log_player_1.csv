"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a good incentive to consider the offer as it's significantly less than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try for a better price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
``` 

I'm counteroffering again with $88.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to get a slightly higher price.  This offer is also closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping that with only 5 rounds left, Bob will be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue rejecting offers. Bob's offer of $83 is very close to my minimum of $80, and I don't want to risk losing out on a deal altogether.  It's time to accept and secure the sale."
