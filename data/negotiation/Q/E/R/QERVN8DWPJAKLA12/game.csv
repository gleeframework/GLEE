,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $850,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  While I value your business, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you consider $860,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",860000.0,Bob,6,
