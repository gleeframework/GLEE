"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is far too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply not feasible for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This reflects the value of the product, while still giving you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17500 is still outside my range. I'm willing to pay $12500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $14,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $15,000."
