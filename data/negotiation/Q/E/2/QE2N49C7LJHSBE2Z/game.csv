"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply not feasible for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $17500. This reflects the value of the product, while still giving you a good deal.  What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17500 is still outside my range. I'm willing to pay $12500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's try to find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to close the deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
