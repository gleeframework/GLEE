Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which gives me some buffer if Bob counteroffers. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he rejects this offer, it shows he's unlikely to pay close to my minimum.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The difference between my offer and Bob's value gives us both space to bargain.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  My offer is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll counteroffer rather than walk away.

I'll evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I want to earn.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much better option at this point. However, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before making a decision.  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $900,000 with $1,000,000. This is a slight increase from his offer but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. By doing this, I'm:

* **Showing flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Keeping the pressure on:**  The offer is still higher than Bob's initial value, encouraging him to counter again.
* **Protecting my interests:**  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal, while leaving room for further negotiation. 

I'll assess Bob's response and determine if I need to adjust my strategy further or if I should consider selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I've shown flexibility in my negotiations, I'm not willing to compromise further at this point. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I achieve my desired earnings and avoids the potential for further rounds of negotiation that may not yield a favorable outcome."
