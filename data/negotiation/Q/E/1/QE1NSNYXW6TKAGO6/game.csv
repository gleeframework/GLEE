"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to stay within my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
