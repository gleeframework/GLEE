Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $800,000, which is far below my minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap. Accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 is the best way to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
