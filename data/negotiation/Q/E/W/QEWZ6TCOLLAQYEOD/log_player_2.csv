"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so anything higher than that is a bad deal for him.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob should start by offering a price that's closer to his target price of $8,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation. $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering Alice's value for the product is $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,800 is closer to his target, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $9,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  He's still below his alternative price of $8,000, so he's not taking a huge risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,200 is closer to his target price of $8,000, he still has the option of buying the product from John for a significantly lower price. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

Bob should increase his offer again, but only slightly to $9,200. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but is still pushing for a lower price. It's important to keep his offers close to his target price of $8,000, as he can always buy the product from John if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $10,500 is higher than his target price of $8,000.  While he could continue to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee he'll be able to get a lower price within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product from John for a guaranteed price."
