"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts.
* **Value to Bob:** My message acknowledges the value of the product to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate by ending the message with a question."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I still have room for negotiation.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $18,000.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation. It shows I'm not desperate and willing to wait for a better offer.
* **Assess Bob's Willingness:** By rejecting, I can gauge how far Bob is willing to go to secure the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not drastically.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price point and appeal to Bob's rational side.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and cooperative tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $15,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiating Room:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob won't go above $15,000, and I'm unwilling to drop below $16,500.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already in Round 4, meaning I have limited time to secure a better price.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's not my desired $18,000, it's a sure thing.

With limited time and the risk of further negotiation going nowhere, it's better to secure the guaranteed sale to John."
