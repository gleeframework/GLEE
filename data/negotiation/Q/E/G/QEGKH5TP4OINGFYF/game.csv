"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $11,500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $12,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's call it a day at $12,500.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm very close to your offer, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about $12,250?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",12250.0,Bob,8,
