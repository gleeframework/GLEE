"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1300000 is simply too low. I'm prepared to come down to $1600000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1450000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1550000. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
