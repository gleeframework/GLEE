Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise considering its potential for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your desired price while keeping the deal within my reach. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's better to cut losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000 rather than risk Bob not reaching the $1,000,000 mark within the remaining rounds."
