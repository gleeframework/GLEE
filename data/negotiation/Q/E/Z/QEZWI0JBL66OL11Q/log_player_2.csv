Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise considering its potential for you.
