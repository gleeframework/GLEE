"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,500. It's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think about $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
