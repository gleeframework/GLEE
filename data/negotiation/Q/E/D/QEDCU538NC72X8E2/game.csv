"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,
