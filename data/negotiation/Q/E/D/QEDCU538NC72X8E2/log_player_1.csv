Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your $8,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's less than Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so this gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can still increase the price if Bob makes a counteroffer that's too low.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000."", ""product_price"": 9500}
