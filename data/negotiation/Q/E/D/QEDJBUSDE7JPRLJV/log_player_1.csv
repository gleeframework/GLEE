{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit, and leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to try to get closer to my goal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $135? It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $132.50 is a decent compromise that still nets me a profit.  It's also better than selling to John for $120, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
