"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal is to save money.** While Alice's offer is lower than John's, you can still do better.
* **You value the product at $150, but Alice values it at $120.** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer puts you in a stronger position.** You can use the threat of buying from John to push Alice to lower her price further."
