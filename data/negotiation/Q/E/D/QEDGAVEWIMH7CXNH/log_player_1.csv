Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $110 is more than your $80 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's a potential for him to counteroffer and meet you somewhere in between.
* **It's a fair initial offer:**  By not starting too high, you avoid immediately shutting down negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price point.  There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.  By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, considering how much you value the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  By dropping the price to $100, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Appeal to value:**  Highlighting the value Bob places on the product ($120) reinforces the potential bargain he's getting.
* **Positive language:**  Using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""appreciate your interest"" keeps the tone friendly and encourages continued negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 isn't your ideal price, it's:

* **Above your minimum:** You're still making more than the $80 you'd get from John.
* **Close to your target:** You're only $5 away from your initial $100 offer.
* **A reasonable compromise:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and meeting in the middle is a fair outcome. 

Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether, or having to settle for John's offer, outweighs the potential gain from a few more dollars."
