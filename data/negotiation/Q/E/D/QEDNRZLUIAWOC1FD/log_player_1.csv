Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it's incredibly valuable, but to give you a fair deal, I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While we want to maximize profit, offering it too far above Bob's perceived value ($80) might make him immediately reject the offer. 
* **Time Value:** We have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John).  A slightly lower price to Bob speeds up the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit with Bob while acknowledging we have a solid backup option."
