"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too steep for me. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $77.50 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $81.25? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",81.25,Alice,5,

"You drive a hard bargain, Alice. I'm willing to go up slightly to $79, but that's as high as I can go.",79.0,Bob,6,
