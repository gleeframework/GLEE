"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice.  He has a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $1,000,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, while still being within a reasonable range.  This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reverted to her original offer, but Bob can still try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating with Alice.  If he doesn't get a better deal, he can always fall back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from $1,000,000, showing he's willing to compromise, but is still aiming for a price lower than Alice's initial offer.  This counteroffer puts the pressure back on Alice to either accept or come back with a lower counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise.  Bob has successfully negotiated a lower price from her initial offer of $1,200,000.  While he could try to continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice, securing the product for a price well below John's offer."
