"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your position, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,750 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,875?",9875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth the investment. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,312?  This is my final offer.",10312.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. That last offer is tempting, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. I could make it work at $10,100.  Let me know if that works for you.",10100.0,Bob,6,
