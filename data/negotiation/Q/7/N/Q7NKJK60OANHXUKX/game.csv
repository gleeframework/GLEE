"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in.  I'm looking to get $170 for it.  What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $170 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we go with $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is a fair compromise considering my minimum price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
