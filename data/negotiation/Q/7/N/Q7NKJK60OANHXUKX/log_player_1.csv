"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in.  I'm looking to get $170 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get close to my minimum value right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $170 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we go with $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$130 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'll counter with a price that's a little closer to my minimum and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is a fair compromise considering my minimum price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're running out of time.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price than risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate."
