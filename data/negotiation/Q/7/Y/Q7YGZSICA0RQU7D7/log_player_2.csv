"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  He has 10 rounds, so there's room to try and push Alice down further.  Plus, knowing John is willing to sell for $10,000 gives Bob leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his counteroffer strategy by aiming for a price that's closer to his ideal price of $10,000 but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  He's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a good deal.  He's using the knowledge that John will sell for $10,000 as leverage, but he's also aware that he has 10 rounds to reach an agreement, so he doesn't want to be too aggressive in the early stages."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $11,500, the offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's target of $10,000. He has multiple rounds left and knows he can get the product from John for a guaranteed $10,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.  He's aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, showing he's serious about a deal. The $10,750 offer is also a midpoint between his last offer and Alice's last offer, suggesting a compromise.  This tactic could potentially lead to a deal in the next round, especially as the rounds are decreasing.  However, he still has the safety net of buying from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still not quite there.  Bob has several rounds left and is aware that John will sell the product for $10,000.  With the number of rounds decreasing, Bob can risk pushing for a slightly lower price and potentially get a better deal in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10600} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again adjusting his offer to be a midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This strategy shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate, but he's also sticking to his budget.  He's approaching his target price but still has the option to buy from John if he doesn't get the desired deal.  As rounds are dwindling,  he's taking a slightly more aggressive approach, aiming to finalize the deal within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is now within Bob's budget and is a good deal considering his goal to save as much money as possible.  While he could potentially try to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at $10,000 is higher now that there are only a few rounds left. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that is within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
