Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a favorable price and the guaranteed option of selling to John."
