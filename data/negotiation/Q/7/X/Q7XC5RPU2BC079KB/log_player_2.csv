Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to compromise at $155, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to reach a price that beats John's offer of $150.  It's better to secure the product at the best known price than risk Alice not going any lower."
