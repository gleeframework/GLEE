,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I can't go any lower than $10,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. It's our last chance to come to an agreement. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really need to make sure I'm getting a good deal on this product.",9200.0,Bob,6,
