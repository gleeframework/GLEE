"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price that is still beneficial to me, but also leaves room for negotiation. It's important to show that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell it for that low, and I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I can't go any lower than $10,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. It's our last chance to come to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really need to make sure I'm getting a good deal on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions and am getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Since John is willing to pay my desired price, it's more beneficial to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
