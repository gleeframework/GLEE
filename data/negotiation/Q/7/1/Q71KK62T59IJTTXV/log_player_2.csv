"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product holds for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can offer you a price of $11,500, which is a compromise that I think is still reasonable, considering the product's value to you.

Round 6

# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up more than $1,000 from my initial offer. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is the midpoint between my initial offer and your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To make a deal, I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price that is closer to our positions and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're in the final stretch, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $10,750 offer, but I'm not going to give up more. I can offer you a price of $10,875, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can wrap this up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the closest she's gotten to your ideal price point.** You're only $875 over your target.
* **You have only one round left.** There's little time to negotiate further, and you risk losing the deal altogether.
* **It's likely that Alice will not go any lower in the final round.** This is likely her final offer, especially as you've shown your willingness to go up to $10,750.
* **Buying from John at $15,000 would be significantly more expensive.** This offer is a much better deal, even if it's not perfect.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent decision. You'll save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and you'll still secure the product within your budget."
