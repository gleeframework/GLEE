"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see potential in this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, but I need to be sure the value justifies that. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This price still allows me to make a worthwhile return while offering you a significant opportunity. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm still interested, $1500000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
