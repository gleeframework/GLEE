"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds intriguing, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $700000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $710000.  It's a fair price for both parties.",710000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $710000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $720000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",720000.0,Alice,5,
