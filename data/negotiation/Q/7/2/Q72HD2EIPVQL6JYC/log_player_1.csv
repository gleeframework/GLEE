"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal and I think you'll really enjoy it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob values the product at ($120).  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not asking for my full desired price of $150 right away. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives us both some wiggle room. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:** I'm not dropping too much from my previous offer. $130 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $130 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the potential value of the product.
* **Keeping the conversation open:**  My message invites Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $110? That's a fair price and I'm eager to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is on my side:** We have several rounds left.  I'm not desperate to sell right now.  

I'll make another counteroffer, but this time I'll be a little more firm. I need to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** This time, I'm not dropping my price as much. I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting closer to my minimum.
* **""Meet you halfway"" strategy:** By suggesting $125, I'm framing it as a compromise and a fair midpoint between our last offers.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal,"" subtly reminding Bob that time is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer to my limit. I can do $115, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Few rounds left:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation. I still have time to try to push for a better price.

I'll make a counteroffer, but I'll try to be firm and stick closer to my target price.  I'm not willing to sell below $125 yet, but I need to be strategic about my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be at $120 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. If you're serious about making this happen, let's close this deal at $120."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm not dropping to Bob's offer, but I'm also not asking for a drastic increase. $120 is a compromise that shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to solidify his understanding that this is a good price for him.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a bit more urgency by emphasizing ""closing the deal"" and asking if he's ""serious"".  This encourages him to make a final decision."
