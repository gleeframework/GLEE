"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $100.  It's a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should always aim for the best possible price."
