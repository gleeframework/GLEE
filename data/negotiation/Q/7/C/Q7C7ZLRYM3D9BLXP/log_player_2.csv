"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Since Bob is willing to pay $10,000, there's room for a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $10000 was a bit high.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $8500 for the product. That would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  Alice has already lowered the price, but there's still room for further negotiation."
