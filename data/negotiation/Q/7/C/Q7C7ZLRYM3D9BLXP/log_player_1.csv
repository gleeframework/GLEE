{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the message in a way that's friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message clearly indicates I'm open to discussing the price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider:

* **His Counteroffer:**  If his counteroffer is reasonable, I may accept it. If not, I'll make a counter-counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll consider John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is still higher than $7,500 but less than my initial offer of $10,000. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $10,000 was a bit high.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $8,500 for the product. That would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $8,500 represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize fairness and a win-win scenario to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, it still leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to: 

* **Make Another Counteroffer:**  If I believe there's still room for negotiation, I'll consider making a slightly lower counteroffer.
* **Accept John's Offer:** If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll  accept John's offer of $8,000 to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8000.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential Loss:** While I could potentially negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that could lead to me accepting John's offer of $8,000 anyway.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
