"I'm very interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is too low for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
