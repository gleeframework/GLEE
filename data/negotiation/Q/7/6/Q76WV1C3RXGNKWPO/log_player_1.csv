"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable number."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to come down on my price, but not to that extent."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is too low for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Finding a Compromise:**  I've significantly lowered my initial ask to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above my minimum while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer now matches what John is offering. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations with Bob, as I'm unlikely to secure a better price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and clean deal at my minimum acceptable price."
