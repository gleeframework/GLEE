Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $120.  It's a great deal on a valuable item!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Anchor the Price:** By starting with $120, you set a high initial value in Bob's mind, making $80 (your fallback price) seem like a better deal later if needed. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, you can lower the price. If he counters, you know he's serious.

**Important:** It's crucial to remain flexible and be prepared to negotiate with Bob. You have a guaranteed sale at $80, so use that as your safety net."
