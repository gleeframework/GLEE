"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than what you've estimated. However, I understand everyone has their own valuation. Would you be interested in exploring a deal closer to its true value? I'm open to negotiation but would appreciate if we could come to an agreement that respects both our perspectives. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
