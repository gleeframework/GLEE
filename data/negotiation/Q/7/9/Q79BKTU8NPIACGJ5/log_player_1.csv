Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows room for potential compromise. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable and worth a significant investment.  We'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000, so I'm not willing to accept it.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm still above my minimum price, but I'm showing a willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $800,000.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long and potentially unproductive negotiation.  John is offering my minimum price, which is a guaranteed sale, and I'm going to take that option."
