"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? This offer still represents significant value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit much. Would you consider $980,000?  That's a significant move on my part.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,015,000? That's my final offer.",1015000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  How about we make one final adjustment and settle at $1,000,000 even? This ensures we both feel we got a fair deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
