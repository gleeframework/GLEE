"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for concessions and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,600,000, we're setting a high anchor. While Bob might counter significantly lower, it frames the negotiation within a range where our target price ($1,200,000) seems more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling that we're flexible and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our valuation and his own stated value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for us. It's important to demonstrate that we're willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing what we're selling. Proceeding to the next round allows us to counter with a price that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the product's value. While I understand your initial offer, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential to benefit your business."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While we're not accepting Bob's low offer, we're demonstrating willingness to negotiate by making a significant price reduction of $200,000. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes that our concession is substantial and reinforces the product's value proposition, reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We're still aiming above our minimum price ($1,200,000), leaving room for further negotiation while signaling that we're not desperate to sell at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm glad you see the value I bring as a potential buyer. To be honest,  $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
