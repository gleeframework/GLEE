"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It makes much more sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim low to start:**  Since Alice started very high, we need to bring the price down significantly. Offering slightly above half her asking price achieves this and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Stay below your limit:**  It's important to stay well below your $1,000,000 limit for now. This gives you bargaining power and allows for compromises as the negotiation continues."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the product's value. While I understand your initial offer, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential to benefit your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high.  We need to show her we're serious about a lower price point.  Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm glad you see the value I bring as a potential buyer. To be honest,  $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** We are increasing our offer, demonstrating that we are negotiating in good faith and willing to move towards a deal.
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering $1,100,000 puts us above the middle point between her last offer ($1,400,000) and our last offer ($800,000). This gives us some bargaining room while still aiming for a price well below her initial ask.
* **Nearing your limit:** This offer is getting close to your upper limit, putting pressure on Alice to seriously consider it."
