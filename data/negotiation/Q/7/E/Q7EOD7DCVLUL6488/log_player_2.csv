"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $100 is a good starting point, but there's potential to get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It's still a reasonable price, considering your maximum budget is $150. This will hopefully incentivize Alice to counter with a price closer to your target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still higher than your desired price.  While it's closer to your target, you have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price. Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but we're still above my target price. This counteroffer of $80 shows a continued desire to compromise while also demonstrating that I'm willing to walk away if needed.  It's a small step towards a final agreement, hopefully encouraging Alice to accept or make a more reasonable counter-offer."
