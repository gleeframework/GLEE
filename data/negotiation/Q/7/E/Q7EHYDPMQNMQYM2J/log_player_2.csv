"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's no point in accepting it. It's better to counter-offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. To start our negotiation, I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  $1,900,000 is well over my budget of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value I see in this product and my financial constraints. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm prepared to consider a price of $1,700,000, which represents a substantial compromise on my end. I believe this price offers a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still way above my budget. I'm not willing to pay $1,700,000. I'll keep trying to negotiate a lower price, but I'm getting closer to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that we're still quite far apart on price. To make progress, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this product while respecting my budget limitations."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your commitment to this deal is appreciated.  I'm willing to make one final concession to bridge the gap. I can accept $1,550,000 for the product. This is a firm offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,550,000 is still too high for my budget. While we're getting closer, it's not worth risking further negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $800,000. It's a guaranteed deal that fits my budget."
