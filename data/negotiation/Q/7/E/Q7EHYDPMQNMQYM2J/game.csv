"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find an agreement that benefits both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. To start our negotiation, I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value I see in this product and my financial constraints. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm prepared to consider a price of $1,700,000, which represents a substantial compromise on my end. I believe this price offers a fair deal for both parties.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're still quite far apart on price. To make progress, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this product while respecting my budget limitations.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your commitment to this deal is appreciated.  I'm willing to make one final concession to bridge the gap. I can accept $1,550,000 for the product. This is a firm offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
