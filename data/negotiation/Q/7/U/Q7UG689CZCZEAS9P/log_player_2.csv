"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go over $8,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $9,200 to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,200 is better than $10,000, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go to $8,800.  This is the highest I can go, let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
