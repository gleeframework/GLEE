"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision here.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Let me think about it... How about we meet in the middle between $1050000 and my initial offer of $1200000? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $1070000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's say... $1075000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $1070000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher. Can you accept?",1070000.0,Bob,8,
