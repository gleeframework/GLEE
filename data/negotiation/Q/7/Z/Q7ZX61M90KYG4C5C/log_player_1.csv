Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value is around $12,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning a perceived value of $12,000, Alice provides a reference point for Bob and justifies the asking price of $10,000.
* **Alternative Option:** While Alice has John as a backup, she doesn't mention him. This keeps the focus on Bob as the preferred buyer and avoids showing her hand too early. 
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is friendly and encourages a response from Bob, opening the door for further negotiation if needed."
