"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I can try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $900,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still outside my budget.  While I value the product, I'm not willing to go above my maximum of $800,000.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid further negotiation."
