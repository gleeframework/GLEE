"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
