""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, and you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, so any price Bob accepts above that is a win.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. This price point is likely to be attractive to Bob while also being significantly higher than your fallback option."
