"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

$9,250 is a good price for the product and is within your budget.  There's no reason to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
