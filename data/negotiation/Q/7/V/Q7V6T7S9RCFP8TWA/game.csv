"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, considering the value you place on it, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in your price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  I believe this price is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  Let's try to close this deal, I'm ready to move forward.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the deal. I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and dedicated support, to sweeten the deal. I'm confident that this will be a great value for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,045,000.",1045000.0,Alice,5,
