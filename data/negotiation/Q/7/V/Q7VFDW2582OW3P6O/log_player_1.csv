Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $100 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him a potential saving and incentivizing him to accept.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price if he's willing to go further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still below the midpoint between your minimum and Bob's value.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. It shows you're willing to compromise but still maintain a price that's more favorable to you.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes your willingness to negotiate.  It also frames the offer as a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

This counteroffer increases your chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price while still being within the potential value range for both parties."
