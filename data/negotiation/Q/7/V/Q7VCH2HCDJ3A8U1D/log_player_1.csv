I reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $8,000 as the price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's my minimum price and it's a guaranteed sale. Selling to John would net me the same amount, so I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
