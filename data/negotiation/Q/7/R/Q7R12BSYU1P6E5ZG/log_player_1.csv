"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer positively, focusing on the product's value and suggesting a fair price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message clearly implies that I'm open to discussion and am willing to negotiate. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while also engaging Bob in a dialogue that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to pay more than his perceived value.  There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Exploring options:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price before resorting to selling to John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a better price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value our conversation, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise, highlighting the mutual benefit.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward by offering a specific counteroffer.

By proposing $9,500, I'm aiming to inch closer to my desired price while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe $9,200 could be a fair price for both of us. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  $9,200 is still below my minimum desired value of $12,000. 
* **More rounds left:** We're only in round 4, so there's still time to see if I can push Bob further.
* **John's offer:** While John is willing to pay my desired price, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and try to secure a better price, while still having the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's aim for $9,400.  It's just a small increase from your offer, but it would allow me to continue with this negotiation."", ""product_price"": 9400} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  I'm offering a small increase to show flexibility, but not drastically altering my position.
* **Focus on negotiation:**  I'm reiterating my willingness to work with Bob and highlighting that I'm actively trying to reach a deal.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  I'm continuing the negotiation process with a specific counteroffer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price. Considering my budget and the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,300. This seems to be a reasonable compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  $9,300 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000.
* **Limited rounds left:**  We're in round 6, so we have fewer rounds left to push for a better price. However, John's offer provides a safety net.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for us to find common ground.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I continue to explore the possibility of getting a higher price while keeping John's offer as a backup option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm always open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $9,350. It's a small adjustment, but it would allow me to move forward with this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm offering a small increase to show flexibility and demonstrate that I'm actively working towards a deal.  
* **Focus on Compromise:**  My message emphasizes a desire for a solution that benefits both parties, making it less likely Bob will feel pressured.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, I want to push for a slightly higher price while still keeping the negotiation open.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in negotiating. Based on my budget and the product's value, I would like to propose a final offer of $9,325. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal.
* **Significant Difference:**  $9,325 is still a considerable distance from my minimum desired value of $12,000. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay my target price, securing a significantly better outcome for me.

While I've been successful in pushing Bob towards a higher price, the remaining time and potential for significant gains are limited. Selling to John provides a secure and profitable outcome, so I'll take advantage of his offer."
