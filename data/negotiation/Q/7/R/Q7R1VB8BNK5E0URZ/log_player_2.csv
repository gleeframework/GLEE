"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe you'll find this price very competitive, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is ""competitive"" based on the product's worth to Bob, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy from John for a lower price and stay within his budget."
