"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my range, but I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
