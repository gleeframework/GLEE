"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you offering it. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500 for this product.  Would you be willing to go that low? ",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,250, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
