Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $800,000 to make this worthwhile. 
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves room for negotiation between $800,000 and $1,500,000.
* **Strategic offer:** Offering $1,200,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, giving Bob a good deal while still leaving room for potential negotiation. 

By offering this price, I am aiming for a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
