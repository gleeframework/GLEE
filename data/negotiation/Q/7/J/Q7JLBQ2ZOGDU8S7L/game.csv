"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I'm looking for $180 for it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160, but that's the lowest I can go.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $140. If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to consider other options.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise at $155, but that's as low as I can go.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that, otherwise I'll have to move on.",150.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $150, but I've already received an offer from another buyer who is willing to pay the minimum price I'm looking for, which is $150. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160, but I'm not going any higher.",160.0,Alice,7,
