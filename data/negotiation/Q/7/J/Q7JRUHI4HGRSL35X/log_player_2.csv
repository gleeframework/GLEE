Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is far above Bob's budget.  He needs to counter-offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. He should counter-offer again to try and get the price closer to his target."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. Let's aim for $990,000. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with each offer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $990,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at $975,000. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can get even closer to the sweet spot. I'll meet you at $985,000, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there are only a few rounds left.  It's unlikely that they will reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Buying from John will guarantee Bob gets the product for the price he set as his maximum."
