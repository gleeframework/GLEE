"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could greatly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its unique features and high quality, I estimate its value to be significantly more than $8000. Considering this, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a special price of $12000. This is a limited-time opportunity, so please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at $12,000, which is your limit.  Since you have another option to buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to buying from Alice. You might be able to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price, but there's no guarantee. Buying from John guarantees you the product for your maximum price."
