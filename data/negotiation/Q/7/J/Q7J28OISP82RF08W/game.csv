"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique value, and it allows us both to secure a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can we meet in the middle again?",975000.0,Bob,6,
