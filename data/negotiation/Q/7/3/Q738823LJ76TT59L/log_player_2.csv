Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $640,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $658,000? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $658,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $658,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice is clearly committed to incremental concessions. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are likely to be small. Accepting the $658,000 offer secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's alternative price."
