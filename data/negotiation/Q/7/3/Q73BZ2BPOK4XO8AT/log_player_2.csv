Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I can do $11,000, but I think I need to get closer to my target price. Can you really only offer $10,250?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation window, and Alice seems to be signaling some flexibility. By rejecting this offer, we can apply more pressure and see if she's willing to drop her price even further."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is the best I can do.  I think that's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are."",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're entering the final stages of negotiation. This offer splits the difference between our previous offer and her last offer, signaling firmness while still showing a willingness to compromise. It also introduces a slight sense of urgency to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit worried that we won't reach a deal, Bob. I can do $11,500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a high-stakes play. Alice has signaled this is her final offer, but it's still above our ideal price. By rejecting it, we're gambling that she's bluffing and will be willing to negotiate in the final round rather than lose the sale. There's a risk she'll stick to her price, forcing us to buy from John, but the potential savings make it worth the gamble."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you know I'm serious about buying this product, and I've been fair in my offers. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's absolutely my limit.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd hate to see this fall apart now."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is the final round, and we need to play our best hand. We're increasing our offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but we're also holding firm to a price below her ""final offer."" The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer and the potential loss if the deal falls through, hoping to nudge Alice towards accepting.  It's a calculated risk, as she might not budge, but it gives us the best chance of securing a favorable price."
