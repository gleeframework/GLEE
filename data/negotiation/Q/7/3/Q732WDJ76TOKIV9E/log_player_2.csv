"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $850,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $820,000, which is still a profitable deal for Alice (she values it at $800,000). This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a lower price. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $840,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer, and it's possible that he could end up paying more if he keeps rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price without risking a higher cost or wasting time on further negotiation."
