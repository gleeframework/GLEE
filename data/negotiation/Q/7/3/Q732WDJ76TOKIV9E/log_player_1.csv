Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say... $850,000.

{""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'll reject it and try to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

Let's say... I'll offer the product to Bob at a price of $840,000. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but lower than my initial offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:
