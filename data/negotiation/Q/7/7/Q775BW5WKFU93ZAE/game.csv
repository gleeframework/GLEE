"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just too low for me. How about $105? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm flexible and willing to meet in the middle. How about $100? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I think you'd be very happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
