Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making it clear that this is a good deal for him.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm subtly mentioning the other buyer, John, to create a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, showing that I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a higher price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Rejecting his offer allows me to set a counteroffer and potentially drive the price closer to my desired range.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing John's offer of $800,000 provides a safety net, giving me the flexibility to walk away if the negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiating:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to give away the product for a price too far below my initial offer.
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a clear compromise from my initial price, demonstrating good faith and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm lowering the price, it's still above John's offer, giving me a fallback option if Bob rejects my counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $950,000, Alice. While that's closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is only $75,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While it's not ideal, there's still a possibility of pushing for a higher price in future rounds. However, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the potential of losing the deal altogether.  

**Conclusion:** Given the current negotiation dynamic, accepting Bob's offer appears to be the most pragmatic choice, as it secures a sale close to my minimum acceptable price without risking the deal falling apart."
