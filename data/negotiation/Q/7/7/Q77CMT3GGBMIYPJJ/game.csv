"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $950,000, Alice. While that's closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
