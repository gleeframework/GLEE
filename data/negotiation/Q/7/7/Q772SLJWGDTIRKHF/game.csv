"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a unique and high-demand item that I'm confident you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it immediately.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and my minimum price threshold.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a good value for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Bob,6,
