"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can get this deal done!",10500.0,Bob,4,
