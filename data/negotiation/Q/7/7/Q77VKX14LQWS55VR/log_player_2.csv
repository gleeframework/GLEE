* There's potential to get a better price from Alice."

{""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still high for you, leaving significant room for negotiation.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

* Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product at a reasonable price without the risk of losing the deal."
