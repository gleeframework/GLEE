# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by our previous customers. Given its exceptional quality and features, it's worth more than $120 to us. Considering its value to you, we're offering it at a special price of $140. This is an opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a reasonable cost. If this meets your expectations, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $140, while John is selling it for $150.  
* **The offer is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $10."
