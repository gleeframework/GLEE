"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing $1,000,000. This offer represents a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $850,000 is appealing, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $925,000? This feels like a fair deal given the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  That said, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to settle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $875,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,7,
