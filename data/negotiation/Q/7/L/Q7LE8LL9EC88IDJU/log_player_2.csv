Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $875,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? This is my final offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While $900,000 is a reasonable price and a good deal below Alice's initial offer, it's still more than John is offering.  Since saving money is the goal, it makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
