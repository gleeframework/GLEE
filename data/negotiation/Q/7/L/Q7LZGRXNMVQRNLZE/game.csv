"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still takes into account the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a worthwhile purchase. I'm hopeful that you'll consider my offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to work with you to get there. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'll counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,110,000 is the best price for this product.
