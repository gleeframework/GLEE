"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $110.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. Can we meet at $107? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise. How about we split the difference at $109? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
