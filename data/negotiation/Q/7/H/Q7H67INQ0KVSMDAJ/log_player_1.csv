Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. Here's why:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $95 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Attractive for Bob:**  $95 is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $100.
* **Reduces risk:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $80, minimizing your potential loss."
