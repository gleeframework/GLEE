"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for something slightly higher. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,600, which I believe is a fair compromise between our previous offers. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",12600.0,Bob,6,
