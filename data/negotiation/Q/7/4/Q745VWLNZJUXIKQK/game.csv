"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $145? That seems like a fair compromise.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $152.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $152.50 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $148.  If that works for you, we can close the deal.",148.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $148 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. That's the best I can do.",150.0,Alice,7,
