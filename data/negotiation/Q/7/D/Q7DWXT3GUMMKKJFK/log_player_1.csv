Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

Let's see how Bob responds to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I can consider. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $17,000. I would like to propose a price of $14,000 if that would be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $14,000 is finally above my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, accepting now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
