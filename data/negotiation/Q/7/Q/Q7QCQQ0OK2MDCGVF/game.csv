"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $100. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $175. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, but I think it's still a great deal for the value you'll get from the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I'm still unable to meet at $175. Could you perhaps consider $150? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
