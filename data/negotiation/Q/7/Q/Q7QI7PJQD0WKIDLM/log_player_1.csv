Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $850,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but my valuation of the product is considerably higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value and potential of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $950,000 is my final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price. Waiting and negotiating further carries the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling. John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a reasonable profit and avoids further negotiation hassle."
