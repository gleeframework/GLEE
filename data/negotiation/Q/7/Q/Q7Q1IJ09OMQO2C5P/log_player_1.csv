Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,500 is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  I'm confident in my $10,000 backup offer from John, but selling to Bob at a higher price is ideal."
