"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the industry. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good starting point, but $900,000 is still a hefty price. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $750,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not convinced that $825,000 is the best price.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $825,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $800,000, but that's my final offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made a significant concession by offering $825000, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to sweeten the deal. I can offer you $820000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly committed to a price close to $820,000. I'm only $20,000 away from my ideal price, and it's not worth risking another round to potentially lose the deal. Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice here."
