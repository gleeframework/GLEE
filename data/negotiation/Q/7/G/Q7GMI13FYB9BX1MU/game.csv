"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth the investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
