Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to see if he's willing to negotiate. It's important to remember that I can always go to John for $150, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable value of $150. I believe this counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I've already had one counteroffer rejected, so I'm not confident that we can reach an agreement. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's a guaranteed profit and a more efficient use of my time."
