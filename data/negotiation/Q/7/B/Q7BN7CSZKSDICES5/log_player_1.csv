Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 gives Bob a small discount ($10 off his perceived value) while maximizing your potential profit. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Why not other prices?**

* **Lower Prices (e.g., $80-$109):**  Leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Higher Prices (e.g., $115 or more):** Increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to sell to John for $80."
