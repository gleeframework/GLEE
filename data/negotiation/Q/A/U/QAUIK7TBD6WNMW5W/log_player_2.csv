"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds equal value for you. I'm offering it to you at a price that's slightly above my minimum, to ensure a fair transaction for both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $1,050,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to secure a solid return.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly above her minimum, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product for a lower price."
