"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is aiming to maximize his savings, so he starts with a significant counteroffer below Alice's initial price.
* **Reasoning:**  He provides a reason for the lower price, highlighting that he's looking for a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Bob ends with a question, signaling he's open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a gap of $1,000. This gap is significant enough to continue negotiating.
* **Exploring further options:**  Continuing the negotiation allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price.
* **Avoiding John's high price:**  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps Bob from automatically going to John's $15,000 price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,500. This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway, indicating a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fair Deal:** Emphasizing ""both get a good deal"" reinforces the win-win aspect and encourages Alice to be more flexible.
* **Specific Offer:**  $10,500 is a concrete proposal, demonstrating a willingness to be precise in negotiations."
