"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for your company, and I believe it's worth $2,000,000. Let's start the conversation with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to us, but I need to see a price that reflects its actual worth in our current market. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's crucial we find a compromise that respects both our needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, acknowledging the value it holds for your company. This offer reflects a significant discount from my initial proposal, and I hope you'll see it as a fair starting point for further discussion.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we're still quite a ways apart on this.  To be frank, anything above $1,200,000 just isn't going to work for my budget.  I'm confident this product can bring us mutual success, but I need a price that makes sense for us right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000 and get this deal done?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects a substantial concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to close this deal and ensure both of our businesses benefit.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to understand that $1,400,000 is really pushing my limit. This purchase needs to make financial sense for us, and I can't go any higher than $1,250,000.  I'm demonstrating my seriousness by holding firm here. Let's find an agreement that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution, but $1,250,000 unfortunately doesn't work for me. We're getting closer, but we still need to find a price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer is a sincere attempt to bridge the gap, and I hope you'll see it as a sign of my willingness to make this deal happen. Let's keep talking and find a solution that benefits both our businesses.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I acknowledge your willingness to negotiate, but we need to be realistic.  $1,350,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with.  My absolute limit is $1,275,000. This is a significant investment for us, and I need you to meet me halfway to make this work.  Let's close this deal today.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
