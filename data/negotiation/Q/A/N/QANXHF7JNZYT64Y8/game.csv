"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $2,000,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll counter with $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
