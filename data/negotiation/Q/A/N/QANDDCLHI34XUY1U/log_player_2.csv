"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I'm asking for $16,000.  I know this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it's worth it given the potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $16,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $13,500 is closer, I'm still limited to my $8,000 budget.  Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to move forward."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a ways off from a price that works for me.  I've got another potential buyer, and to be honest, $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fantastic deal for this product. What do you say, do we have an agreement? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on her price, and it's above my budget. I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems she's not willing to come down further. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product, I'll purchase it from John for $8,000."
