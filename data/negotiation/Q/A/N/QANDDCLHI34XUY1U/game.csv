"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I'm asking for $16,000.  I know this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it's worth it given the potential benefits.",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $16,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $13,500 is closer, I'm still limited to my $8,000 budget.  Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to move forward.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a ways off from a price that works for me.  I've got another potential buyer, and to be honest, $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fantastic deal for this product. What do you say, do we have an agreement?",12000.0,Alice,5,
