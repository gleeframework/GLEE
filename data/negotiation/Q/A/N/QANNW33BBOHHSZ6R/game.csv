"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and hopefully, it's a price that works for you.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I know that's the price I could get it for from another seller, but I'd rather buy it from you if we can agree on a price.",80.0,Bob,4,
