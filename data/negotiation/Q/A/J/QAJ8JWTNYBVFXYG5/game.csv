"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but I think that price is a little high for what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think $900,000 is still a bit too low for the value this product brings. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle on $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  How about we make it $1,000,000 even?  That feels like a good compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I can see you're getting close to a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's the lowest I can go without compromising the product's value. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to move a little on my end to finalize this. What if we split the difference and land at $1,007,500? That feels fair and would let us wrap this up.",1007500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,007,500. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,012,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,9,
