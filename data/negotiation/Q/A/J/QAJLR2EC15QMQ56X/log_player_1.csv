{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I can still get a good price from Bob while acknowledging the value the product holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and it gives you some room to negotiate. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $15,000, so I will reject it.  I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fair compromise, considering your valuation and my minimum price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
