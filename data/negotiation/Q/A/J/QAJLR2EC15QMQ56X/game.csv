"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and it gives you some room to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fair compromise, considering your valuation and my minimum price.  Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,
