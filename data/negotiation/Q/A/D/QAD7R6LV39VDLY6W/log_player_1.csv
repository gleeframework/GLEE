I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for significant negotiation room. I believe the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, and I'm aiming to get as close to that value as possible.  By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is a decent sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. I hope this shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I initially aimed for a higher price, Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable value.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the sale and having to settle with John for the same amount is not worth it.  I'm securing a guaranteed sale at my minimum desired price point."
