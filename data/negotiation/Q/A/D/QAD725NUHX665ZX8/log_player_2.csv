Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this valuable product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. This product is truly unique and offers significant benefits that are worth more than that.
