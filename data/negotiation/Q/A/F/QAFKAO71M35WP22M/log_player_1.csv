Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. While $950,000 is a decent offer, I think I can push for closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product.  I believe this is fair considering its potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $960000. This still allows room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is still a good deal and significantly higher than John's offer. It's important to balance the potential for a better deal with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
