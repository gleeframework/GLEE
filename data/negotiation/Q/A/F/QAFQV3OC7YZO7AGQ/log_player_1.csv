Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a product of exceptional value. Given its unique nature and your discerning taste, I believe you'll recognize its worth. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I have a strong safety net. This allows me to aim high with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) helps gauge Bob's eagerness and the product's perceived value to him.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial high price leaves space for potential negotiation.  If Bob counters, I can strategically reduce the price, still aiming for a figure well above $1,000,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit with Bob, understanding the risk that he might decline. If I were more risk-averse, I'd offer a price closer to $1,000,000 to ensure a sale."
