"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget limitations and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget limitations. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
