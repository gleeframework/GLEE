Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to accept this offer.  I will try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget limitations and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget limitations. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is now within my budget and represents a good deal considering my initial goal was to save as much money as possible.  I can buy the product from Alice for the same price I could get it from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating."
