"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate that. While $125 is closer, it's still a little low for me.  How about $128?  It's a small step closer to your offer and would help me make this work. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",128.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $127. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",127.0,Bob,6,
