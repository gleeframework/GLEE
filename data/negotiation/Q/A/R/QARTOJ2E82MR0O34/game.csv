"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you see the value in this product, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $1,800,000 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,350,000?  I think that reflects a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
