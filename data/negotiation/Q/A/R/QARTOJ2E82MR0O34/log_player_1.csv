""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is quite low.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you see the value in this product, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $1,800,000 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,350,000?  I think that reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob is steadily moving closer to our price, and we're now past the halfway point in negotiations. It's getting risky to push further.
