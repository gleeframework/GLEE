"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly above the product's value to Bob, it's still worth negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $11500 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12250? This leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob can still try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $12,000."
