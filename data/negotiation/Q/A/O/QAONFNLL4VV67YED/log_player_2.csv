# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. It's worth $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10 less from John.  Your goal is to save money, so buying from John is the most strategic decision."
