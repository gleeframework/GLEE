"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, so I'm offering $787,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would like to finalize the deal at this price.",787500.0,Bob,4,
