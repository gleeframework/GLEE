"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but still below my minimum. 
* **Setting the stage:**  I'm focusing on the value proposition for Bob and framing this as a unique opportunity.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing my minimum price.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to keep in mind that there's a chance Bob will immediately reject this offer. If he does, I'll need to adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I need.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a higher price.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can maximize my profits. 

**Next Steps:** I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our expectations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the price as fair.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm suggesting a possible closing of the deal to motivate Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy. Selling to John is still a viable option, and I might need to adjust my counteroffers to be more aggressive in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I need to make this deal worthwhile.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I want to keep the negotiation going, as there's still a chance I can reach a more favorable price.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the remaining gap and get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and also demonstrates my willingness to compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a significant concession from my previous offer, meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. It shows a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm still above my minimum of $1,000,000.  This creates some pressure on Bob to accept, knowing that selling to John is always an option.
* **Clear call to action:**  I'm directly asking for a response, giving Bob a clear choice to move forward or potentially lose the opportunity.

**Important Note:** I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as the remaining rounds are dwindling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price from Bob.
* **Close to minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and meets my minimum requirement. 

**Conclusion:**  While I'm not thrilled with the price, I'm choosing to accept the certainty of a sale to John rather than risk further negotiations with Bob.  The potential for a better deal with Bob is not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed profit."
