"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $1500000 on this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget and the value I seek, I would like to propose a price of $1600000 for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1600000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1600000, which would be $1700000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
