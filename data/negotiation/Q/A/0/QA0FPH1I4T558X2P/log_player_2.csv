"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.** This is still a bit higher than your ideal price.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is not ideal.** While John is willing to sell for $120, you can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility of a lower price, even if it means a few more negotiation rounds."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110.** This is still higher than your ideal price, but closer to your maximum budget.
* **You have room to negotiate further.**  While you're getting closer to your limit, a few more rounds of negotiation might help you save a bit more. 
* **Buying from John is still not ideal.** Although you can afford it,  negotiating with Alice gives you a chance to save more money. 

By rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations, you maintain the possibility of getting a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $115.** This is close to your maximum budget, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price.
* **Buying from John is the best option.**  John's price is $120, which is only $5 more than Alice's current offer.  Given the likelihood of further price reductions being small, it's not worth the risk of additional rounds of negotiation.
* **Negotiating further is unlikely to yield significant savings.** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but the gap between your desired price and Alice's offers is narrowing. 

Buying from John provides certainty and saves time without compromising too much on price."
