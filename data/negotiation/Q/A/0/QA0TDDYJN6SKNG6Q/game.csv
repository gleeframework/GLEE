"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value it brings to your business. Let's try to find a middle ground, I'm open to negotiating further.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a substantial profit for you. If we can't reach an agreement on this price, I might have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product. I'm feeling confident that this is a price we can both agree on.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,8,
