"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,800 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,150. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11150.0,Alice,5,
