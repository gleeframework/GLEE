Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price of $100."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}

While $85 is above my minimum, it's not ideal.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's very close to my minimum, I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a bit more before selling to John.  There are only a few rounds left."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the last few rounds, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get Bob to budge much further.  Selling to John for $80 is the best course of action at this point."
