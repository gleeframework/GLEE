"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value of this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better deal than John's price, it's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now.  Let's split the difference and agree on $10,750. I'm confident we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm looking for something closer to $10,900. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the Deal:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and Bob is getting closer to his ideal price point. 
* **Better than John:** While Bob could still try to negotiate further, $10,900 is a better deal than buying from John at $12,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If Bob continues to reject offers, Alice might walk away, or he might be stuck with John's higher price. 

By accepting this offer, Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
