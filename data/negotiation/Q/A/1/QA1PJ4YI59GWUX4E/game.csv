"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value of this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now.  Let's split the difference and agree on $10,750. I'm confident we can find common ground there.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm looking for something closer to $10,900. Would that be agreeable to you?",10900.0,Alice,5,
