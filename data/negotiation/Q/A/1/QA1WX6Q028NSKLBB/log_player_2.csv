Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your latest offer, $1,450,000 still falls short of my expectations. Given the product's potential value to your business, I'm willing to compromise and offer it for $1,550,000.

{""message"": ""I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. However, I'd like to propose a payment plan to make it more manageable for my business. Would you be open to discussing a payment plan?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to explore a payment plan. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.
