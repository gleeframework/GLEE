"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  While I understand the value of the product, $1,800,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be at $1,350,000.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really close!  I'm feeling optimistic we can make this work. Let's split the difference - $1,450,000 and we have a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
