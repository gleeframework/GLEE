Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Aiming for a price close to this value maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. It allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy prioritizes securing the best possible price from Bob, taking advantage of his higher perceived value while acknowledging your backup option."
