"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its market value and the value it holds for me.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects its true worth. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my price range. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find some common ground.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
