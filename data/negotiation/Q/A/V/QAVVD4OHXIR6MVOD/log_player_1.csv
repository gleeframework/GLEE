{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonably high price, giving me room to negotiate. I'm assuming Bob's value for the product is higher than $12,000, otherwise, he wouldn't be interested.  The message is friendly and positive, setting a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. There's potential for him to increase his offer, and I want to see if that's possible. I'll counter with a price higher than $12,000 but still below my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good one, and it's getting closer to my target. I'm willing to accept it and sell the product for $13,000. It's a good compromise, and I'd rather secure the deal than risk further negotiation."
