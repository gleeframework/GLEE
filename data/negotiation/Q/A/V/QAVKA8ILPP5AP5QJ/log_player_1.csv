Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a good middle ground. It's a significant step up from your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can still aim for a slightly better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
 
I'm sticking with a price that's above $85 but still leaving room for potential compromise. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing me to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer and is only $2 less than my minimum. Given the risk that further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away, I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
