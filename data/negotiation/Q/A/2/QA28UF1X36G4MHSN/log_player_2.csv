"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save money, and Alice is offering the product at the exact maximum you're willing to pay.  Rejecting her offer means you can still get the product from John for the same price.  This keeps your options open and doesn't commit you to paying anything at this point."
