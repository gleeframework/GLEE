"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90, as I mentioned in my previous message. Can you meet me at that price or lower?",90.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $105?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that price?",95.0,Bob,4,,
