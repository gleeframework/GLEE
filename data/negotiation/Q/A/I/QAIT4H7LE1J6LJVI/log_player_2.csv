"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $750,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal.  He's better off rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm aiming to stay under $700,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $680,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 680000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $680,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  He's able to save $75,000 compared to buying from John. While there might be room for further negotiation, accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids potentially drawn-out negotiations that could lead to a worse outcome."
