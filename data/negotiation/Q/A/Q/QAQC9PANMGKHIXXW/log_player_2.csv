This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Position:** You've negotiated Alice down significantly from her initial offer of $1,300,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Pressure:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, creating a sense of urgency. While she could continue negotiating, there's a risk she walks away.
* **Time Investment:** You've already invested time in this negotiation. John's price is fixed, so further haggling with Alice might not yield a significantly better outcome.

While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
