"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  He's better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you working with me.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's more beneficial to go with John's offer and avoid any further negotiations with Alice."
