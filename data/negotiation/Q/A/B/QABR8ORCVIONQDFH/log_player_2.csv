**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000, Alice is offering the product for $1,300,000. This saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's a good deal for Alice:**  Alice is getting more than her desired price of $1,200,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for Bob to save money."
