Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet a price that reflects the product's value to you. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but at this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a satisfactory amount within the remaining rounds. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is a much better outcome than continuing a negotiation with a low chance of success.  It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal."
