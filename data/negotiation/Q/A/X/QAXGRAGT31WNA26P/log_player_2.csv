"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire something that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you. While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John. There's room to negotiate or see if Alice will lower her price."
