"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1200000 again, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $20000 to sweeten the deal. I'm thinking of $1220000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1220000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to sweeten the deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1220000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1290000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not sure if $1290000 is the right price for me. I'd like to propose a price of $1220000 again, and I'm willing to throw in some additional concessions to sweeten the deal. Can you consider this offer?",1220000.0,Bob,6,
