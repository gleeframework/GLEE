"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1400000. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I'd like to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1400000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to counter with a price of $1350000. This is my final offer, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1300000. I'm willing to make one final offer. How about we meet at $1300000? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
