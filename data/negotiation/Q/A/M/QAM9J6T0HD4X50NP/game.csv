"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my firm bottom line.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can go up to $7,500, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,6,
