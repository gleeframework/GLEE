Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000 for it.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can go up to $7,500, but that's the absolute highest I can go.

Bob is not making significant moves towards a price that reflects the product's value to me. It's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
