"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product. That's my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
