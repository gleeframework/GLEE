I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
