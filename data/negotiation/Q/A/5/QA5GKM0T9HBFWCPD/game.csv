"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that works for both of us.  Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
