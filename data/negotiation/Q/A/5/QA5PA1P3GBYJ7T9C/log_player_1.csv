"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident Bob might be willing to pay a little more than $100, and I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. This counteroffer shows flexibility while staying within my acceptable range. I believe $160 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's initial offer and my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with more negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm making a final push with this counteroffer.  $155 is a significant compromise from my initial price and only $5 below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to push for a bit more, especially since I'm already close to the halfway point in the negotiations. I believe I can still get a better price without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price one last time to $145. This is a very small concession, but I believe it could be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. It's also just a bit above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm still getting a decent profit. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very tight, and I'm running out of time.  I've already made significant compromises, and Bob isn't willing to budge much further.  To avoid risking further rounds with the possibility of a lower price, I'm choosing to sell to John. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good outcome and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable sale."
