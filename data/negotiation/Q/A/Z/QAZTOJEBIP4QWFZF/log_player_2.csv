"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $900000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $900,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can do better. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $875000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.
