"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.  $1,500,000 is a significant amount, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm suggesting the deal is unique and time-sensitive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation and want to hear Bob's thoughts, which will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product, considering its potential value. This reflects a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a major loss for me.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  Bob's counteroffer shows that he's interested, but we need further negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Room for compromise:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for compromise. I'll use the next round to present a counteroffer that's more aligned with my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500,000 is simply too low for this product. I'm willing to compromise, however. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but emphasizing my willingness to compromise.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering $1,000,000, I'm proposing a midpoint between our previous offers. This shows a genuine attempt to find common ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and how it benefits both of us. 
* **Building Trust:** Showing flexibility and a desire to reach a deal can encourage Bob to take the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still out of my price range. Let's try $700000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the highest I can go at this point. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  There's still room for compromise.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to explore a higher price point in the next round.

**Reasoning:**

Although the $700,000 offer is tempting, it's crucial to stay true to my minimum value.  There's a good chance I can reach a price closer to $1,000,000 with further negotiation. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving money on the table."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your financial constraints. While $700,000 is closer, it's still not quite there.  Let's try $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.  Think of it as an opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that's within your reach."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Framing the Price:** I'm highlighting the discount from my initial offer and emphasizing the ""opportunity"" for Bob to secure a valuable asset at a reasonable price.
* **Building a Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting it's a comfortable margin for both of us, I subtly imply that this might be the best offer he'll get.

**Reasoning:**

With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to keep the negotiation moving. I believe $850,000 is a fair price that both parties can live with, while still being above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly value your flexibility in negotiations. However, $850000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is the maximum I can offer without exceeding my financial limits. I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. There are still a few rounds left, and there's a good chance I can push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to bridge the gap further in the next round.

**Reasoning:**

Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can likely secure a higher price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  Let's try $900,000. This is a fair compromise that accounts for the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident we can find a solution that satisfies both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridge the Gap:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that this offer is a fair compromise that allows for a win-win scenario.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating. 

**Reasoning:**
