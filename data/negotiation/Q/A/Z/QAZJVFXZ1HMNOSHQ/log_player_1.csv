Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle closer to your desired price.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) encourages Bob to decide quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation. You're not desperate, which puts you in a stronger position."
