# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above her own valuation, it's still $100,000 less than your maximum budget and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you money and ensures you acquire the product."
