Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,450,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up or accept your initial offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning that the product will be offered elsewhere creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
