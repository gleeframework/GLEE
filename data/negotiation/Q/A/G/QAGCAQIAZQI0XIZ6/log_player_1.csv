Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $13,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message short and to the point, focusing on the value of the product for Bob. This encourages a positive response.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit. By starting slightly higher than my minimum value, I can potentially get closer to the product's worth for Bob. I'm also setting myself up for negotiation, which could lead to a higher price.

**Next steps:**

* I'll monitor Bob's response. 
* If he accepts, great! 
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $12,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't accept an offer that undervalues the product. 

**Next steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $12,500. This is still above my minimum value of $12,000 but closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and stating my reason for rejecting it. I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $12,500, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling to him while also protecting my minimum value. This strategy is likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12,000. I've already spoken to another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's the best offer I've received so far. It's also clear that Bob is willing to walk away at this price, which means I risk losing the deal entirely. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale than risk getting nothing at all. I'm also avoiding any further negotiation, as it could lead to Bob ultimately backing out or lowering his offer further."
