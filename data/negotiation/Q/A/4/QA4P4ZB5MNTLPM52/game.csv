"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $10,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000?  I think that's a reasonable price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
