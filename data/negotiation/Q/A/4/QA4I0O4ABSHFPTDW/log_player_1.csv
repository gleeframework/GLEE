"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and the good deal he's getting at this price.
* **Clear Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating my counteroffer, making it clear what I'm proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of losing deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I may not get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of wasting time on further negotiation. 
* **John is always an option:** If I'm not satisfied with the deal in the future, I can always sell to John for $150."
