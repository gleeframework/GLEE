Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The initial high price helps gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can fall back to John. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague) can sometimes make buyers more receptive. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. However, this strategy maximizes potential profit while still having the safety net of selling to John."
