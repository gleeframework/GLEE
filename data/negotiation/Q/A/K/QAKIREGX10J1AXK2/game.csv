"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $11,500. This still gives you a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,500, which would be $11,000. Would you be open to considering that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
