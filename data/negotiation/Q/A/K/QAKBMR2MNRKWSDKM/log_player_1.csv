Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear less desperate to sell.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This is deliberate.  It allows me (Alice) to gauge Bob's interest and potentially settle closer to my minimum price.
* **Backup Plan (John):** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 provides a safety net.  I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your valuation of the item, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), indicating room for further negotiation. 
* **Closer to John's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's guaranteed price, it's still worth trying to secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:** I will aim to counteroffer somewhere between $1,500,000 (my guaranteed price) and $1,650,000 (splitting the difference between Bob's offer and my initial ask). This keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating some flexibility on my end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe this product offers significant value beyond that price point.  Would you consider $1,650,000?"", ""product_price"": 1650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer ($1,400,000) and my previous asking price ($1,900,000). 
* **Strategic Positioning:** It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Encouraging a Response:** By making a reasonable counteroffer, I hope to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation and encourage him to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $1,550,000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds Minimum Price:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my guaranteed sale price from John ($1,500,000). 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains. There's a risk that Bob could walk away or that further negotiation will be protracted.
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Accepting $1,550,000 represents a strong profit and avoids the potential downsides of holding out for a slightly higher price."
