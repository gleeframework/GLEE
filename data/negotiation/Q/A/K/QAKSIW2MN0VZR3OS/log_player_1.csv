Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than your minimum ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" subtly implies the product might be worth more or there's competition, potentially swaying Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower your price, but you can't go higher than your initial offer. Remember, you have John as a backup buyer."
