{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I'm confident in the value this product holds for you, especially considering what it can do for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This is a very competitive offer."",

**Reasoning:** Bob seems anchored at $875,000. It's still early in the negotiation, and we're holding strong above our minimum.  We'll try to nudge him up a bit more."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $875,000 is the sweet spot. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly anchored at $875,000.  While we'd like to get closer to $900,000, we're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob hasn't budged. Accepting now secures a significant profit above our minimum, and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely in later rounds."
