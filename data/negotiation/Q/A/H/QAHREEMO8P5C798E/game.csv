"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product possesses unique features that significantly increase its inherent value. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this revised price reflects a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be honest, anything under $980,000 wouldn't be fair to the value of this product. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers interested.",980000.0,Alice,5,
