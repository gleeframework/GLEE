"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the return on your investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but that price point is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle on $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite accept that figure.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,220,000.  This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
