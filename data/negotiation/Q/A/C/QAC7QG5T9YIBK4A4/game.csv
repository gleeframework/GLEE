"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better suit your needs. I am willing to consider a price of $825,000 for the product. This still maintains a premium over its intrinsic value to us, while providing a more reasonable offer for you. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I am proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. This aligns closely with the value you see in it and remains profitable for us. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",800000.0,Alice,5,
