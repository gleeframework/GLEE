{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to earn more, while also acknowledging that Bob values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I accept $16,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's a fair price, and we can finalize the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and is closer to my desired price than what I'd get from John.  It's a good deal, so I'm going to accept it."
