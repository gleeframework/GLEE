"Hey Alice, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I accept $16,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's a fair price, and we can finalize the deal right now.",15500.0,Bob,4,
