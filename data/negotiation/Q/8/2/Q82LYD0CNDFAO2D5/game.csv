"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this price reflects its worth and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for my comfort level. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional item. I'm counteroffering at $825000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This would allow us to both come to a reasonable agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell at $800000, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this point.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm on your price. I'm still hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  While $850000 is getting closer, I'm only able to offer $820000 at this time. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.",820000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $820000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm starting to feel that we're getting too far apart, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $840000. This is my last attempt to compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",840000.0,Alice,7,
