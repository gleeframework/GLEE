# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy. Bob can then purchase the product from John for $15,000, which is within his budget."
