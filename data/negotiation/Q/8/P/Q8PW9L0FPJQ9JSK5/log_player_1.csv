Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob than to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer."
