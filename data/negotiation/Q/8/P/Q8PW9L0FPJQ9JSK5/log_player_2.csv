"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $9,500. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price.  He's still $1,500 under his maximum price, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's getting the product for $1,000 less than his maximum price. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal or that Bob will end up paying more by going to John.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible option at this point."
