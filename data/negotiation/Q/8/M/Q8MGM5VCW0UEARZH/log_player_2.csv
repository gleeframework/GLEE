"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $15,000 for this product. Let's find a middle ground, how about $14,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go any lower than $14,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and it's still less than what John is offering. I hope you'll reconsider and we can reach an agreement.
