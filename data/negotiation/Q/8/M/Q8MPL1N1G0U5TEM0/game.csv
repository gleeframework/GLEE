"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree that the product is valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
