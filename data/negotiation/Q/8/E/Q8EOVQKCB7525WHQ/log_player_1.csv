{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price for what it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, slightly reduce the price, or stick to John's offer.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The high price will also serve as a gauge of Bob's interest. If he's completely turned off by the price, you know he's unlikely to meet your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $10,000, he doesn't know that you have another buyer.  Your offer should be justifiable, perhaps highlighting the product's unique features or long-term value.
* **Relationship:** If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly less aggressive starting price."
