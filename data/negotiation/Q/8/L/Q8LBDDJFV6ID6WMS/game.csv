"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can work something out.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15500.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options.",15500.0,Bob,4,
