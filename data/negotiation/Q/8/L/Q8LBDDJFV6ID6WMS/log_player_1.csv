Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $14,000 is too low for me. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15500.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $15,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $15,000.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
