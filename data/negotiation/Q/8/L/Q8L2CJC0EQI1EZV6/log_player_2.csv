Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $975,000? This product has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $725,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about $812,500? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $812,500, and she's stated it's her final offer. While getting the product for a slightly lower price from Alice would be ideal, the difference is now marginal.  John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, saving you time and potential negotiation fatigue."
