"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $975,000? This product has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $725,000? That's a significant move on my part.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $725,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $775,000? I'm eager to make this deal happen, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about $812,500? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,7,
