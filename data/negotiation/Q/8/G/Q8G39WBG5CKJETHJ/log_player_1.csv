Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  While $150 is your minimum, you know Bob values it at $100. Offering it at $125 gives a potential compromise where both of you gain some value.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150."
