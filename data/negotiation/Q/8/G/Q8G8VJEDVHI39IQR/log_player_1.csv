Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 200

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $150 for it if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still less than my minimum acceptable price. I know I can get $150 from John, which meets my needs. It's better to take the guaranteed sale than risk further negotiation with Bob."
