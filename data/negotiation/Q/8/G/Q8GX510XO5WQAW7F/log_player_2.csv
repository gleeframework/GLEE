"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($1,300,000) sets a clear expectation for negotiation.
* **Within Value Range:**  $1,100,000 is still within the range where Alice can make a profit (as the product is worth $1,200,000 to her). 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back with a price that's still favorable to Bob but also allows Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still above what Bob is aiming for. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:** Bob should try to avoid buying from John, as John's price is significantly higher than what Bob hopes to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is the midpoint between Bob's previous offer ($1,100,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,350,000). 
* **Close to Alice's Value:** $1,200,000 is very close to the product's worth to Alice. This is likely a price Alice would be willing to accept, as it still allows her to make a profit.
* **Strong Negotiation Position:**  By offering a price very close to what Alice is willing to accept, Bob strengthens his position in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Too High:** Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000.  
* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  At this point, it's unlikely that Bob can get Alice to budge much further. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and Bob is risking missing out on a deal with John if he doesn't act soon. 

By buying from John, Bob still gets the product for a price within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest he could have potentially gotten."
