"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $175? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $175. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $190. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $180, which is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $180. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $185. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $185 is still a bit too high for me.  If you're willing to go down to $180, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",180.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to walking away, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $180. I'm willing to meet you at $182, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",182.0,Alice,7,
