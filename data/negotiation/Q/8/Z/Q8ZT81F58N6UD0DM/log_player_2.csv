"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm looking to sell a high-end item that I think you might be interested in. Would you like to make me an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, accepting her offer makes sense.  You're not losing any money by doing so.  While you could try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge."
