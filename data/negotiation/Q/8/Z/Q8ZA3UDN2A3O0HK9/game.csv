,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we try $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to try and find a mutually agreeable price.  This leaves some room for negotiation, and would still be a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,850. That's a very fair offer considering we're both making a compromise.",9850.0,Bob,6,
