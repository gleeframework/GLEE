"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree the product is valuable, but $600,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do something closer to $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $400,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $520,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",520000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $520,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $450,000. Would that be possible?",450000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'll offer you a compromise at $500,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",500000.0,Alice,5,
