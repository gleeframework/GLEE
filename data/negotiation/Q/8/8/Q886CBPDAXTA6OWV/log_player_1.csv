Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $900,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to your alternative offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing the offer as time-sensitive, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk that Bob might reject the $900,000 offer. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
