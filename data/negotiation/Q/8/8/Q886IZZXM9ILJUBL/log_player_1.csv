Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes it's a ""great deal"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good price, even though it's above his perceived value. 

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice has a good chance of securing a sale above her minimum price while leaving a small margin for potential negotiation with Bob."
