"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $70, but that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $75?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",75.0,Alice,5,
