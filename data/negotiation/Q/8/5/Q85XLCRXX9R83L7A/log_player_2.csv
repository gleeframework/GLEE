"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product for cheaper, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You can still potentially get a better deal from Alice, and Jhon is still a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

Since Alice rejected your previous offer of $130, it makes sense to slightly increase your offer to $135. This shows that you are still interested in the product and willing to negotiate, but are firm on not going above your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget. You're willing to pay $150, and the current price is $145. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go lower and you'll end up in a stalemate.  Since you have the option to buy from John, it's better to secure the purchase now and avoid the risk of a failed negotiation."
