"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, I'm a bit constrained by budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my business needs. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  I'm offering you the product for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $12,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to my business. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",12250.0,Bob,4,
