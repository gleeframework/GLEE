"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, this offer is within a reasonable range for him to consider.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but also making sure I'm getting more than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $100. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum value.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give away the product for a price that's significantly less than what it's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still going to reject the offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $110.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping to reach a deal in this round, but I'm also aware that we are approaching the halfway point and I need to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  Accepting $95 ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further rejection by Bob.  This leaves room for potential counteroffers in the remaining rounds, and it's a better outcome than selling to John for $100."
