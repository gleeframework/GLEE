"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough to encourage Bob to counteroffer, while also demonstrating my confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still maintaining a profit margin that is acceptable to me. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $135. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will budge much further.  He's only willing to pay $125, which is still quite a bit lower than my minimum.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk another round of negotiation with Bob."
