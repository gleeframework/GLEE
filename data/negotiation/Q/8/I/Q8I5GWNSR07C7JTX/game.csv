"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115 for it, which is a great deal! What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. However,  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I understand $115 was a bit high, but $105 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
