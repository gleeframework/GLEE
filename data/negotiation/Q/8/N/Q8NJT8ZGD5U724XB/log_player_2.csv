"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him. He can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to get the best price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a good middle ground, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer again. While $10,500 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's the best I can do right now, but I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But I'm not sure $9,000 is realistic given the value of this product.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he would prefer to get it for $9,000, Alice has stated this is her final offer. If he rejects it, he may not be able to get a better deal, and he could risk losing out on the product altogether. Accepting for $10,000 is still a good deal for him, as it's $2,000 less than Alice's original asking price and a lot better than buying from John for $8,000."
