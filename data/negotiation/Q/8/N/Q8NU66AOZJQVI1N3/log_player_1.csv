Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to nudge Bob closer to a more reasonable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to come up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the most I'm willing to spend.

Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $1,000,000.  Since John offers $1,200,000, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the guaranteed higher profit."
