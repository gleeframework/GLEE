"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $150. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $75? That's a fair jump from my previous offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me at $75, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
