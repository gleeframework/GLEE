Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me at $75, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her valuation.  At this point, further haggling is unlikely to get the price down to an acceptable level. It's time to cut losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
