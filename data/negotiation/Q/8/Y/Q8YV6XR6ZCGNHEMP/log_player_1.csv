"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth $1,100,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for a high initial offer to maximize potential profit. Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we start significantly closer to his valuation than ours.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate downwards. Even if he counter-offers, it's likely to be higher than our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses confident language (""incredibly valuable,"" ""confident"") to subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counter-offer indicates he's willing to pay a significant amount for the product.  We have room to push for a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe the product's true value is significantly higher. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) than Bob did in the previous round ($200,000). This signals we're serious about a higher price while showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Our counter-offer is still considerably above Bob's, encouraging him to move closer to our desired range.
* **Seeking Compromise:** We explicitly mention finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product's value is higher, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** $950,000 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum by $150,000. It represents a successful negotiation outcome.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to push for a higher price might frustrate Bob and risk the deal. It's unlikely we'll gain significantly more in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner."
