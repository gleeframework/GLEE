"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I would be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
