"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the true value of the product. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
