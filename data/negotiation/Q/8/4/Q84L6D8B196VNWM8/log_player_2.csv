"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Alice's offer. $1,150,000 is still too high for me, and I want to see if I can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's still within my budget and better than buying from John."
