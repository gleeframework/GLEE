Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $6,000 is too low for me at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a higher offer. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I am too.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair deal. Let's settle this at $7,250 and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $7,250 is a good deal considering that:

1. I'm getting close to my desired price.
2. We are getting to the end of the negotiation rounds.
3. There's a risk of losing the deal completely if I reject the offer and Bob gets frustrated. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting nothing at all."
