"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a living from this sale. I can do $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $8,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to make this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
