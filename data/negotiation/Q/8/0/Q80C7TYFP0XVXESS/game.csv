"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name] for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. However, I'm confident in finding another buyer who values it at $1,500,000, so if this offer isn't appealing, I won't hesitate to move forward with them. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
