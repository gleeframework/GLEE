"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're right, $12,000 is closer to a fair price.  However, I can't let it go for less than $16,000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still pushing it for me.  What if we settle on $13,500?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated that $13,500 is his final offer. While this is closer to our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.  It's unlikely Bob will move considerably higher, and we risk losing a guaranteed sale by continuing the negotiation.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to sell the product to John."
