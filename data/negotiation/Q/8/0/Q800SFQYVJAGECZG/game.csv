"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, $12,000 is closer to a fair price.  However, I can't let it go for less than $16,000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still pushing it for me.  What if we settle on $13,500?  That's my final offer.",13500.0,Bob,6,
