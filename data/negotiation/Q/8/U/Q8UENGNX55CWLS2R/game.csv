"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. However, I value our discussion and believe this product can be a real asset to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer for today. Let me know if you're interested.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000.  That's already a significant discount from what I've been offered elsewhere. If you're serious about acquiring it, I need you to meet me at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
