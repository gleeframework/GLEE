"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  My absolute best is $11,000.  Let me know if you reconsider.",11000.0,Bob,6,,
