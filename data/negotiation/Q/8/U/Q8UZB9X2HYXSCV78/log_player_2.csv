"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's negotiate! Alice's offer is quite high considering her product's value is significantly lower.  We have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer that considers both our interests."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that's closer to Alice's valuation. This tactic might encourage her to negotiate within a more favorable range for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves a good margin for you. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is budging, which is good, but we're not at a ""good margin"" for me yet. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise that brings us closer to an agreement."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise that splits the difference between our previous offers. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also holds a firm position."
