"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. My asking price is $950,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product that will generate significant value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. You know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000, so you have leverage. By rejecting this offer, you can see if Alice will come down further."
