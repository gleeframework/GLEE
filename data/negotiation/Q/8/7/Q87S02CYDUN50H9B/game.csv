"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750.  How about $8,900?  That's a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,800? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8800.0,Bob,6,
