"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial value,  it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He has room to negotiate and should try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  I understand this is a bit lower than your initial price, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $950,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $1,025,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his budget. He has a few more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth rejecting and trying to get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000.  Would you consider $1,005,000?  This would be a great compromise for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product."", ""product_price"": 1005000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,005,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,050,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  With only 5 rounds remaining,  it's more advantageous for Bob to take the guaranteed price of $1,000,000 from John. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
