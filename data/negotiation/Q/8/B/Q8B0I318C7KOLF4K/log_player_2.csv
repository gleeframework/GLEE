"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still more than your maximum budget and more expensive than buying from John. You know you have a backup option at $800,000."
