"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is still above his maximum budget, so rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering the product to you at a price of $1,100,000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still save money by rejecting and attempting to negotiate further. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, Bob has a solid reference point for the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I have other options available."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're willing to consider it, but we're still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. We're willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product to you at a price of $1,075,000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, $1,075,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  With only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate might result in Alice becoming more stubborn, leading to a worse price. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price without any further risk."
