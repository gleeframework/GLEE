"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more,  how about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,800? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. ",11000.0,Alice,5,
