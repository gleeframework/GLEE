"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. While this is a good deal, you can likely do better.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a good profit for Alice (since it's $20 more than her value). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is willing to go down to $130, which is still a good deal, but I'm going to try to push for a lower price. $110 would be a good compromise, and I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can achieve that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Alice's latest offer of $130. This shows good faith in the negotiation and might be enough to get a deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is only willing to go down to $135, which is still higher than my ideal price.  However, at this point, we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's unlikely I'll be able to get a much better price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John for $150. Accepting Alice's offer means I get the product at a reasonable price, and I'm still saving $15 compared to buying from John."
