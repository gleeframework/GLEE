"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive negotiation.** 
* **Express continued interest in the product.**
* **Propose a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still potentially profitable for her.** 

This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but there's still room to maneuver. Accepting $82 would be a decent deal, but we can try to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counter-offer:

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise:**  Recognizing her willingness to negotiate keeps the tone positive.
* **Present a firm but fair counter:**  $75 is a significant jump from our last offer but still below Alice's cost.
* **Simple and direct language:**  Avoiding overly complex justifications can make the offer seem more reasonable.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to our target while remaining open to a potential final counter-offer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to let it go for that price. How about we try $79? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **We're close enough:** $79 is only $1 away from our desired price and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Further haggling is risky:** Pushing Alice further might make her less willing to negotiate or lead to an impasse. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing could mean more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better outcome. 

Sometimes a good deal is better than holding out for the absolute best-case scenario."
