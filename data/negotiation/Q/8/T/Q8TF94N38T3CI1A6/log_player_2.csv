"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know you've been interested in, at a price that I believe is fair and mutually beneficial. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Please consider this offer carefully.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is offering the product at its full value to her ($1,000,000), there's no advantage in accepting her offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open for potentially negotiating a lower price with her later or exploring other options."
