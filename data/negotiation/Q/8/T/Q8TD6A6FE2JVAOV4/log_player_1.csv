Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is just above Bob's perceived value ($120) but potentially appealing enough to make him think he's getting a good deal. 
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
