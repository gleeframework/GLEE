``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being squeezed too hard. 
* **Keeping the Option Open:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay more, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value with Bob first."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Time is a Factor:** With 10 rounds, I have time to see if I can find a price that works for both of us.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a bad deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $980,000.  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,015,000?  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1015000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 2 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision soon. 
* **John's Offer is Attractive:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would guarantee me a much better outcome.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $990,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm going to be upfront - I've received another offer for my product that's closer to my desired price. I'm willing to give you one last chance.
