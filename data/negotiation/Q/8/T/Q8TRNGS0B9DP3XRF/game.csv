"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not convinced $850000 is a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  That's a significant concession on my part, and it allows you to get a great deal on a product you really value.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $850000. I've already made a significant concession, and I think this is a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
