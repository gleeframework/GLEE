"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I'm looking to get a better price to ensure it aligns with my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for,  I still need to be a bit more budget-conscious. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the bottom of the price range I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,150,000 was my last offer, but I'll make a new offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,125,000 is a bit too low for me. I'll sell the product to you for $1,142,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to try to reach an agreement.",1142500.0,Alice,7,
