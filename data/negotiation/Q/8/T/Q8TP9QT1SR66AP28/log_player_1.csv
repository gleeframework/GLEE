Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit.  I'm confident I can negotiate a good deal, but I also have John as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $75, my goal is to maximize profit.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation, hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's more favorable to me. I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob will be likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still a profitable sale.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer."
