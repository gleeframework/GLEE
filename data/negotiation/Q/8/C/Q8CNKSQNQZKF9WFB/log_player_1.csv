"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to make Bob feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is a tempting offer, I'm going to reject it for now.  My goal is to maximize my profit, and I believe I can get closer to $80. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $75. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for this product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
