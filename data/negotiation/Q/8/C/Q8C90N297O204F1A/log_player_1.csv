Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrasing ""I'm proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" leaves room for negotiation while still conveying confidence in the product's value.

**Goal:**  This strategy aims to maximize potential profit by seeing if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
