Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm starting the offer at $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $125 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my initial asking price.  While I could potentially get a bit more by continuing to negotiate, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away or I'll run out of rounds."
