"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm confident you'll find the product is worth it!",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the price I'd pay for it from John. Can you accept that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
