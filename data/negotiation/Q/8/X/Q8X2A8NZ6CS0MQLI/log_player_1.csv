Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly unique."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" without explicitly stating what it is. This creates intrigue and allows Bob to justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a layer of desirability. People are often willing to pay a premium for something they perceive as rare or limited. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the offer price is key. By stating you are ""confident it's worth a significant investment,"" you subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine your next move. You might need to negotiate down, but starting high gives you leverage in the negotiation."
