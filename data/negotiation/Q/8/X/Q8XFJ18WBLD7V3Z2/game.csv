"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $125?  This is a fair price that's still within my range.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $110? That's a firm offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
