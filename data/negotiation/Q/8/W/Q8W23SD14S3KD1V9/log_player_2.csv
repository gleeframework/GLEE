It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  This will likely prompt Alice to negotiate further."

While $1,380,000 is closer to my target, I'm still confident we can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm serious about negotiating but still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit.  This should keep the conversation moving."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

We're getting closer to a good price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price below $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1340000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not going to go much higher.  The goal is to push her closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

We're getting close, but I'm not willing to settle for $1,360,000 yet.  I'll counteroffer one more time, hoping to get Alice down to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going back to my previous offer of $1,350,000.  It seems like a reasonable compromise, and it's within my budget.  This should either get Alice to accept or push her to make a final counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only one round remaining, it's time to accept Alice's offer. $1,365,000 is a good price, and it saves me $135,000 compared to buying from John. It's risky to reject and risk not getting a deal at all."
