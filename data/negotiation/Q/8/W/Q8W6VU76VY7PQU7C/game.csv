"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that can significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this exclusive offer to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that could be beneficial for both of us. I am willing to consider your offer of $8,500, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose we agree on a price of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
