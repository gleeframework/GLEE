Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to push for closer to my original asking price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $930,000 is a solid price and ensures I get a good return on the product."
