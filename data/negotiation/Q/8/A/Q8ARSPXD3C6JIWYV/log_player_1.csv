I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low for me. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still push for a higher offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. While I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $800,000? This would be a win-win scenario, as it's still within your budget and closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
