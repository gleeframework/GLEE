"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  Offering $1,050,000 is still more than 70% of Alice's initial asking price. This shows I'm serious about purchasing but want a price that reflects my budget. 
* **Waiting for Response:** Alice's reaction to this counteroffer will give me valuable information to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. Her argument about the product's value to me doesn't hold much weight in a negotiation. I'll try to push her a bit closer to my limit before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counter-offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down. To be honest, $1,150,000 would be the highest I could go.  It's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Alice met me halfway previously. Now I'm  countering closer to the midpoint between her last offer ($1,300,000) and my previous offer ($1,050,000). 
* **Firm but Fair:**  My message is polite but firm. I'm clearly stating my limit, which can encourage Alice to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Consideration:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'll strongly consider taking John's offer.  Each round brings me closer to potentially losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,250,000. It's clear she's holding firm on her ""final offer."" Since I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, it makes more sense to go with that option and save the $50,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point carries the risk of her sticking to her price, forcing me to either accept a worse deal or go back to John (who might not be available at that point)."
