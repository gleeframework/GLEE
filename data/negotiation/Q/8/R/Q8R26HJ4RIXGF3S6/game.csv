"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 130? It's a great deal for both of us!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $125? That way we can both get a good deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can do a bit better than 125. How about we try 127? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it for a great product like this!",127.0,Alice,5,
