{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you some room to negotiate. However, it's still reasonable enough that Bob might consider it.  This strategy allows you to test the waters and see how willing Bob is to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth. How about $950,000? I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,100,000?  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and the current market conditions, I propose a price of $1,050,000. This offers a fair compromise between the original asking price and the lower offer. I hope this suggestion is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is within my acceptable range and a significant improvement over his previous offer.  While I would have preferred my initial asking price, this is a good outcome that still allows me to get a decent price for the product."
