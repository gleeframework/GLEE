"Alice, $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. This product offers substantial returns, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer for this round.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
