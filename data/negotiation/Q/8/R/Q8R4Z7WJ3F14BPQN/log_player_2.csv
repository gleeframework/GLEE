Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to purchase from another seller."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,200, which is still slightly above my maximum. While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried that I might lose the opportunity to purchase from John.  Since I'm comfortable with John's offer, I'm going to choose to buy from him."
