,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you need to stay within your budget, but this product is truly exceptional.  Let's find a compromise.  How about $1,050,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still being a fair price for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $975,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a reasonable profit on this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,012,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of the product.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,012,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to reach a compromise. I'll offer $990,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $990,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to reach a figure that reflects the product's true value. How about $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, ensuring you get the product at a price that's within your budget while allowing me to achieve my desired outcome. Let's settle this and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to try to reach a compromise. I'll offer $980,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,
