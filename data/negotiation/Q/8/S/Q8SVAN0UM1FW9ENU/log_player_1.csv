"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're serious about selling but aren't desperate.  I'm aiming to get the highest price possible while still keeping the option to sell to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than my initial offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price. It also sends a signal that I am not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you need to stay within your budget, but this product is truly exceptional.  Let's find a compromise.  How about $1,050,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still being a fair price for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:** 

My counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. It's a compromise that is closer to his budget while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have a few rounds left, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option. By rejecting this offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $975,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a reasonable profit on this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,012,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  This shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my stance. It's a calculated risk, as I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I still believe there's room for Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,012,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to reach a compromise. I'll offer $990,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $990,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a guaranteed outcome.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $990,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to reach a figure that reflects the product's true value. How about $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, ensuring you get the product at a price that's within your budget while allowing me to achieve my desired outcome. Let's settle this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I've bumped the price up to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and the same as John's offer. I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final stand, and I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't accept.  This tactic could either push Bob to accept the offer or make him realize that we're unlikely to reach an agreement, prompting him to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to try to reach a compromise. I'll offer $980,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only two rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  John is a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000, and it's not worth risking losing that sure thing for a possible, but uncertain, outcome with Bob."
