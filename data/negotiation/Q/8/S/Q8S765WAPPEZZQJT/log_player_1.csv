Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than my floor, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would still give you a great deal and allow me to move closer to my desired outcome."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925000 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $875000. This would be a fair price for both of us.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I think I can get there in a few more rounds."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's try $900,000.  It's a good middle ground, and I think it reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, $887,500 is a good price and it seems like Bob is firm on his stance.  It's important to close the deal, and this offer is within a reasonable range of my goals."
