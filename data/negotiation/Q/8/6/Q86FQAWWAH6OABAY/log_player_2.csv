"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's perceived value, it's still above his limit. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a significant counteroffer.  $750,000 is a considerable discount from Alice's offer and still leaves some room for negotiation.  This aggressive counteroffer tests the waters and shows Alice that Bob is serious about securing a deal at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate aggressively, and there's a chance he can push Alice further down.  There's still room for improvement, and Bob can potentially get the product for a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his price limit, but still wants to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about a deal but still prioritizing his financial goals. The offer is also strategic, as it's a midpoint between Alice's last offer and John's offer, creating pressure on Alice to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his limit.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high.  John's offer is the best option at this point as it guarantees the product for Bob's maximum limit.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to get a lower price from Alice with the remaining time, and risking another round could lead to a situation where Alice rejects a counteroffer and Bob is forced to pay more."
