**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $1 better than John's price. There is no reason to accept it right away.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to potentially negotiate a better price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price.  There's no reason to accept it yet. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now the same as John's price, making it the best deal available.  There's no reason to keep negotiating as any further counteroffer risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at the lowest possible price."
