"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",990000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $990000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
