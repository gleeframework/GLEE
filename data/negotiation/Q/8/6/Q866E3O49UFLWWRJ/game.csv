"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've stated.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $975,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum price.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
