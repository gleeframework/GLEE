"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to both of us. I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation, suggesting $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a fair agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
