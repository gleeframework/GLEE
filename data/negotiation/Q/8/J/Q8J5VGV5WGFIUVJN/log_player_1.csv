Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still above my value for it but allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
