"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still above my value for it but allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair price considering we're both getting closer to a deal. Let's try to find common ground and reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
