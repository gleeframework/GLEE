"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Optimistic but Realistic:**  $18,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It also leaves room for Bob to find the offer attractive. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm aiming for a friendly and persuasive tone, hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's initial offer was low, he did acknowledge the value of the product. This suggests there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  With 10 rounds, I have time to work with Bob.  Rejecting his offer now allows me to counter and try to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  That would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm sticking to my minimum price of $15,000, showing that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Compromise:** By offering a compromise in the middle, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing that $15,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, which is positive.  This indicates there's potential for us to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time and Leverage:** I have 6 rounds left, and I can still sell to John for $15,000. This gives me leverage to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $14,500? That's a fair compromise, and it shows that we're both willing to work towards a deal. Let's close this deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm increasing my offer to $14,500, which is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. 
* **Emphasize Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing the compromise aspect, framing it as a good deal for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I'm trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to 4 rounds remaining. 
* **No Significant Progress:** Despite several counteroffers, we're still not close to a price that meets my minimum. Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price of $15,000. This is a safe and guaranteed outcome. 
* **Risk of Losing More:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob risks further lowering the price or ending up with no deal at all.  Selling to John eliminates this risk."
