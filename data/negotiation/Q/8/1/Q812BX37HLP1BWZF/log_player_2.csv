"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a significant amount of money, and it's very likely Alice is willing to negotiate lower. It's always worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to go lower.  It also gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured.  A $150,000 difference is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $350,000 is still a significant amount. It's worth pushing for a lower price. I'm confident I can get it for under $300,000 with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a better price.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $325,000, which is a good price considering the initial starting point. While I'd love to push for a lower price, I need to balance that with the risk of losing the deal altogether. If Alice keeps rejecting my offers, I might be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid that outcome."
