"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a win-win.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a good compromise, and we could both walk away satisfied. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
