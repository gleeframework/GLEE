"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still offers you a significant value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. Can you meet me at $875,000? I'm confident that's a price that will make this deal work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $950,000, especially since I know the product is worth more to him.  While $875,000 is a decent offer, I'm willing to hold out for a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $875,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about $890,000? It's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $890,000, which is $882,500. Can we make that work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to my desired price, I'm running out of rounds.  $882,500 is a good offer, and I'm confident that it's the best I can do at this point.  It's better than selling to John and much closer to the value the product has for Bob.  I'm going to accept the offer and close the deal."
