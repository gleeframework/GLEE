"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to highlight the potential benefit to him.
* **Open Ended:** I'm leaving the door open for discussion and counteroffers. 

I'm confident that this initial offer will start the negotiation process effectively while also securing a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Sell to John is Always an Option:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round with a price closer to $12,000 to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $12,000.
* **Maintain Margin:**  $11,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and gives me a better profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using language that emphasizes the benefits of the deal for Bob, encouraging him to accept. 

I believe this counteroffer will encourage Bob to reconsider while staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, and I would like to propose a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Acceptable:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $11,500. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We are already in round 4, and I have a limited number of rounds to reach a deal.
* **Potential for Future Negotiations:**  Even if I reject this offer, there is a chance that Bob might not increase his offer significantly in the next round. 

While I would prefer $11,500, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this stage to avoid potentially losing a deal altogether."
