"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. Since the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation.  

By rejecting, Bob opens the possibility of a lower price, potentially saving him a significant amount of money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value while still giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible.  Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price and potentially get closer to his goal of acquiring the product for less than $1 million."
