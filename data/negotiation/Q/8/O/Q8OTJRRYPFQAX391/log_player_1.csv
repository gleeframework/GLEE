Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price, but gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable price for him while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $120 that I'm willing to accept it. It's better than selling to John for $120 and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
