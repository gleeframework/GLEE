{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left and can potentially get closer to my desired price.  It's worth seeing if I can push Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can still get a better deal. I'm hoping to push him to a higher price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but $13,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $13,750.

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has come up to $13,500, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. With only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and with only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a sure deal."
