"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit of $2,000. I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so this price is significantly above his perceived value. However, it's also below the value I place on the product, leaving room for negotiation.  By starting high, I establish a starting point for negotiation and see if Bob is willing to budge.  

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the initial offer.  I'll adjust based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds.
* It's crucial to keep in mind the value to both parties, as well as the opportunity cost of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent profit, it's still below the value I place on the product.  I believe I can still do better. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to find a price that is acceptable to both parties, and leaves me with a profit that is more in line with my minimum value of $15,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  Bob offered $12,000, and I offered $17,000.  $14,000 is a fair midpoint, and hopefully, a price that Bob will find acceptable. 
* **Balancing profit and risk:** This price still gives me a profit of $1,000, which is less than my initial goal but still a decent return.  It's important to consider the remaining rounds. If I don't accept Bob's offer now, I risk losing the opportunity to sell to him and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price. 

**Strategy for the remaining rounds:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds based on how much he's willing to pay.
* **Consider the time factor:** The fewer rounds left, the more likely I am to accept a lower offer to avoid losing the deal entirely. 
* **Keep John in mind:** He's my backup option, and knowing he's willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a decent profit, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in negotiating with Bob.
* **Consider the alternative:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option, and it might be worth accepting in the future if Bob continues to be difficult. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll need to make a counteroffer that is more enticing for Bob.  It's likely he won't go higher than $12,000, but I'll aim for a price closer to $13,000.
* **Focus on the value:**  I'll remind Bob of the product's value to him and how a lower price could lead to a missed opportunity for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my offer to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer of $11,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit. 
* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the pressure to close the deal increases. Offering a price closer to his last offer might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Balancing value and profit:** This offer gives me a $1,000 profit, which is less than my ideal, but still a worthwhile gain.

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** If he accepts, it's a win! If he rejects, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy based on the remaining rounds.
* **Consider selling to John:** If Bob continues to be inflexible, I might need to consider selling to John for $15,000, as the risk of losing the deal entirely becomes higher. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** I'll need to be ready to negotiate further if Bob continues to offer lower prices, but I'll always try to maintain a profit margin close to my minimum value of $15,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a decent profit, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in negotiating with Bob.  
* **Consider the alternative:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option and might be worth accepting in the future if Bob continues to be difficult. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'll need to make a counteroffer that is more enticing for Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to $12,000.
* **Focus on the value:** I'll remind Bob of the product's value to him and how a lower price could lead to a missed opportunity for him."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Profit and Time:** With only three rounds remaining, the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing.  This offer is still above Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but also leaves me with a respectable $2,000 profit.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **Pressure and Opportunity:** This round represents a critical point. I need to be firm but flexible. If Bob rejects, I might need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round.

**Strategy for the next rounds:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate the situation, factoring in the remaining rounds and the value of selling to John.
* **Prepare to Sell to John:** If Bob's offer remains too low, I will likely sell to John in the next round to secure a guaranteed profit.
* **Emphasize the Value:** If Bob rejects again, I'll remind him of the value of the product to him and highlight the potential for a missed opportunity if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There are only two rounds remaining. Accepting Bob's offer would yield a profit of $5,000, which is considerably less than my ideal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With limited time, the risk of failing to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob is high.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significant profit, even though it's not my initial target.  

**Conclusion:**

Given the situation, selling to John is the most logical choice to secure a substantial profit and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
