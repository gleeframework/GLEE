Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it can bring great value to your business. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer. It's unlikely Bob will come close to $1,500,000 in subsequent rounds. Therefore, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and sell to John."
