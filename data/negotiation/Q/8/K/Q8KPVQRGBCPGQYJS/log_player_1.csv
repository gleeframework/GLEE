"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm going to start with a price that leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the product's value to me.  I'll be prepared to adjust if needed, but I want to see what Bob's reaction is first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, leaving room for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a price closer to my target. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good price and not losing Bob completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm going to counter with a price that's still above my minimum, but shows that I'm serious about negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that allows me to close the deal without losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, his offers are becoming increasingly unacceptable. I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
