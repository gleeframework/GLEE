Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would theoretically benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a fallback option with John, you have some leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Focus on Value:** Emphasize the ""return on investment"" to appeal to Bob's financial motivation. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Don't Reveal Your Hand:** Avoid telling Bob about your deal with John.  Your leverage comes from your confidence and the product's value."
