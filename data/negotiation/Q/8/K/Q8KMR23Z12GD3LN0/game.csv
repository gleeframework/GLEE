"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,900.

This is a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I've put into it.",8500.0,Alice,7,
