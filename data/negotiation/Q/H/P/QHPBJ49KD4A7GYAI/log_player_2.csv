You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially save $1,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

``` 
Alice's offer is good. You can get the product for $13,500, which is a better deal than buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely you won't get a lower price and you risk Alice walking away from the deal."
