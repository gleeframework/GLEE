Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a high price, but it's not unreasonable.  I'll gauge Bob's response to see if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think I can pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about $95?  That's still a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's worth my time.  I'm confident that $95 is a fair price, given the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $90 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's close to my initial asking price, and I'm happy with the outcome."
