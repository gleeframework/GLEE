```"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference -  $101.  That's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```
# Explanation: $101 is a reasonable price and within our budget. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal. Accepting at this point ensures we get the product at a good price.
