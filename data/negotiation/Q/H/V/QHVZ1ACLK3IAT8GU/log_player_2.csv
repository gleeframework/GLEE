"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can still save money.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really only looking to spend around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable accepting.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely secure a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  $9,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  However, I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's budget, and while they have been negotiating, it's unlikely that Alice will go any lower. Since Bob can purchase the product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sound decision to buy from John and save $1,500."
