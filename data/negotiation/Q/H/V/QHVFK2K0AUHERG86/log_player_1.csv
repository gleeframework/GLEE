Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I mention it's a good deal for both of us, emphasizing potential benefit. 
* **Flexibility:**  By leaving room for counteroffers, I show willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his actions. If he rejects, I'll likely lower the price slightly but not too much, aiming for a compromise. If he makes a counteroffer, I'll analyze it and decide if it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $80. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, but I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll need to balance being firm with being flexible to keep the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer of $100 is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $60 but still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Value proposition:** I re-emphasize the value proposition for Bob, mentioning that it's still a ""good deal"" for him. 
* **Flexibility:**  I use language like ""willing to be flexible"" to show I'm open to further negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I might lower the price slightly, but I'll be firm about not going below my minimum. If he accepts, I'll be happy to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a fair profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer:** Bob's final offer of $80 is at his perceived value, which means there is little room for further negotiation.  
* **Opportunity cost:** While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit that is significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price or a lengthy process that's not worth the potential gain. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll inform Bob that I'm accepting John's offer and thank him for his interest. It's a win-win situation, as I get the best possible price and John gets the product he wants."
