As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
