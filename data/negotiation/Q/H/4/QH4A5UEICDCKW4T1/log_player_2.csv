"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but $11,000 is still too close to that limit. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Time is on your side:** You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to reject the first offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Would you consider $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down in price, $10,250 is still more than you're willing to pay right now.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and Alice is clearly open to it. 
* **Rounds remaining:**  You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $9,875? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,875 is very close to your last offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $10,000 even? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:**  $10,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to your initial maximum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and this offer is a fair compromise. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or you might run out of rounds.

It's a good deal to accept, securing the product at a price that's beneficial for you."
