"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9,750? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this work!",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I still want to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,6,
