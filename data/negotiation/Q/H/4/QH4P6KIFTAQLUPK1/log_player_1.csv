"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly opening:** A positive message helps to build rapport and makes Bob feel more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $10,000, I can potentially negotiate down to a price that is still above my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I have a chance to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and can still fall back on selling to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my value.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open for discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage continued dialogue and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for higher counteroffer:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, so I can potentially push for a price closer to my target.
* **John is always an option:**  I can still sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9,750? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm inching closer to Bob's price point, but still maintaining a profit margin for myself.
* **Emphasize value and fairness:**  I remind Bob of the product's value and reiterate the fairness of the offer.
* **Positive and persuasive language:**  Using phrases like ""let's make this work"" encourages a sense of collaboration and increases the chances of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I still want to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $9,500 is still below my target of $12,000, but it's significantly closer than previous offers and within a reasonable range.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob's interest altogether. He's expressed frustration with the back-and-forth.
* **Time is limited:** We're already in round 6, and with 10 rounds total, I don't want to risk running out of time and being forced to sell to John for $12,000. 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation complications."
