{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're running out of time and Alice seems to be stubbornly holding out for a higher price.  While $593,750 is a decent price, it's still not ideal for us. With only one round left, it's not worth the risk of trying to negotiate further and potentially getting stuck with a worse deal. Buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees we get the product, even though it's more expensive.  It's better to have a known cost than to risk a last-minute failure in negotiations."
