Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than $160. I'm not too worried about losing the deal to John because the product is worth $150 to me and I can still make a profit selling it to him. I'll see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original price. Would you consider $170? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your offer, and I would like to counter with $165. This price is still within my budget and closer to what I'm comfortable spending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John. I've already made a good profit, and I'm happy with this outcome."
