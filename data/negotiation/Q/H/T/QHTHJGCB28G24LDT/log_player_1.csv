"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob ($900,000). This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for negotiation and secure a higher final price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to justify the asking price and potentially make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Note:** This is just the first round, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $750,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing us both to come to a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell it for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering with a price of $850,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob and emphasize that this price is still a fair deal, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. In response, I would like to suggest a price of $800,000 for the product. This price aligns closely with the value it holds for me, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's also possible that Bob might get frustrated and walk away from the deal.  Therefore, accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
