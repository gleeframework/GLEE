Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, as I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than $15,000, to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  While I would have loved to get my initial asking price of $20,000,  Bob's offer of $16,000 is still above my minimum and a good profit for me. It's better than going back and forth with more counteroffers, and I'd rather secure the sale now."
