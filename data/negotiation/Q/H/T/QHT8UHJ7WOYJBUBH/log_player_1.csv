Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $150, we see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he declines, we can adjust and still fall back on John's offer. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value without explicitly stating it, which can be more persuasive than just stating Bob's perceived value."
