"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob could end up paying more than he wants or potentially lose the deal altogether.  Buying the product from John at $10,000 guarantees a purchase at his desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
