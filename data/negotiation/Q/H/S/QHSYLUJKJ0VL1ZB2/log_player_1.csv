"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can likely negotiate a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a great price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering the price to $115, which is still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and expressing my willingness to negotiate to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107 is close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. There are still 6 rounds left, giving me ample time to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but staying above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and expressing my desire to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'd be willing to pay $108 to seal the deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though $108 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can squeeze a little more out of the deal. There are only 4 rounds left, but I'm determined to see if we can reach a compromise at a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle at $109. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this sale."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $109, just slightly above Bob's last offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and highlights the benefit of closing the deal.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
