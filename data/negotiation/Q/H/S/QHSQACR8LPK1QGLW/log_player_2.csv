Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm firm at $8,000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm at $8000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this product. Is this a price you're willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to my budget. However, it's still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Since I have a reliable alternative with John at $8,000, I'm going to go ahead and buy from him to avoid further negotiation."
