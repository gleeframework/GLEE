"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $160 is still a little out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's my final offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $150 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $150, which would be $155. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
