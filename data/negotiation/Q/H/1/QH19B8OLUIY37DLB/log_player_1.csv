""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is considerably below its true value. This product offers you a significant competitive advantage, and I'm confident you'll recoup your investment quickly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but I have a budget in mind.  I can go up to $750,000. This is a fair offer considering we're still early in negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving in the right direction, $750,000 is still significantly less than our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate and time is on our side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However,  $750,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To be fair to both of us,  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $787,500? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we're only $12,500 away from John's offer. It's worth risking another round to see if we can get Bob closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's wrap this up - I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our absolute minimum. We're now at a point where we match John's offer. Making our position firm and presenting this as our final offer may encourage Bob to close the deal."
