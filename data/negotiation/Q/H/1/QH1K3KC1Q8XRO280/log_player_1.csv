Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Confidence and Value:** The message highlights the product's value and positions it as a unique opportunity, justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at the highest possible price, while acknowledging the risk that he might reject the offer."
