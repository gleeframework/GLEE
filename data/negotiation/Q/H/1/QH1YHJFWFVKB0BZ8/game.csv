"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth discussing a price of $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1800000.0,Alice,1,,

"While I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value to me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1,700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value to you."
"I'm glad we're making progress, but $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, which is a fair price for me considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,,
