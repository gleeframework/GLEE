"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and a counteroffer could potentially get the price closer to Alice's minimum of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. Offering $13,000 is a significant step down from Alice's $14,000 offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum of $12,000. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price.  It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is closer to Bob's maximum price than John's offer, but still higher than Bob's preferred price.  Since there's room for negotiation, rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $13,000 and Alice's latest offer of $14,500. Offering $13,500 shows that Bob is still willing to negotiate, but also that he's not willing to go much higher than his previous offer. This counteroffer could potentially be accepted by Alice, especially if she's willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is exactly the same price as John's offer.  Bob's goal is to save money, and there is no advantage to continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point.  Buying from John for $15,000 is the best option since it avoids further rounds of negotiation and guarantees the purchase of the product within Bob's budget."
