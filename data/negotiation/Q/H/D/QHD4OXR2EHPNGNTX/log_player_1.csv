Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $130. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer below that is unacceptable.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting high allows you to potentially capture more of the value Bob places on the product.  A price of $130 leaves room for negotiation while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup allows you to be more confident in setting a higher initial price for Bob."
