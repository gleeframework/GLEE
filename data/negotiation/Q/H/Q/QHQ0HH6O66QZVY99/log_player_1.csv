"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's a fair price and I'm confident I won't be able to get a much higher price in the remaining rounds."
