{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still quite high.  It's worth seeing if Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. We appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. In light of your offer, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the effort put into its creation. We hope this proposal better aligns with your budget while still allowing us to fairly compensate for our investment and expertise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still a significant amount.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. The goal is to get as close to his ideal price of $850,000 as possible before resorting to buying from John."

I believe a price of $875,000 would be fair to both of us, considering the value we both see in this product. This price strikes a balance between my budget and the value of your offering. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. After careful consideration, we have decided to counter your offer with a price of $890000. We believe this price reflects the unique qualities and value of our product while remaining within your budget constraints. We hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal price:** $890,000 is only $25,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.
* **Saving money is the priority:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $110,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** It's unlikely that Alice will drop much further, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate will make her less willing to sell.

While Bob might ideally get the product for $875,000, it's strategically better to accept this offer and secure a good price. The risk of negotiating further is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price."
