"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it!

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a better price, but I have to make a living, you know! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $850000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not ready to accept.  I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product within my budget. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $810000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $810,000, which is a good price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a chance she might walk away, and I'd end up paying John $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves me $190,000."
