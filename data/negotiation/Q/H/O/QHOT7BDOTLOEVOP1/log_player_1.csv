{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this unique product which I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on it."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and the potential to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below the minimum value I've set for the product. I have six rounds left, which is enough to see if I can get a higher offer from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're still working within a budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident this product will be well worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a good one, it's still below my minimum desired value. I have four rounds left, and I'm confident that I can get a higher price. I don't want to settle for less than my product is worth. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To show my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher than $1,200,000. I only have two rounds left, and I'm at risk of getting stuck with a price below my minimum acceptable value.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John and secure at least $1,000,000 for the product."
