Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You need to make at least $150 from the sale.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting high allows you to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters. While $170 is more than Bob values the product for, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more than $80 if he really wants it.
* **Backup plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed to sell it to John for $150, so there's no risk of losing money.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping your guaranteed sale to John in mind."
