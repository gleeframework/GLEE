"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,250,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That's a fair deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we compromise at $1,200,000?  This is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
