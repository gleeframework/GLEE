"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This still gives me a decent return while making sure the product goes to someone who values it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $135? This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
