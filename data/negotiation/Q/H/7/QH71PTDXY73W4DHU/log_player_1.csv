"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still lower than what John is willing to pay. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This still gives me a decent return while making sure the product goes to someone who values it."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired target.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $135? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $130, so I'll try to meet you at $132. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Bob's offer of $132 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and is a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a sale before I run out of time."
