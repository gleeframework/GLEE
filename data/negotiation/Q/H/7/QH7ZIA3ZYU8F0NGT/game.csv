"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, considering your minimum acceptable price and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
