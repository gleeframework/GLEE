{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  That's a substantial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both my minimum and the product's actual worth to him ($1,000,000).  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a respectable offer, it doesn't reflect the full value of what this product can do for you. To move this forward, I could accept $825,000.  This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm applying a bit of pressure by mentioning other buyers and stating this is my final offer. This might encourage Bob to make a more substantial jump in his next counter, hopefully getting closer to the $800,000 mark I need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $787,500.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's clear that he's aiming for a price well below my minimum. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on potential profit. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price."
