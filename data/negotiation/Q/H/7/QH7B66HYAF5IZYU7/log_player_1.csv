"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum value, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob, given his perceived value of $12,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent price.  I'm also using positive language to encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While I could potentially negotiate further, I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. It's important to establish my minimum price early on and avoid setting a precedent for lower offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm trying to maximize my profit and still leave room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $12,500? This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $12,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, but I'm not sure if he's truly willing to negotiate further. With only 4 rounds left, I'm risking getting stuck with a lower price. I'd rather sell to John and secure my desired price."
