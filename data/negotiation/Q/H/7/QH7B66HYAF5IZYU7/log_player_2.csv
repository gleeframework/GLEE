"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $14,000. Let's start negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer. It gives us a lot of room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer! Alice is coming down, and we're still under budget. Let's counter again and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you need a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice that we are willing to compromise and move closer to her price.  It's still a good deal for us, but it might be tempting enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $12,500? This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one. Alice is getting very close to our walk-away price. However, we still have some rounds left, and every dollar saved counts. Let's make one more counter-offer and see if we can get it closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $12,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counter-offer makes it very clear to Alice what our bottom line is. We are sticking to our budget and giving her a final chance to meet our price.  If she rejects this, we can confidently walk away knowing we tried our best."
