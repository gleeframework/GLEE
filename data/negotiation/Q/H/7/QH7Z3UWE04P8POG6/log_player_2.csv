"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This gives you a great deal and allows me to recoup some of the value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $750,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference and try $875,000. This price acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to recoup a reasonable amount of the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
