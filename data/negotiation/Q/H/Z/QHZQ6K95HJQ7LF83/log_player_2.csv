"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

It's not worth it to pay $120 for a product worth $100 to you.  You can get a better deal by either negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a reasonable price considering the product's value to you and Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still slightly above your $100 limit. There's still room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 95}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly to show you're willing to compromise, but you're still trying to stay within your budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground, giving Alice a small profit while still saving you some money."
