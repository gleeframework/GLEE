You have three options:

You can do better than $100. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:

$92.5 is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95. It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

While $95 is closer to your upper limit of $120, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  You're also getting a good price for a product you value at $120."
