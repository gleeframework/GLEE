"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is trying to save as much money as possible, and $9,000 is still more than his maximum budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. He could also potentially reach out to John, reminding him that he's willing to pay $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to his price, it's still above his budget.  He can't risk going further with Alice, as there's no guarantee she'll come down to his price.  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is within Bob's budget."
