I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this will gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,400,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is not a bad price, I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,450,000. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but still within a reasonable range for both of us.  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob still wants to haggle, but also allows me to secure a good price without risking losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but we're not quite there yet.  Since we've gone back and forth several times, it's time to cut my losses and accept the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's better to have a certain profit than to risk losing the deal entirely with Bob."
