This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures you're getting a good price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's right in my price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
