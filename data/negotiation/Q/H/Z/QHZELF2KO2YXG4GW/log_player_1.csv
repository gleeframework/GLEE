Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 is a good starting point. It's below your minimum but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes ""special price"" and ""great deal"" to entice Bob and frame the offer positively.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, you might need to adjust your strategy in further rounds of negotiation."
