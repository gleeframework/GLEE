"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to move on to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one more attempt at a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there.",8500.0,Bob,6,
