Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $9,500 leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point given the product's value to me.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While I could start higher, I don't want to scare Bob away immediately. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can encourage Bob to engage. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  While I could sell to John for $10,000 right now, I think I can potentially get closer to my asking price with another counter-offer to Bob.  He clearly wants the product, so there's room for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I will send a counter-offer to Bob, aiming to find a price somewhere between $8,500 and my initial $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $9,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  I keep the message friendly and emphasize finding a fair price that works for both of us. 
* **Opportunity for Agreement:**  I believe $9,000 is still a good price for me, while being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a favorable price. 
* **Potential for More Negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counter-offer, or sell to John."
