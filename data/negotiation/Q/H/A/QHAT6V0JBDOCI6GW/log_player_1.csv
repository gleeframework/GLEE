"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $145 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm also being friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me, though.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is too far below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it shows I'm serious about making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 125}
