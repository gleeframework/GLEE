Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $87 as my counteroffer.

You have three options:

While I could try to push for a bit more, $87 is a decent profit over John's $80 offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale."
