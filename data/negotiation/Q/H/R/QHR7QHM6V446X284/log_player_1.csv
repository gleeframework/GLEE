"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also potentially secures a good price early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $13,500.  This shows flexibility and is a good compromise point, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
