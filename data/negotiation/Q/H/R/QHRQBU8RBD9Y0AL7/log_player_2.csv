"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great:**  You can save $500 by accepting, but there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffers can be beneficial:** By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to walk away, giving you leverage to potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  If negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Alice with a price lower than $11,500 but higher than $10,000, aiming to find a compromise."
