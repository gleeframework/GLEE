"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm sure you'll find incredibly useful.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant price reduction from what I could get elsewhere, but I believe in the potential of this product for you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a reduction from her asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is within Bob's budget and saves him $100,000."
