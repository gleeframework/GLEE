"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, and I'm offering it to you first at $180.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($180) to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Positive Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Emphasis:** I highlight the ""amazing"" nature of the product to imply its value.
* **First Offer:** I'm taking the initiative and making the first offer to establish a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum selling price is $120, and Bob's offer is right at that minimum.  
* **Potential for More:** There's still room for negotiation. While $120 is my floor, I can potentially get more by rejecting and making a counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and might be willing to walk away. This can put pressure on him to come up in his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $150? It's a fair compromise and still gives you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Approach:** I'm going for a price that's in the middle of my initial offer ($180) and Bob's offer ($120).  
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it seem like a reasonable solution.
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  The message remains positive and encouraging to keep Bob engaged. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** This counteroffer leaves room for a potential agreement while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a little high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $120.  I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is firmly standing at his $120 offer, and I've already lowered my price from $180 to $150. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are now in Round 4, meaning I have only 6 rounds left.  I don't want to risk further negotiation stalling the deal.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $120.  

While I'd prefer to get more,  selling to John ensures I don't lose out on a guaranteed profit and still achieve my minimum goal."
