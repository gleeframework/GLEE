"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
