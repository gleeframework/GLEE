"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly below her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $10,000, which aligns perfectly with your budget."
