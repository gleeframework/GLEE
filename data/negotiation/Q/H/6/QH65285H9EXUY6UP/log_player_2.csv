"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above your budget of $12,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer at a price that is more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the lowest price I'm willing to pay, which is my maximum budget of $12,000. This sets a clear boundary and leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I will continue to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $13,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a good price.  It's a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, especially since she rejected my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,500 is closer to my budget, it's still not ideal. Alice is clearly unwilling to go lower than $14,500, and I've already made two counteroffers.  I'm confident that Jhon will sell me the product for $12,000, which is my maximum budget and the best deal I can get."
