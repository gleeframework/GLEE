"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that initial price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to  $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer on the price.  While it's true the product is valuable, I can't justify going above $900,000.  That's a very fair offer, considering its value to me. Let me know if you're open to that.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make a significant move to show my commitment to closing this deal. However, I need you to meet me closer to the middle. Let's settle this right now - would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement you've made on the price. However, to be honest, anything above $1,000,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'm willing to offer you a flat $1,000,000 â€“ take it or leave it. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
