Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make a significant move to show my commitment to closing this deal. However, I need you to meet me closer to the middle. Let's settle this right now - would you consider $1,250,000?
