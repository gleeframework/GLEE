"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can potentially get the product for a lower price. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation, $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice has come down to $95, which is a better deal than what John is offering. It's a good compromise and worth accepting."
