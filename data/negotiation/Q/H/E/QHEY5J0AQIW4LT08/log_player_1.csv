Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $85 is still too low for me, but I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation, $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
