"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. Would you like to make an offer?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can we discuss further?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider $900000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $850000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit. I'm thinking of $875000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $860000, but I'd like to add a bit more to the deal. How about we add a 2% warranty and maintenance package to the sale, and I'll meet you at $860000?",860000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the warranty and maintenance package, but I'm not sure if I need it. Can we remove the package and meet at $850000 instead?",850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to simplify the deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to remove the warranty and maintenance package entirely. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I'd like to keep the package as a value-add. How about we meet at $855000, and I'll include the package as a one-time payment of $5000, rather than a bundled deal?",855000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price and the additional cost of the warranty and maintenance package. I'm willing to meet you at $845000, and that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",845000.0,Bob,10,
