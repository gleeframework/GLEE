"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value to your business. This product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a significant price point that reflects the value of this product. I'm confident that this is a deal you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above what the product is worth to her. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price reflects the significant value this product holds, while still being within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's work together to reach a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  $1,075,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the risk:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a higher price from Alice.
* **Time and opportunity cost:**  Prolonging negotiations could take valuable time that Bob could be spending on other opportunities.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product for a price that's significantly lower than buying from John, while minimizing the risk of a stalled negotiation or a worse outcome."
