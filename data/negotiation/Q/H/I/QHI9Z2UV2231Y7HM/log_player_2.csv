"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above my maximum budget.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  I have room to negotiate a lower price and save money. 
* **There's no immediate urgency.** I can afford to go through a few rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the potential benefits it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has lowered the price, it's still above my ideal price point and I believe I can get a better deal.
* **I'm confident in my negotiation position.** I have time and flexibility to continue negotiating and make further counteroffers.
* **John's offer is still a backup option.** If I can't get a better price from Alice, I can still purchase from John, although it's not my preferred option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty on the product, which is a $50,000 value. So, I'm effectively offering you a deal worth $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The price is now within my budget:** Alice has come down to my counteroffer of $975,000, which is within my desired price range.
* **The additional value is a bonus:** The 5-year warranty is a significant add-on, effectively making the deal worth $1,025,000, exceeding my original maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:** Alice has indicated she won't go lower, and I'm not comfortable pushing further. 
* **John's offer is less attractive:**  While I can still buy from John, Alice's offer with the warranty is a better deal overall."
