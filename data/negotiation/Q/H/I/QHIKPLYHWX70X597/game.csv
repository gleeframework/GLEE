"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
