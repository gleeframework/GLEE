"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this work.  This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's keep talking and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and your willingness to compromise. I hope you'll find this acceptable.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress.  However, $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to offer $910,000. This is a fair compromise considering both of our positions.  Let's see if we can close this deal now.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close, but $910,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $915,000 as a final compromise.  This reflects both the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win.",915000.0,Alice,7,
