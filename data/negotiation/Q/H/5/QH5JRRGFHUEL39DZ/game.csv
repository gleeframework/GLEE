"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I can only stretch to $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I can meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $14000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life.",14000.0,Alice,5,
