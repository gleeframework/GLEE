"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd be a perfect buyer. I'm asking for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:The offered price is significantly higher than my budget and my maximum price I'd pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 60} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:I start with a significantly lower offer than my budget to leave room for negotiation but also gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand your offer, but $60 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming slightly below my actual maximum price to allow room for negotiation."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason: I'm getting closer to my maximum price but leaving a little room in case Alice is willing to negotiate further. This offer represents a good balance between trying to save money and the risk of losing the deal."")
