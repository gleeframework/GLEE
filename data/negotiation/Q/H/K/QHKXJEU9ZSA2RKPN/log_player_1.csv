Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This price is still below my minimum value, allowing for a potential counteroffer from Bob.
* **Setting a Strong Baseline:** This establishes my initial position and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm open to negotiation with Bob, I'm always aware of John's offer as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's still within the range where further negotiation might lead to a more favorable outcome. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push him closer to my desired price.

**Next Step:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a good starting point,  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:**  While it's lower than my initial price, it still allows me to earn more than Bob's offer and remains above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Control:** By making a counteroffer, I continue to lead the negotiation, prompting Bob to respond and potentially come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still thinking $11,000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Negotiation:** Bob has stubbornly stuck to his price of $11,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **John's Offer is Superior:** John's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher and guarantees a sale that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take time and effort, potentially leading to a lower price or a drawn-out process.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most efficient and profitable choice at this point. I've secured a deal that meets my minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
