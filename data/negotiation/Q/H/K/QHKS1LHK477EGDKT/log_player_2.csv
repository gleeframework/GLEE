# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still above your self-imposed limit of $1,000,000. You can try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I recognize its potential value,  $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still within your budget limit of $1,000,000. This is a good deal, and there is no guarantee that you'll be able to negotiate a lower price. It's a good idea to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
