"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and John is offering it for $150, it's the most rational choice to buy from John. There's no need to negotiate with Alice, as there's no potential for saving money."
