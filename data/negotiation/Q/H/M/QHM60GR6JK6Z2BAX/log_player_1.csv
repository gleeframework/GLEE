Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $10,000, showing that you are serious about maximizing your profit.  At the same time, it leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000.  

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of him accepting, while still securing a good deal for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is a decent amount, it's still lower than the $14,000 offer. It's worth trying to push for a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise that shows flexibility while still trying to get a better price than Bob's offer.  It's a smaller step than my previous offer, indicating a willingness to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering $12,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer of $14,000 and still a bit below my desired profit margin.  I've already rejected his previous offer, and further negotiation may not yield a better outcome. 

Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a secure sale and meets my minimum requirement. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best choice to avoid potentially losing more value in further negotiations."
