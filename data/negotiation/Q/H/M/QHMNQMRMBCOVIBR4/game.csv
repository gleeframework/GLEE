"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $79 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",79.0,Alice,5,
