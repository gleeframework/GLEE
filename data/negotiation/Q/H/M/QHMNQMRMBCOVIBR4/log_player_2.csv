Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $79 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and at this point, accepting the $79 offer is better than paying John $80."
