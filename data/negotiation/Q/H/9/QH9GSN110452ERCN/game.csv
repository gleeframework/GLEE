"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not comfortable going above that amount. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $925,000. Can you consider this compromise?",925000.0,Bob,4,
