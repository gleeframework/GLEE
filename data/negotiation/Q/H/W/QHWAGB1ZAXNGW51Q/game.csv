"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $70 for it right now. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $100. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $75. How does that sound?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I can offer it to you for $95, which is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $95 is a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll love it.",90.0,Alice,7,
