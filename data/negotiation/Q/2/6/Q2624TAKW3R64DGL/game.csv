"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
