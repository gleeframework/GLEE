"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $750,000 difference allows for multiple rounds of negotiation before potentially resorting to selling to John.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly and open tone can encourage Bob to engage in a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth less than $1750000 to me. I would like to propose a price of $1400000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to sell for less than $1,500,000. 
* **More negotiation is possible.**  There's still room for compromise, and I can use the remaining rounds to try and get a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If negotiations continue to stall, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By staying above $1,500,000, I maintain some leverage in case Bob continues to reject my offers.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1550000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's offer suggests he might not budge much further. 
* **Risk of losing a good deal:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, or I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I can still sell to John for my minimum price, so accepting this offer is a good compromise."
