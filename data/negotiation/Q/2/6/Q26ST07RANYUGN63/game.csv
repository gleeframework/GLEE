,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $100. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway",92.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price.  $92 is still a bit lower than I can go. Let's try $95. It's a compromise that's closer to where I need to be.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the persistence, but I'm still a bit above $94. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go much higher",92.0,Bob,8,
