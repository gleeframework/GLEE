"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
