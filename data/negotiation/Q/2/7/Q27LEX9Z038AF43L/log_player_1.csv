"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm confident John will buy it for $120 if this doesn't work out, so I'm not afraid to push for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of him. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and agree to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's a good compromise and gets me closer to my minimum price. It's also a safer bet than trying to push for a higher price and risking losing the deal completely.  There's always the chance Bob will reject my next counteroffer and I might not get a chance to close the deal at all."
