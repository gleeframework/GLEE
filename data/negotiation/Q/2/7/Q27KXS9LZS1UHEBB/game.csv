"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significantly higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about $700,000? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that $700,000 is a significant jump, and I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $1,000,000 flat? This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
