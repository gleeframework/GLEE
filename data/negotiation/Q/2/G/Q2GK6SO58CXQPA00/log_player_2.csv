"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  Based on its potential in your business, I believe it's worth at least $1,500,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant discount, and it's a price I'm confident we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to inflate the perceived value, the offer of $1,400,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
