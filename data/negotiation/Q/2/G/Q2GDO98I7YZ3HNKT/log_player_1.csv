Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm going to start with my minimum price of $100. I know that selling to John guarantees me that amount, so there's no reason to settle for less right away.  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. It's a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer, and I hope it will encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $85, which is closer to my target price of $100.  While I'd still prefer to get more, I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by holding out for a higher price."
