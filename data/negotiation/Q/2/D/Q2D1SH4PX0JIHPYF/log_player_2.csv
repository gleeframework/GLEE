Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is far above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,600,000 is still above his maximum budget. He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so there is no reason to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob should counteroffer at $1,200,000. It's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, and it might tempt her to negotiate further.  It's also a price that Bob is comfortable with as it is closer to his budget limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,500,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still too high.  Bob can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. It makes more sense to continue negotiating with Alice or buy the product from John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Bob should counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's willing to move closer to her price but still firmly within his budget. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above his budget and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

Bob should counteroffer at $1,350,000. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's willing to move closer to her price, but still firmly within his budget.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects again.  If Alice rejects, he can always go to John and get the product for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the price has come down, it's still above his target budget and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  The best strategy at this point is to keep trying to negotiate with Alice, or go to John and buy the product for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1360000}
```

Bob should counteroffer at $1,360,000. This is a small increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's willing to compromise.  He's still within his budget and it leaves room for a few more rounds of negotiation if needed. If Alice rejects, he can always go to John and buy the product for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is clearly unwilling to go lower than $1,370,000 which is still higher than Bob's budget.  John's price of $1,000,000 is the most advantageous option, and Bob can save $370,000 by buying from John."
