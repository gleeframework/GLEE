"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's below my minimum price of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a clear incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than my desired outcome. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $118. This is a good deal for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 118} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $118 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiations are getting close to my minimum price, but it's not clear if Bob is willing to go any higher.  John's offer of $150 is significantly more profitable and guarantees I reach my minimum desired price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
