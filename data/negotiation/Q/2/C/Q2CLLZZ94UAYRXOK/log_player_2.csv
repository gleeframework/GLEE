Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,250? It's a fair compromise and closer to my limit."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $9,500 is too high, but I can do $9,375. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375

Alice's offer of $9,375 is within your budget and closer to your preferred price than John's offer of $10,000. It's a good deal to accept."
