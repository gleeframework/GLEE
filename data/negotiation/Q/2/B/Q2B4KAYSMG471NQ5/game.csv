"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, $850,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",900000.0,Bob,4,
