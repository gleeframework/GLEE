# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
