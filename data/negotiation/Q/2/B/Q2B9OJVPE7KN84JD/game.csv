"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return on this product. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
