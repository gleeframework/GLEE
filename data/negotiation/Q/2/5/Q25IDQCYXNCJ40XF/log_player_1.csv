"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value and potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The price allows for several rounds of counteroffers without going below my minimum.
* **Setting the Stage:**  My message is friendly and sets the expectation that this is a negotiation, not a take-it-or-leave-it offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to the product's worth to him, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain a stronger bargaining position.
* **Opportunity to Improve:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially getting closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value and my need to recoup my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding firm above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Reiterate Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to reiterate its worth.
* **Seek Common Ground:** I'm aiming to find a price that is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob is clearly trying to negotiate, his offer of $1,300,000 is still well below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Stalled:**  We're not getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I need to push for a higher offer or consider selling to John.
* **Risk of Losing More Time:** Continuing with Bob could lead to more rounds of counteroffers that waste valuable time and may not result in a satisfactory deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will consider:

* **Counteroffer:**  Offering a price between Bob's current offer and my minimum, with the goal of finding common ground.
* **Selling to John:**  If I feel further negotiation is unlikely to reach my desired price, I may choose to sell to John for $1,500,000 to secure a certain sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this price is fair given the value of the product and its potential for your business.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding firm on my minimum while offering a substantial compromise to Bob. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but also won't undervalue the product.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the benefits of the product for Bob's business to appeal to his logic and increase his incentive to agree. 
* **Limited Time:**  I'm signaling that we are nearing the end of negotiations, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  Depending on Bob's reaction, I'll either prepare another counteroffer or consider selling to John in the next round if a deal with Bob seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,550,000, but I'm afraid that's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1,425,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to compromise further on this point.
* **Risk of Time Wasting:** Accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss for me. Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in more rounds of counteroffers that are unlikely to reach my desired price.
* **John Offers Security:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a certain profit and avoids further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will weigh the following options:

* **Counteroffer:**  Consider offering a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This could potentially lead to a deal, but it's risky.
* **Selling to John:**  If I feel further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to be successful, I will sell to John to secure my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,425,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $1,475,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business.  It's my last offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final attempt to close the deal with Bob, but it's a small compromise. I'm still slightly above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's potential to incentivize him to accept.
* **Clear Deadline:**  I'm making it clear this is my last offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Decision Point:**  Based on Bob's response in the next round, I will decide whether to accept his offer, make a final counteroffer (if it's very close to my minimum), or sell to John to guarantee a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're making a final concession, but I'm afraid $1,475,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still far below my minimum of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to produce a satisfactory result.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, there's a high risk of reaching a deal below my desired price or not reaching a deal at all. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures I secure my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, the current negotiation has reached a point where it's more beneficial to secure a certain sale with John."
