"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that much for it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value and my need to recoup my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this price is fair given the value of the product and its potential for your business.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,550,000, but I'm afraid that's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1,425,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,425,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $1,475,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business.  It's my last offer. Let me know your decision.",1475000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're making a final concession, but I'm afraid $1,475,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
