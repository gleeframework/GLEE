"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget ($1,200,000).  While the product is worth more to Bob than the price Alice is offering, Bob can get the product for his maximum price from John.  It's more beneficial for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
