Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $10,000, and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and be willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000.  This is a  significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value.  We're getting close to my minimum, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum value, it's getting late in the negotiation and there's a risk that Bob will walk away. I'm also not sure if John is a reliable buyer, so I'm taking the sure thing and closing the deal with Bob."
