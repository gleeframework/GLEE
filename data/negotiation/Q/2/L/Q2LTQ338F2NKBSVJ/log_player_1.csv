"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $1,800,000. This leaves room for negotiation but also demonstrates my understanding of the product's value.  I'm confident Bob will at least consider it, and we can then work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still have some room to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,700,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway, while still aiming for a higher price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and closer to my ideal price. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob."
