"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $18000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",19500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $17000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, I think $17000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $18750?",18750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $17500 for the product. Can we try to get closer to my target?",17500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18250. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",18250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $18250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $17500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",17500.0,Bob,8,
