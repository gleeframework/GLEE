Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. She wants to maximize her profit but also leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob pushes back, while still staying well above Alice's minimum price. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a safety net with John's offer of $1,000,000. This gives her a strong position to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. There are other strategies Alice could use, such as:

* **Going even higher:**  Alice could start closer to $1,200,000, hoping Bob is highly motivated and might accept immediately. However, this carries a higher risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright.
* **Providing more context:**  Alice could include a brief explanation of the product's value proposition to further justify the price to Bob."
