Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that.  It's also a fair price for me, given its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $1,100,000. This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've framed the message to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product to Bob.  I've also stated that this price is fair for both of us, creating a sense of shared interest.

**Strategy:**

* By starting high, I increase my chances of getting a good price.
* The message helps to build rapport and establish a positive negotiating environment.
* This offer allows for flexibility. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers. However, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John, ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to my desired profit, it's not enough to justify accepting his offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I will be mindful of John's offer of $1,200,000 and will be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers remain unsatisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,080,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a price that's acceptable to me.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer while still expressing my desire for a higher price. I've also emphasized that this new price is a compromise that benefits both of us, making it sound more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our two initial positions.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer that's too low.
* **Staying positive:**  The tone of the message remains friendly, encouraging further negotiation."
