"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can get the same product from John for a lower price. It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
