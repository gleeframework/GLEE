Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to start with a higher offer to see if we can secure a better deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer provides some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** We have a safety net with John who will buy the product at our minimum price, so we can afford to be a little bolder with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. How we proceed will depend on Bob's response. If he outright rejects the offer, we can gradually lower the price, but never going below our $10,000 minimum."
