"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $800,000. I believe this is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $700,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle on $600,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $650,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I can tell we both want to make this deal happen.  How about we split the difference and settle on $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $625,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",625000.0,Alice,7,
