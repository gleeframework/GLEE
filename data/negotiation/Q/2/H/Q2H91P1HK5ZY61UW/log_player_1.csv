Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning that I think Bob will like the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm offering a price of $105, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm also trying to be positive and encouraging by saying that I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to drop that low, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
