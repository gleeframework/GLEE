"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This still offers you a good value and leaves room for further discussion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering I could get it for $8,000 elsewhere. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I've considered your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to accept $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is a fair compromise considering I can get it elsewhere for $8,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",9800.0,Bob,6,
