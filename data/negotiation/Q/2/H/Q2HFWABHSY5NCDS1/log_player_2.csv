"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he shouldn't pay more than that.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if she's willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This still offers you a good value and leaves room for further discussion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than what he can get from John. He should counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his goal."

I'm prepared to accept $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.
