"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. Is that something you'd consider?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500?  I think that would be a fair deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",8500.0,Alice,5,
