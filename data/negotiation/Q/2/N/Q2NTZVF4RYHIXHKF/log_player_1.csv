Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate and potentially settle for a lower price. 
* **It shows confidence in the product's value:** By setting a high price, I'm implicitly communicating that I believe the product is worth a lot.
* **It sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving us both the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price.

I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always keep in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. If Bob's counteroffers keep falling below that threshold, I'll switch to John as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle immediately. Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and it's likely he's willing to pay more. I'll send him a counteroffer to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to accept his lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,100,000. While it's still less than what I initially hoped for, it's a significant improvement over his first counteroffer and gets me closer to my goal of maximizing profits. It's also a good outcome considering that John would only pay $1,000,000."
