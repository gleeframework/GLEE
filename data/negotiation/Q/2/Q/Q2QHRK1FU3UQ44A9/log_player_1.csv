"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this price immediately.  It sets the tone for negotiation and gives me room to move down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my value than Bob's.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but also highlights the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $13,500 is getting close to my minimum, I believe I can secure a higher offer. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm making another concession but staying above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still preserving a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and while $13,000 isn't terrible, I don't want to risk going lower.  I'm confident I can get my minimum value with John, so I'll sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
