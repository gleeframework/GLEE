"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting at $10,000. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only do $8,500 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value to me and gives us both a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which is closer to my initial offer and a good compromise. Let's meet in the middle.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and my costs. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
