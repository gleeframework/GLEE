Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. I still believe he'll come up in his offer, and I want to maximize my profit.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $110? It's a great deal for you and still leaves me a little room to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there. How about $108?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

While $108 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more. Bob clearly wants the product and I think I can get closer to my initial offer with a few more rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get the best value for my product. How about we split the difference and go with $109?  It's just a dollar more than your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 109}
