"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a quick deal while keeping my own minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer.  I need to hold firm and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still below my minimum price of $15,000, even though he's getting closer. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get him to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This price is fair, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to come up a little more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're close on price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
