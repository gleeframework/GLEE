Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects this offer, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to accept it and sell the product to him.  While I would prefer to sell it for more, I'm happy with $15,000. It's better to close the deal than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale entirely."
