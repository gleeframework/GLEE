"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1100000 is significantly below the product's true value and what it's worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1175000. This allows for a reasonable profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
