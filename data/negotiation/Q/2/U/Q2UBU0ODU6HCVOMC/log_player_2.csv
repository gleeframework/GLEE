"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $95 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a decent offer, there is room for negotiation. It is best to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However,  $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to lower the price to $90. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate. While $90 is closer to his target, he can still try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $90 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After considering our conversation, I am willing to agree on a price of $88 for the product. This is the lowest price I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept this offer. Alice has come down to $88, which is within his budget and a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at a higher price."
