"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer of $900,000 would exceed his $800,000 limit. Buying from John for $800,000 is a viable option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but still above his limit.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice will continue lowering her price to avoid losing the sale to John."
