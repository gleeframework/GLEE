"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I think I can do better than that. Let's aim for $11,000. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is clearly not willing to budge below $11,000.  It's unlikely she'll suddenly drop to $10,000 in the remaining rounds. It's more efficient to cut your losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $10,000."
