Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:** This price gives me a significant profit ($1,500) while still being potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  Leaving some room for negotiation allows for potential counteroffers and a chance for us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm happy to make a deal, $10,500 is too far below my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I want to try and find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's Offer:** It's a significant increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Lower than my Initial Offer:**  It's also a reduction from my initial price, showing flexibility. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** This price still guarantees me a decent profit and is closer to my ideal outcome.

This counteroffer should encourage Bob to consider coming closer to my desired price."
