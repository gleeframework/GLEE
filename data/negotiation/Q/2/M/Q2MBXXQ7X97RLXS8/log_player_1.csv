``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with something closer to my ideal price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still a bit higher than $850,000.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000 as a final compromise.  This gives us both a good deal, and ensures a successful transaction. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

While $887,500 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I'll reject and try to negotiate closer to my preferred price point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $887,500 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we meet at $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, and would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tough, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, with only a couple of rounds left, the chances of getting a higher offer are decreasing.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, as he's guaranteed to buy at a price that's acceptable to me."
