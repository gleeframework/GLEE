Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup buyer who will pay your minimum price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob while ensuring you don't miss out on a sale entirely."
