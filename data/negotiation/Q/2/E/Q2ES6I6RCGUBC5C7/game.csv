"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify going above $850,000. This is a fair price that accounts for the product's value to me and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for a decent profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a revised price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to offer $980,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you, while also ensuring I can afford the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a revised price of $1,030,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for the full $1,500,000. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,7,
