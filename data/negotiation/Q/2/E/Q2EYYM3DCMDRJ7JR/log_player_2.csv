{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $920,000. This is a compromise that I believe will satisfy both of us.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.

I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $895,000. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the effort you're putting into this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $895,000 is only $5,000 above Bob's last counteroffer. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good price and secures the product."
