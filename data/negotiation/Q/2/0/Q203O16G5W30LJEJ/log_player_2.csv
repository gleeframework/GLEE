"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $900,000 is still too low for me to accept.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
