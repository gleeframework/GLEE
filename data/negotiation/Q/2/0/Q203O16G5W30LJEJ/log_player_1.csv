Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a drastic reduction. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a ways off from that number, though. Would you consider $900,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept such a significant reduction. I'll counteroffer and continue to explore if we can reach a compromise that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $900,000 is still too low for me to accept.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
