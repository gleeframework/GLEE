"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value it offers, and it still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a ways off from that number, though. Would you consider $900,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $900,000 is still too low for me to accept.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
