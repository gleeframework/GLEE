Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $90 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still looking to get closer to $100.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too low on budget. How about we go for $85? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum of $80, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to meet in the middle again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $87.50 is close to my minimum, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $80."
