{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly opening and aims to get Bob thinking about the product's value.  The price is significantly lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100? This is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
