"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $80.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You should reject the offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100? This is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum of $80. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $80, there's no need to continue negotiating.  It's better to secure the product from John at the lower price."
