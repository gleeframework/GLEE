You want to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need at least $825,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

While $825,000 is closer to your goal, you can still try to negotiate further. It's possible to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $780,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $780,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

Alice has finally come down to your maximum price, and you can secure the product for the same price as you would get from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating further."
