# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can save potentially $2,000 by getting a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
