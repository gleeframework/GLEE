Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob to incentivize him to accept. I'm also keeping the tone friendly and positive to encourage a smooth negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a price that's attractive to Bob while still giving me a decent profit. I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I have a backup buyer in John, who is willing to pay my full asking price. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still significantly less.  I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.
* **I have leverage with John:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at a low price. 
* **Negotiation is key:** I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000.  I'll try to find a compromise that is appealing to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price closer to my initial value.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm suggesting finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between holding my ground and pushing for a deal with Bob. I'm still above my minimum price but open to further discussion. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise to close the deal."
