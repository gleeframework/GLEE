Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, we can afford to start the negotiation significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level. By mentioning it's a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency. 
* **Justification:** We don't explicitly state why the product is worth this price to Bob, allowing him to justify the value himself and potentially meet us closer to our asking price. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can always negotiate down towards $10,000. However, starting high gives us the best chance to maximize our profit."
