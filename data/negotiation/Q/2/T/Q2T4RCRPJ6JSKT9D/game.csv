"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500?  I'm very interested in the product and am confident it would be a valuable addition to my collection.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see your point. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
