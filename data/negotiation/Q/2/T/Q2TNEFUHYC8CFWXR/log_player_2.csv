{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. You have three options: accept, reject, or buy from John. Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to your limit.  While buying from John is always an option, continuing to negotiate with Alice might yield a better deal, especially considering you have several rounds left."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your preferred price, $155 is still above your budget. You have three options: accept, reject, or buy from John. Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to your limit.  While buying from John is always an option, continuing to negotiate with Alice might yield a better deal, especially considering you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still just a bit too much for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $145, as that's the very top of my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $155 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $152.50. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152.50 is still above your budget of $120.  You have a few rounds left, but it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  At this point, you're better off buying the product from John for $120.  While you might be able to get a slightly better price from Alice, there's no guarantee, and you risk running out of time.  Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further potential negotiation delays."
