"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $825,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $760,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and the current market.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $780,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",790000.0,Alice,7,
