"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $825,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $760,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and the current market."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.
