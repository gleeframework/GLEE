Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum value of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counteroffer at a price closer to your target without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious:** You're not starting at a ridiculously high price, but you're also not giving away the product for cheap. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is below our minimum acceptable price of $100. While selling to John for $100 is an option, we can likely get a better price from Bob. We have the advantage here, as we know he values the product at $150.

**Next Steps:**

We'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to our target, aiming for a price that's still attractive to him but also profitable for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring we make a profit.
* **Positive Language:**  The message uses positive language to emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Focus on Value:**  We're reminding Bob that even at $120, he's getting a product worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $120 is still a touch high. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $115 is slightly above our minimum acceptable price of $100. While we can continue negotiating, it's likely we won't be able to get much higher.  Considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and the fact that we're already making a profit, accepting his offer seems like the most logical choice."
