Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While the product is worth $100 to both you and Bob, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure it. Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation or acceptance of the initial offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning your belief in the product's value (""worth at least $100""), you subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind and provide a reason for your offer.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  If Bob rejects the $120 offer, you haven't lost anything. You can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
