"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving space for compromise:** The price is also below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly tone and asking for Bob's thoughts sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but can't go above $1,200,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates my commitment to getting a better price and strengthens my negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. To move forward, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,600,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the initial $1,750,000.
* **Maintaining value:** The new offer is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, ensuring I get a decent return.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the shared goal of finding a solution. This encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in Round 4. I have ample time to continue negotiations and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer:**  Remember, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer if it doesn't meet my minimum.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push him closer to my minimum in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but it's still above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm leaving room for a slight negotiation but making it clear that this is my bottom line. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the compromise I'm making. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,550,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the price difference between our previous positions. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is a factor:** We are now in Round 6, and there's a risk that if we continue to negotiate, we might not be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. 

Therefore, it's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds."
