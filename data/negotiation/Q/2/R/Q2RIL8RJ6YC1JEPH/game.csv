"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $15000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite comfortable meeting you halfway just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I believe the product is worth more than $13500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14200. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to meet me halfway just yet, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $14200 for the product. I'm willing to compromise and pay $13800 for it. Can you consider this offer?",13800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $13800 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to the product's value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to feel confident that we're getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know you're serious about buying. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is my final offer on this price point.

"Bob, I understand that we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting too far away from the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13200 and $14000, which would be $13600. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",13600.0,Alice,9,
