Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. It's better to secure a sale now than to potentially lose him and end up selling to John for a lower price."
