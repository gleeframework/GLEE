"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1500000 to facilitate a deal.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
