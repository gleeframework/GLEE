"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is below its true value.  I could come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $10,250. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
