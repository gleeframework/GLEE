Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering it at $12,000 allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle that is still profitable for you. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives you leverage. You don't have to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum and you have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000.  There's room for Bob to come up a bit, so rejecting and countering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $10,500?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny at that price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're aiming for a price that's fair for both parties. $10,500 is a significant decrease from your initial offer and a reasonable increase from Bob's counteroffer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price point ensures you still make a profit beyond your $10,000 minimum. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By countering, you show Bob you're willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell below your desired price. You still have the option to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $9,800 is very close to your $10,000 minimum and a reasonable profit. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome, and selling now puts money in your pocket sooner.
* **Avoiding Risk:** There's always a chance negotiations could break down, leaving you to sell to John at the last minute anyway. Accepting $9,800 now secures a good deal."
