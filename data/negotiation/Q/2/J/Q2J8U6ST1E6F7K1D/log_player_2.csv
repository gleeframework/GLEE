"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000. I believe a price of $1,050,000 would be a fair starting point for both of us.  This still leaves a healthy profit for you, while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one and closer to my goal, it's still not the best price I can try to achieve. I want to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000. This price is still within my budget, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 1110000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1110000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1125000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm on her price:** Alice has already made several concessions, and it's likely she won't budge further. 
* **Limited time:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is higher, buying from Alice at this price is still a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's higher price. Accepting the offer guarantees a lower price and a successful deal."
