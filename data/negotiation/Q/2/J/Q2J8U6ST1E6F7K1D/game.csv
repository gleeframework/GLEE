"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1200000. I believe a price of $1050000 would be a fair starting point for both of us.  This still leaves a healthy profit for you, while allowing me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $1150000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1050000.  Would you be willing to consider $1100000 as a final price? This would still be a significant profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
