"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider my offer?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $125 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to negotiating further, but I can't go lower than $140.  Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $125 was a bit too low, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll accept $135. This is my final offer.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132, but no higher. Can you consider my offer?",132.0,Bob,6,
