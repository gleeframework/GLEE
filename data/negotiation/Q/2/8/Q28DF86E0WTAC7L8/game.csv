"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $18000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
