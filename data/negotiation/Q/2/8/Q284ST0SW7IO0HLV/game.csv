"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $250?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a price of $220, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $220 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $190 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",190.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $190 and $220, so I can offer you $205. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",205.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $195 for the product. Can you consider this price?",195.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller margin, so I can offer you $200. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $200. I'm willing to pay $185 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",185.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made a few concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $200. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go any lower than $200, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $185. If not, I'll buy it from John for $120.",185.0,Bob,10,
