"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still well above the value you've placed on the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try one more time to push for my desired price before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still a bit far from my ideal price. I'm willing to drop to $14,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob seems stuck on his budget. With only four rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better deal from him. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
