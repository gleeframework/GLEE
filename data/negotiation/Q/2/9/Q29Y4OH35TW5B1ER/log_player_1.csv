Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $200,000 if he buys from you.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit above the $1,000,000 baseline.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it allows him some profit) but also gives you a significant share of the potential gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, emphasizing exclusivity and value to Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 profit margin, which is a good incentive for him to buy. You, in turn, secure an additional $150,000 above your guaranteed offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:**  This offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important long-term, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a win-win outcome.
