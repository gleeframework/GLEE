Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial price is $1,400,000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I will counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product will provide. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000, but I'm still slightly over budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,225,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to close the deal!"
