"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial price is $1,400,000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product will provide. Let's close this deal now.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000, but I'm still slightly over budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,225,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
