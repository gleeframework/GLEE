Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum price. While I could push for more, there's a risk he might walk away.
