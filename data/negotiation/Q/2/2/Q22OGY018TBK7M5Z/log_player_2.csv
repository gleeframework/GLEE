"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for no more than $120. Alice's initial offer of $180 is way above that. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the product is worth $120 to him, so he starts by offering the lowest price he's willing to pay. This sets a strong baseline and forces Alice to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  He's now offering $130, which is a compromise. He's showing he's willing to negotiate, but still keeping the price close to his maximum.  This hopefully encourages Alice to consider a deal before he goes with John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is getting closer to Bob's limit, he's still only three rounds away from buying from John for $120. There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and Bob can likely get closer to his target with a few more rounds. He should continue to negotiate before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 138} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a small compromise, increasing his offer by $3 to $138. He's demonstrating that he's willing to negotiate, but still trying to keep the price as low as possible. With only two rounds left, the pressure is mounting, and Bob is showing that he's not afraid to walk away if Alice doesn't come down further. This move could encourage Alice to accept the offer, or at least make a final counteroffer that's closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, Alice's offer of $142 is still too high for Bob. He's only two rounds away from being able to buy the product from John for $120. There's not enough time left to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Therefore, the best course of action is to buy the product from John."
