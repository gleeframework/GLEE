Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is only slightly below your maximum budget. Given that you only have a few rounds left, it's better to go with John's offer of $800,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept your counteroffer, and you risk missing out on a good deal with John."
