Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your response, I must respectfully decline. My budget is strictly limited to $1,000,000 for this purchase. I understand that may not align with the perceived value of the product, but it's the maximum I can afford. I hope this proposal is acceptable, or I'll have to look elsewhere for this product.

Bob is nowhere near my minimum price. It's clear he's unwilling to budge significantly.  There's no point in wasting more time negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price."
