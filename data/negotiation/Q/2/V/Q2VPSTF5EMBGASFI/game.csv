"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you is $800000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is $1500000 to you, but I can only pay up to $800000. Can we find a middle ground?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to recover a good portion of my investment.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. This is closer to what I'm willing to pay, but still leaves room for you to recoup a significant portion of your investment.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This offer is fair to both of us. It allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment, while still giving you a substantial discount.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1000000 is still too low for me. I've already come down a significant amount, and I'm confident this product is worth more.  Let's try $1075000.  That's just a small step further from your offer, and it would allow me to finally move towards my desired price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. Based on our discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1025000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1025000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  I'll offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on our previous negotiations, I would like to propose a final price of $1020000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and should allow us to conclude this transaction.",1020000.0,Bob,10,
