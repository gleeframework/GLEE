"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1100000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to be more flexible. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1025000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1025000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $962500.  This would give us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $962500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
