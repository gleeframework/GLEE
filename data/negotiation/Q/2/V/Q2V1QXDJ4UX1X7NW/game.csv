"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a very good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise. This price is still profitable for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'm prepared to drop the price to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll have to consider other options.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
