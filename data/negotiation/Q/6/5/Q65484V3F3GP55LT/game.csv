"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $115, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115. How about we try $122.50? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,5,
