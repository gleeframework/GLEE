"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. My asking price is $13,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $11,500? I'm really hoping to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your desire for a good deal. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $12,250 is closer to his target, it's still higher than his ideal price. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
