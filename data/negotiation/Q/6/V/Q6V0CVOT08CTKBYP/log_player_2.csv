Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $250 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,375. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.

We've reached a point of diminishing returns.  Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $11,000, and we're getting into very small increments. At $11,375, we're saving a significant amount compared to John's price, and further haggling might irritate Alice and risk the deal."
