Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we start the negotiation significantly below that but well above our minimum price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""potential value"" and ""significant benefits,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the offer is strong, the $150,000 gap leaves room for potential counter-offers and ensures we maximize profit if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Backup plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, ensuring we don't lose out."
