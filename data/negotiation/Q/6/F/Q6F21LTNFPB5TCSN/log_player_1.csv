"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I want to see if I can push Bob further. If he doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price point while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum goal of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm hopeful that Bob will increase his offer in the next round. If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly again. I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot that convinces Bob to buy. If he still rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll make another counteroffer and see if he'll budge. If not, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm making one final counteroffer before I consider selling to John. This price is still above my minimum but also a good compromise. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, but if not, I'll sell to John in the next round to avoid losing too much time and potentially lowering the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to negotiate further.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation, I'm going to sell to John and secure my minimum profit."
