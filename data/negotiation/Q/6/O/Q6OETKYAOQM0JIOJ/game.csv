"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this price reflects its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a bit more to meet my expectations. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1350000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1250000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is my next best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this revised offer?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
