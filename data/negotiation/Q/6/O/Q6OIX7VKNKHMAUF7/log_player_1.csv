Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start with a price significantly above Bob's valuation but below your guaranteed sale price.
* **Justification:**  You vaguely mention ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to anchor the price in Bob's mind without revealing specifics that might weaken your position.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still highly profitable for you.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to give the impression of concession later. 
* **Market Information:** If you had information about Bob's urgency to acquire the product, you could adjust your approach accordingly.

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy.  The actual negotiation may involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
