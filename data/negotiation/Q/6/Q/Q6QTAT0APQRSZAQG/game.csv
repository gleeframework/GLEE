"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value, and I know it would be extremely valuable for your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair offer, and it's the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,025,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm starting to feel like we're too far apart. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
