"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value, and I know it would be extremely valuable for your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below market value, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above my absolute maximum. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both parties, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and create a win-win scenario.
* **Room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds, while still keeping the price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer than her initial offer, I still have room for negotiation, and I'm not yet willing to pay more than $1,000,000. Buying from John at that price is always a viable option, so I'll continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair offer, and it's the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my budget. 
* **Final offer:** I'm positioning this as my final offer, hoping to pressure Alice to accept.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing this as a ""fair"" offer, emphasizing that both of us are making compromises.
* **Leaving room:**  While this is my ""final"" offer, there is still a small amount of wiggle room for further negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,025,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm starting to feel like we're too far apart. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $50,000 over my absolute limit. Given that Alice has already stated this is her ""final offer,"" and we're only 5 rounds into the negotiation, I'm confident that further counteroffers will likely be unsuccessful. It's better to buy from John at $1,000,000, securing the product within my budget, than risk potentially losing the deal and having to pay more."
