"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1500000. I believe it's a fair starting point considering its potential value. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your perspective, $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1375000. This price reflects the product's true worth and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1375000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1312500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1312500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $1312500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1343750.  This is a compromise that acknowledges your budget while also reflecting the true value of the product.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1343750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1343750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1317375. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we meet at this price?",1317375.0,Bob,6,
