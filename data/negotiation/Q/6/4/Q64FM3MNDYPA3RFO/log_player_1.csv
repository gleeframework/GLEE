Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good starting point, and if Bob isn't willing to pay that, we can negotiate.  I'm also leaving room for a counteroffer, as I'm confident the product is worth more than $80 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and selling to John would only net me $80. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale for $90, which is a better outcome."
