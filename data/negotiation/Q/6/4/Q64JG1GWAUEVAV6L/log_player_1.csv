I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further."

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my desired price range, and it's more than what John is offering. It's a good deal for both of us, so I will accept Bob's offer."
