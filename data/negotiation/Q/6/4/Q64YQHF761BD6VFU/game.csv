"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher offer. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I place on the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm not willing to meet your original asking price, I'm also unable to go above $1,320,000. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring I'm getting a good deal for myself.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
