This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to explore if Bob is willing to pay closer to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher offer. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm not willing to meet your original asking price, I'm also unable to go above $1,320,000. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring I'm getting a good deal for myself. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,320,000 is still a good deal considering my minimum price and the possibility of Bob walking away.  It's important to be realistic and secure the deal."
