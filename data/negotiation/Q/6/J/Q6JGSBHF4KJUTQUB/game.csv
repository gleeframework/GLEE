"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this exceptional product.

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1275000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,,
