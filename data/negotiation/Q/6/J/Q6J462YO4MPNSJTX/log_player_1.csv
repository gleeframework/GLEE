Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, it's strategic to start with a higher offer to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at flexibility, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate, which can be a good tactic to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating its worth, the message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's perceived $8,000, prompting him to reconsider his initial valuation.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a successful negotiation."
