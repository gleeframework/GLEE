"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down in price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I'll meet you at $9,050. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,9,
