"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll make a great decision. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's a good idea to start negotiating. Alice's first offer is closer to her value than yours, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin with an offer significantly below your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to bargain.
* **Anchoring:**  By presenting $900,000, you're setting a lower anchor point for the negotiation.  While Alice is unlikely to accept immediately, it shifts the conversation towards a lower price range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer gives you space to gradually increase your bid if needed while still aiming for a price well below Alice's asking price and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $980,000. It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving closer to your price, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aiming for a lower price and encourage her to make further concessions. You're still below John's $1,000,000 offer, so you haven't reached a point where you'd lose money by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $940,000?"", ""product_price"": 940000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer demonstrates a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can be effective in creating a sense of fairness and encouraging agreement.
* **Staying Below John's Offer:**  Crucially, you remain below your backup price, ensuring you have a safety net if negotiations stall."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $960,000. It's a slight adjustment from your offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and this price is a good deal for you, saving you $40,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a smaller difference carries the risk that Alice might walk away or become less willing to compromise. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching an agreement now saves you the time and potential hassle of continuing negotiations or working with another seller."
