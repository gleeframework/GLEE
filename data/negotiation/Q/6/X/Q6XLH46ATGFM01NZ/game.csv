,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I think that's fair considering the value we both see in this product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $100.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about $110?  It's a fair price that's still within your profit margin.",110.0,Bob,4,
