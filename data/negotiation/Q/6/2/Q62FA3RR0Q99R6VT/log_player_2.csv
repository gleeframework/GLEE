Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth more, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay. Since Alice's last offer was $10,500, I'll make a counteroffer that's $500 lower. I'll offer $10,000, which is the price John is willing to sell it to me for.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. This is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
