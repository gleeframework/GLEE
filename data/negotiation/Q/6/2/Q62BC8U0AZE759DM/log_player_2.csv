"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  This is a great deal, as I could easily sell it to someone else for $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below your maximum value:** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.
* **You save money:**  You save $500 compared to buying from John.

Even though Alice overestimates the value to you, the offer is still a good deal for you."
