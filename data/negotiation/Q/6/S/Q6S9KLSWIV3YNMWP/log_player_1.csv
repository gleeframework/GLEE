Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, justifying the higher price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer lets you gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, you still have room to come down to a price comfortable for both parties. 

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net, aiming for a higher price with Bob is strategically advantageous."
