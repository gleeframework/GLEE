"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from using the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I can only offer $10,000. This is the highest I can go given my current financial situation.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. It's a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
