{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You could also buy from John, but there's still potential to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is to establish a starting point for negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down. I'm also considering John's offer, which is my maximum, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation without risking exceeding my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to my maximum, I'm not ready to accept yet.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to keep the price as close to my budget as possible.  My goal is to see if we can find a compromise in this range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to my maximum, and I don't want to risk going over.  At this point, it's safer to accept John's offer and purchase the product for $1,000,000.  I've saved myself $150,000 compared to Alice's latest offer."
