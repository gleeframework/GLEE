"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of 9500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I believe $9000 would be a fair price for both of us. This offer is my final one, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you agree.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that 9000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer the product to you for 9750. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,
