{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a lower price point. It's likely Alice will counter, but we'll see if she's willing to negotiate further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. There's a good chance I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my target.  It's a reasonable middle ground that might make Alice more inclined to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  The negotiation is moving in the right direction, and I believe there's still room to bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to continue pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm starting to see a pattern in her offers.  I'm going to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous offer but still below her latest offer. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price.  I'm aiming for a compromise that will be mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price, but her offers are getting closer. I'm confident I can push her lower, and I'm still 8 rounds away from having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to make a final push to see if Alice will meet me halfway. This offer is a compromise between my last counteroffer and Alice's current offer, demonstrating my willingness to close the deal.  If she rejects this, I'm prepared to buy from John, but I want to give Alice one last chance to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round before I have to buy from John. Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my target, but it's the best price she's offered so far. There's a high chance she won't budge further, and I'm running out of time.  It's a better deal than buying from John, so it's worth accepting and closing the deal."
