"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $150. Considering its high quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it would be an excellent addition to your collection. I kindly invite you to accept this offer at the same value of $150, ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. Should you have any questions or require further information, please don't hesitate to ask. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own value, leaving no room for you to save money.  Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a better price with John."
