"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000.  I have 8 rounds left and a guaranteed buyer at a much higher price.  It makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet your current offer of $10,500. I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have time and a guaranteed buyer at a significantly higher price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to counter your offer with $10,000. I believe this price is fair and within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 6, and Bob is sticking to $10,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, we only have 4 rounds left. The risk is that Bob won't budge, and I'll be stuck with a much lower price than I could get from John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
