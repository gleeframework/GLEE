"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could we settle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a slight compromise at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
