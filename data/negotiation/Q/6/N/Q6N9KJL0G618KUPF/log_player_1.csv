"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $775,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $740,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $740,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's latest offer of $740,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  Therefore, I'll accept John's offer of $800,000."
