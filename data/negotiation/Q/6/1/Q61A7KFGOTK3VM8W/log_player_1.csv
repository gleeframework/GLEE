"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $175. It's a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$115 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will continue to negotiate with him. I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm going down to $160. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more flexible, but I don't want to sell too low either."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of time, $120 is still too low. I'm willing to risk losing this deal to John, hoping Bob will come up with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm now offering my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a big concession, but I'm running out of time and I'm willing to accept this price to avoid selling to John. Hopefully, Bob will finally accept."
