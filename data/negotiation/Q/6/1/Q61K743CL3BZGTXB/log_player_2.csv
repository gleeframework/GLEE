"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is within your budget, it's still more than Alice's value of $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her value of $12,000. This leaves room for further negotiation without being too aggressive.  It also shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are determined to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and also leaves some profit margin for Alice. Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a higher price or even a breakdown in the negotiations."
