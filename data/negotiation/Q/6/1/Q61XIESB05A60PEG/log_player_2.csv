"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $80. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a backup if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're starting with your maximum price, knowing Alice values the product at $100. This gives you a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is still above your $80 limit, but closer to your counteroffer. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further, especially since you have the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

You're increasing your counteroffer slightly, showing Alice you're willing to compromise but still staying within your budget. This approach keeps the negotiations moving and might lead to a final price that's acceptable to both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still above your $80 limit.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, it makes the most sense to accept John's offer and save yourself the further negotiation and potential risk of Alice not agreeing to your counteroffer."
