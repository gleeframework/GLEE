"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I can't accept anything below $1,700,000 for this product. Its unique features and market potential justify this price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
