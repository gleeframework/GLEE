Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to pay $11,000, but I'll throw in an additional $500 as a bonus if you meet me at this price. Can we make a deal at $10,500?

This is a tough call, but I think it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I could continue negotiating, Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher than $11,000, and his bonus offer is not enough to make up the difference.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
