Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, $600,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $650,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably in price, and $650,000 is a significant savings. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result, and you risk Alice raising the price again."
