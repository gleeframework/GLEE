"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $800,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $600,000. Would that price point be workable for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, $600,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $650,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",650000.0,Alice,5,
