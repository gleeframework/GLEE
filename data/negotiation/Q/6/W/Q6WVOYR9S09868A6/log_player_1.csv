"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
