"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
