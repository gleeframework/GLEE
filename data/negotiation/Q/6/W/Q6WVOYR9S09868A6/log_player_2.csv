"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** While $900,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget, you have room to negotiate for a better price. 
* **You want to explore your options.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to go lower and gives you control over the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** $850,000 is a good price for you, significantly lower than your maximum budget and closer to your initial counteroffer. 
* **Time is a factor.** It's only the third round, and you're already getting close to a deal.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing this opportunity and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **The product's value is worth it.**  You've already determined the product is valuable to you, so accepting this offer makes sense."
