"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, it's still within the range of what Bob could potentially negotiate down further. There are 9 more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $750,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point for Bob's counteroffers, pushing Alice towards a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still below the price from John.  It makes sense to keep negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so there is time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. By offering $800,000, he's showing flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still maintaining his goal of getting a good deal. This is a good strategy to test Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher, but it's still lower than John's price.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice closer to his target price. There are still several rounds remaining, so it's worth persisting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is becoming more aggressive. To counter, Bob is making a more modest counteroffer of $825,000,  trying to bridge the gap between his previous offer and Alice's current one.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise without significantly increasing his offer. There are still several rounds left, and this move gives Bob a chance to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now getting closer to John's price. However, there are still a few rounds left, and Bob should continue negotiating. There is still a chance that Alice might be willing to drop her price further to close the deal, especially as it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly closer to John's price. To avoid going to John, Bob needs to make a substantial counteroffer. Offering $850,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and is now at Alice's initial offer. This shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal with her, but still believes a better price is possible.  With only 2 rounds remaining, this counteroffer is a calculated risk to see if Alice will cave and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $910,000 is getting uncomfortably close to John's price of $1,000,000. With only one round left, the chances of Alice significantly lowering her offer are slim.  There's a risk that in the final round, Alice might counter with an even higher price, pushing Bob into an unfavorable situation. To avoid this potential risk, Bob should secure the product from John, as it provides a guaranteed price and avoids any further negotiation."
