"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $115.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is starting quite high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  We should counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation.  
* **Clear Target:** My ideal price is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but I need to be prepared for her to counter. My goal is to get the price as close to $100 as possible without losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $102.50 is a reasonable compromise. While it's slightly above my ideal price, it's significantly lower than her initial offer and only slightly more expensive than buying from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a slightly better price, but there's also the risk that Alice walks away, and I'd have to buy from John anyway.  The potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing this deal."
