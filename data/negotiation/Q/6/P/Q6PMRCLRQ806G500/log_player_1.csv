"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm providing."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $7,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Explanation:

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet at a price that's advantageous for you.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance you'll need to drop your price significantly to make a deal. It's more profitable at this point to take John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
