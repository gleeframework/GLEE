Round 2
Bob's offer:

While I'm starting to get a bit concerned about time, $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer again, but if Bob doesn't come up significantly, I might have to consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $975,000 simply isn't enough for me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $987,500 is a better offer from Bob than before, it's still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price. With only 2 rounds left, I'm running out of time, and I'm not willing to risk losing a much better deal with John. So, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
