Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While $1,350,000 represents a fair valuation considering its potential, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about we settle at $1,200,000? I believe this price reflects a win-win for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures you're getting a great deal on a valuable product.
