"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less.  You can counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer.  $92.50 is still within your budget of $120 and you're likely to save more money than you would by buying from John."
