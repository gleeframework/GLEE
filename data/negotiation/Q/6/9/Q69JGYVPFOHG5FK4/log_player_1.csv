Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have room to negotiate. Bob seems anchored at 850,000 and unwilling to budge much past that.  Let's see if we can push him a little further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly anchored around $850,000 and is unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting his offer of $835,000 secures a substantial profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
