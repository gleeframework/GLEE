"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value. To be candid, my absolute floor on this is $1,450,000. I'm willing to come down slightly if it helps us reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,225,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price.  My final offer is $1,350,000.  This is the best I can do, otherwise I'll need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
