"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is still a significant amount compared to what the product is worth to him.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for potential negotiation and a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to what the product is worth to him. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, and a good starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for further negotiation while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He's still in the early rounds of negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a lower price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's willing to increase his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's serious about buying the product, but he's still significantly below Alice's offer.  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than the price he would pay from John.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and is getting closer to a deal. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
