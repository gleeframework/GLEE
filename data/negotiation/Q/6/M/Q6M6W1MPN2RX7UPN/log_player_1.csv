"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good profit margin. I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000, knowing he values it at $1,000,000. This gives him some room to negotiate while still giving me a significant profit.  I'll see how he reacts before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still ensuring a good profit.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to accept it at this point. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my initial target. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my previous offer.  If he continues to refuse, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm further reducing my offer to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for Bob. Hopefully, he'll accept this offer and we can close the deal. If he doesn't, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd still like to get a bit more, I'm concerned that he might not budge any further.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
