Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob the impression that there's room to bargain, incentivizing him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focusing on value:** My message emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect, implying a fair price without being overly aggressive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* If he's not willing to meet me halfway, I'll move on to John and secure the $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob is interested, he's not willing to meet my minimum.  I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to Bob at his price would mean a significant loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise.
* If he continues to be unwilling to budge, I'll move on to John and secure the $15,000 sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to a price of $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:**  My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum. This shows flexibility while ensuring a more favorable outcome for me.
* **Focusing on value for Bob:** I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob, emphasizing the potential savings compared to his initial value assessment.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I've clearly stated my position and what I'm willing to accept, encouraging Bob to make a final decision.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my desired value.
* If Bob rejects, I will carefully analyze his next move.  If he doesn't come closer to my minimum, I'll move on to John and secure the $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm not getting my full asking price, I can still potentially push for a higher price in the future.
* **Avoiding risk:**  There's a risk that Bob might walk away, or that John's offer might fall through. Accepting this offer secures a sale at a price that's almost as good as my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* I've secured a sale close to my minimum. 
* I can consider using the sale to John as a ""threat"" in future negotiations, if I choose to re-engage with Bob in the future."
