Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value than Bob's, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the potential win-win situation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to negotiation but establishes a firm starting point. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the door open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:**  His offer is $300,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John is a reliable backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage and security in the negotiation.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now, but I'm not immediately selling to John. I want to see if I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive and Open:**  The message remains positive and open to continuing the negotiation, encouraging Bob to reconsider.

This approach aims to find a middle ground that's both profitable for me and potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is only $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or I might end up settling for a lower price.
* **Time is money:**  Prolonging the negotiation takes time and effort. It's likely worth accepting this offer and moving on.

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
