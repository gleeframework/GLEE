"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
