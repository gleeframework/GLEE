"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your maximum budget is $120.**
* **Alice's offer is $115.** 
* **John is willing to sell for $120.**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your ideal price point. You can get the product for less by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
