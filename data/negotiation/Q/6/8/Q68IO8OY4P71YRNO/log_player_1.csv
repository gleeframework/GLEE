{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $115, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You're getting closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but even if he gets it down a little, you're still above your minimum. 
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** If you price too high (close to $120), Bob might reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for John's $100."
