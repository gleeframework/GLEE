"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $600,000?
