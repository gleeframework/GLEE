"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1250000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet your price of $1100000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit, so I'll counter with $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
