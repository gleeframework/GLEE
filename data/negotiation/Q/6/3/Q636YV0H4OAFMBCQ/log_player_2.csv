# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $885000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm hesitant to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $885,000 is very close to your desired price point of $875,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance you'll end up stuck in a stalemate.  This offer is a good deal for you, allowing you to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting to avoid further back-and-forth."
