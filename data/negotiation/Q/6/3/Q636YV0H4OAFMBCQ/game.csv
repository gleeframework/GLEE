"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm aiming to stay within a tighter budget.  I'd like to propose a price of $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and gives us both a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer a price of $900000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However,  $900000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's split the difference and settle on $875000. This price ensures we both get a good deal while staying within our respective budgets.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $885000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm hesitant to go any lower.",885000.0,Alice,5,
