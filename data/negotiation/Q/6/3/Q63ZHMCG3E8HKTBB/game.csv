"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $825,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand you want to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll come down to $790,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still not willing to go above $775,000. I've made a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $775,000.",775000.0,Bob,6,,
