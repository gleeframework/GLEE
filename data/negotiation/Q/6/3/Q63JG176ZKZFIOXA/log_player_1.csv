Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000) allows room for Bob to counter-offer. You might still secure a better deal than with John.
* **Maintain Confidence:**  The message implies the product's value while showing a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you are secure knowing John will purchase it for $15,000."
