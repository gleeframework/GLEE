{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $130 is still below my desired price, but it's close enough.  I'm happy to accept his offer and move on. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
