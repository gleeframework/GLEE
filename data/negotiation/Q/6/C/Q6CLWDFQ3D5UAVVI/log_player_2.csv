You can do better than $12,000.  Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to go lower than $11,500, and her counteroffer of $11,750 is still above my budget of $10,000. It's better to buy from John at this point and save myself the hassle of further negotiation."
