"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing that Bob has a lower valuation. This gives us room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe we can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $1,600,000.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating with Bob. I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm offering $1,550,000.  This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with the prospect of selling to John, I've reached a point where I don't believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'm running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting further away from my desired price, not closer.  It's time to secure the deal and ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
