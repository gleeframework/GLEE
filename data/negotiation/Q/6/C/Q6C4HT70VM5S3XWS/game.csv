,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about $8,500? I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll consider $9,750. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's worth it for this product.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a dedicated support package. For that, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. It's a great value for you, and I think it's worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still focused on getting the best price. While I value those additions, $10,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference again - I'm offering $9,750 for the product, including the warranty and support. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll throw in an additional 6 months of warranty and support, on top of the original offer. I think this is a great value for you, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,9,
