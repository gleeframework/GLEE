Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000. He's already negotiated as much as he can with Alice, and it seems like she's not willing to budge further. While buying from John is more expensive than he initially hoped, it's still within his budget, and he's running out of rounds. It's better to secure the product now rather than risk losing it and having to find another seller."
