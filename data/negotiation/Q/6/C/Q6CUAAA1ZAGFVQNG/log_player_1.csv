Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about $750,000?

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000. It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation and potentially losing a deal with John."
