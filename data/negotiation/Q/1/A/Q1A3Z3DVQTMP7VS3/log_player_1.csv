Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $500,000 surplus we can negotiate over.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you a negotiation advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without being outrageous.  Here's how I'd structure my offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I've carefully assessed its value, and given its unique potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability.
* **Confident Justification:**  Phrases like ""carefully assessed"" and ""unique potential"" subtly reinforce the product's high value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still landing you a significant profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. How you respond will depend on how much you want to close the deal quickly versus maximizing your potential profit."
