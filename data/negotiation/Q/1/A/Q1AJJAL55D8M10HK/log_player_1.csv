Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. This product has significant value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $1,250,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. It surpasses my minimum by a significant margin and avoids the risk of dragging out negotiations and potentially losing him as a buyer."
