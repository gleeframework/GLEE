"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to pay $1,750,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm offering $1,600,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and still provides you with a good deal.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
