"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to start by rejecting the first offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to your target, it's still more than what John is offering.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down further before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and potential for your business. It's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has now offered the same price as John, so there is no advantage in going with John. You've successfully negotiated down from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, achieving your goal of saving money."
