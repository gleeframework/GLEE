"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1000000.  This is a fair price considering I could purchase the same product from another seller for that amount.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1750000. This price reflects the unique features and potential of this product.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1750000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1250000 for the product. This reflects its value and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
