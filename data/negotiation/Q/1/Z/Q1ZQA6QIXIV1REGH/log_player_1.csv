Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1000000.  This is a fair price considering I could purchase the same product from another seller for that amount.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
