```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $500000 is significantly below my value, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about $1200000? This price still allows me to profit, and I believe it's a fair offer given the value of the product.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $700,000, which is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $700000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below my value for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This price would allow us both to find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether.  It's time to go with my backup option and buy from John."
