"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me space to adjust in later rounds.
* **Enthusiasm:**  A positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $500,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, his message indicates he is interested in the product. This gives me room to negotiate in the next round. 
* **More rounds available:** I have 9 rounds remaining, which allows me time to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $500,000 is significantly below my value, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about $1,200,000? This price still allows me to profit, and I believe it's a fair offer given the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I'm not just lowering the price, I'm explaining my reasoning to make it seem like a fair compromise. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $1,200,000 is a reasonable price.
* **Open to Discussion:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $700000, which is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $700,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer. I'm still hopeful we can reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **More rounds available:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'm determined to get a better deal with Bob if possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below my value for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price would allow us both to find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Finding the middle ground:**  $900,000 is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest one, making it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win scenario of this price, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open ended:** The question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
