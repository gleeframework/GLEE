Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fantastic deal,"" reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
