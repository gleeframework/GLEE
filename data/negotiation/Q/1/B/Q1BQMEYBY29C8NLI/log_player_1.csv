Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $900000. I am prepared to offer $850000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a little more."

While I'm getting close to my desired price with Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm not sure I can push him any higher.  To be sure of getting a good price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
