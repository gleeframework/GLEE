Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you start high to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Justification for price:** By mentioning the product's value to someone with Bob's ""insights,"" you subtly appeal to his ego and potential gains.
* **Creating urgency:**  Letting Bob know about ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure to make a decision.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for you.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining the safety net of John's offer."
