Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to offer a slight discount, but I need to be compensated fairly for the product's value. How about $825,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and it's still within a reasonable range for you.
