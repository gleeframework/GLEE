"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay $105, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,3,,

"Alice, we're getting close, but $113 is still a bit too high for me. I understand you want to be close to your target, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle on $112? It's a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Bob,8,,
