"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's start with this number and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and analysis, and its market value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,100,000 is still too high for me.  I understand the product's potential, but my budget is firmly set at $800,000.  If you're serious about selling, I'm prepared to close the deal right now at that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor, but I need to be upfront â€“  $800,000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need to see a significant move on your end.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but that's my absolute best offer. This represents a substantial discount and I'm confident it's more than reasonable given the product's potential.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
