Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's start with this number and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and analysis, and its market value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, but I'm also keeping the option of buying from John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,100,000 is still too high for me.  I understand the product's potential, but my budget is firmly set at $800,000.  If you're serious about selling, I'm prepared to close the deal right now at that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept my final offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your candor, but I need to be upfront â€“  $800,000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need to see a significant move on your end.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but that's my absolute best offer. This represents a substantial discount and I'm confident it's more than reasonable given the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still far too high.  It's clear she's not willing to come down to my budget.  I've reached my limit, and I don't want to risk losing more time in negotiations.  I'm going to buy from John."
