"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  How about we settle at $850,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,
