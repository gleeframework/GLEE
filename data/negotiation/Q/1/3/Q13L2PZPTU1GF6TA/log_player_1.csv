Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 6

While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob has met my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure the deal now at $800,000 than risk him walking away in later rounds."
