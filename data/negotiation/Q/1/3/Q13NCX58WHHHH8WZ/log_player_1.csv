"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high with $15,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but also shows that I value the product highly.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I have a feeling Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to push for a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500 this time.  This is a significant move towards Bob's offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000 if I have to, but I'm going to try to get $12,500 and hopefully close the deal in this round."
