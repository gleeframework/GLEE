"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price ($1,500,000), making a counteroffer a worthwhile strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $1,100,000? I believe this is still a fair price given the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. This product offers tremendous value, and I need to see a price that reflects that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  There is still room for potential negotiation, but accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product and avoid further haggling or the risk of losing the product to another seller."
