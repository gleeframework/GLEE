"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a significant amount and would still allow you to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $850,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's closer to your perceived value and gives you a solid profit. Let's try to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
