Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because: 

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $100. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It leaves room for both of you to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you can try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? It's a fair price considering the value this product offers you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $107? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $107 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance he'll stick to his offer.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of him walking away or me getting stuck with the lower price from John."
