Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than his perceived value increases the chance of him accepting immediately.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob.

This offer attempts to find a sweet spot that is appealing to Bob but still highly profitable for me."
