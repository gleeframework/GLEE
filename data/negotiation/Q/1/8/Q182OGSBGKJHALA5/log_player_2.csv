"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice will accept a lower price, as her minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price.  This gives Bob a good starting point while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000, and it's significantly lower than what he'd pay John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending the negotiation is too high.  Accepting her offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without jeopardizing the deal."
