``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer.  It also shows confidence in the product's value while leaving space for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $7,500 is a better price than the minimum I am willing to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
