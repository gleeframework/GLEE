"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $9,750. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. This price is fair for both of us, and we can move forward.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about it for a moment... Okay, I'm willing to meet you at $9,800. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,7,
