# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it!

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **John is a fallback option:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still buy from John, but it's a less ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500 for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  It's above your preferred price range, and you're already seeing some movement from her. 
* **You're still not in a rush:**  You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate a better price.
* **John remains a fallback option:**  If the negotiations fail with Alice, you can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price:**  You've already rejected $10,000 in the first round, and there's no indication she's willing to budge further.
* **You're getting close to your limit:**  You have fewer rounds left and don't want to be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **There's still room for a better deal:** You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and you can try one more time to convince Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $9,750. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. This price is fair for both of us, and we can move forward."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about it for a moment... Okay, I'm willing to meet you at $9,800. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price:**  She's dropped to $9,800, which is just $250 more than your last counteroffer.
* **You're running out of time:** You have only 3 rounds left, and you risk having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **It's a good deal:** While not ideal, $9,800 is still a good price for you. You're getting the product for significantly less than what you would pay John.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer in this round is the best option to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price without running out of time."
