"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
