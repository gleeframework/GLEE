"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
