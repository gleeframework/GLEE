"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, or you can stick with your backup plan of buying from John for a much better price."
