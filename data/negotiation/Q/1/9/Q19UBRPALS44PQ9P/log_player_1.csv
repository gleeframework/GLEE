Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 14,000?**  I'm aiming for the best possible deal while still ensuring Bob is likely to accept. 
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation of $10,000, giving him a good deal.
    * It's lower than my fallback price of $15,000 with John, meaning I'm still making a profit. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy is based on the following assumptions:

* **Bob is rational:** He will make a decision based on what's financially advantageous for him.
* **Bob wants the product:** Since he values it at $10,000, he's likely willing to pay something to acquire it.

By offering a price slightly below my fallback price, I increase the odds of Bob accepting while still maximizing my potential earnings."
