"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is well above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's no reason to accept it. Rejecting and counter-offering allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your preferred budget. You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's worth trying to push for a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows for a win-win for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now firm on $1,400,000, which is still higher than your comfortable limit. You've already made two counteroffers, and there's a good chance that further negotiation will not yield a better price. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
