"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that's still within your range, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,250. I really think this is a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
