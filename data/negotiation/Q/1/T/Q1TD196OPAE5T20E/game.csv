"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $2,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts on that?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand that $2,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.
