Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $2,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer $1,850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While getting the full $2,000,000 would be ideal, Bob seems firmly set in his pricing. Accepting his offer of $1,850,000 is a significant profit over John's offer of $1,500,000.  Continuing to push at this point might irritate Bob and risk losing the deal entirely."
