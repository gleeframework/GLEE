"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still just a bit too far out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but the highest I can go right now is $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $17,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",17000.0,Alice,5,
