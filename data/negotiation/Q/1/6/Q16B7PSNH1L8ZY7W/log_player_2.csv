# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with her. There's a chance we can reach a deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to my target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still just a bit too far out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but the highest I can go right now is $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $17,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $17,000 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  I've reached a point where it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John for my target price of $12,000.  I've already spent several rounds negotiating and don't want to risk losing the deal with John."
