"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $1,200,000}

I'm starting with a price that is slightly lower than the product's value to me, but still above its value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher profit."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000 but closer to the product's value to Bob. This should give Bob an incentive to make another offer, and I'll be able to gauge how much he's willing to pay."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $1,100,000}
