{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 at this point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet at $125. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $117.50. It's a fair compromise that's closer to both our desired prices."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
