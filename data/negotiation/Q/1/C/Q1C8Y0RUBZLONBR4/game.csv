"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think!",17500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to see if we can reach an agreement. This still allows me to cover my costs and leaves room for profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it for $12,750.  This gives us both a good deal and avoids having to go through more rounds of negotiation. What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, let's try to wrap this up quickly. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that.",12000.0,Bob,6,
