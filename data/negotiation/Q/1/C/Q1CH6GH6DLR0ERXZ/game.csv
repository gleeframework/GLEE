"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $135. It's a fair price considering the product's value.,135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Can you consider $132? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $132. I've already made a significant concession, and I think $135 is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm willing to walk away and sell the product to someone else.",135.0,Alice,7,
