Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I'm still at my limit of $8,500.  That's my best offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. There's still a bit of room for negotiation, and I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still a bit away from mine.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That would be a fair compromise, and it would be a great price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
