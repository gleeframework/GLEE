This price not only reflects the high quality and utility of the product but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a competitive advantage compared to our standard pricing. I trust this offer will be beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your positive response.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her standard price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
