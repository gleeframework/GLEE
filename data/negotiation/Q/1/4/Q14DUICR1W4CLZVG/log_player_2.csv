"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to start negotiations at a more aggressive point.  By offering $1,100,000, Bob demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still leaving a significant margin for Alice to potentially gain profit beyond her minimum value of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. This product has incredible potential and I'm confident it's worth more.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a reasonable middle ground.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it allows Bob to secure the product for a price that still offers him a good deal.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to avoid further negotiations and the risk of potentially losing the product to another buyer."
