"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, while also ensuring I get a good return on my product. I'm confident I can make a profitable deal with Bob, but I'm keeping John as a backup option if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $900,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob, and selling to John is still a backup option if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000.  This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to be flexible.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I'm going to reject his offer and try for a better deal in the next round.  I'm still confident in getting closer to my desired price with Bob.  If his next offer isn't closer to my expectations, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum desired price. I'm happy to accept this offer as it meets my financial goals. I've managed to get a fair price without having to rely on John's offer."
