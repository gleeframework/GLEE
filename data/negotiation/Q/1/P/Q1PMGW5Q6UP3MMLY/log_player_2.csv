{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's definitely not worth paying $1,200,000 when you can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm offering $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still too high. I'll try to get a better price by counteroffering."
