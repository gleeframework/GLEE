{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, considering my budget and the value I perceive in the product, I am willing to pay up to $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to sell for that amount just yet. I believe I can get a higher price, especially since I have multiple rounds to negotiate.  I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me, which is $8,000.  This gives me a clear benchmark for how low I'm willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,750?  This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going slightly higher than Bob's offer with this counteroffer. This shows him I'm still aiming for a good price but I'm also willing to compromise a bit. I'm also emphasizing the ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to highlight that this price is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I am willing to pay $9600 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm confident I can still get a better deal. I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me, which is $8,000, so I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly lower than that."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! Let's split the difference. How about $9,650? I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9650}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with this counteroffer.  I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price but I'm also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I'm emphasizing the ""fair"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept and ensure a positive outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  We're getting very close to my desired price, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for $9,550 just yet, especially since I still have a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $9,600. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing I'm flexible but also demonstrating that I'm not going to go much lower.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $8,000. We're reaching a point where the negotiations with Bob aren't getting us any closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the sale with John and get at least $8,000 than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having the negotiation stall out completely."
