"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to secure the product at a price that aligns with your investment goals. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant step toward your asking price. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value of the product, while also acknowledging your investment goals.
