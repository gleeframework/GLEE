"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned it has.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it still offers you a great deal. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000 is a good starting point, but I can go up to $1,080,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,080,000 is still a bit below what I believe this product is truly worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to go down to $1,090,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a reasonable cost and allowing me to secure a good return on my investment.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
