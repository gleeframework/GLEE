"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially earn more while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $10,000, which is close to my counteroffer.  This is a good deal for me, considering John is only offering $8,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
