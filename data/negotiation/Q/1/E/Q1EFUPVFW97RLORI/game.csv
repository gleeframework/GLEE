"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,000? That's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,4,
