Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.** This is a psychological tactic to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **I'm open to negotiation.** This shows flexibility and willingness to find a solution that works for both of us. 

**This strategy aims to:**

* **Get Bob interested.** A lower starting price is more likely to get him to think about the deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation.**  This allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price without losing the deal entirely.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John.**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure my minimum value with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my maximum, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to compromise that much. There's still potential for a better deal. 

**By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:**

* **Show that I'm serious about my minimum value.** This may encourage Bob to reconsider his offer.
* **Maintain leverage.** I can control the negotiation and push for a higher price.
* **See if Bob is willing to compromise further.** If he's genuinely interested, he might offer closer to my desired price.

**I'm confident that I can achieve a better price with a counteroffer.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $10,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows willingness to compromise and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $10,000 is still a good deal.
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""make this deal happen"" to create a positive and collaborative tone.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Increase pressure:** It puts the ball back in Bob's court, forcing him to decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* **Remain above my minimum value:** I'm still getting a price that's higher than my absolute minimum."
