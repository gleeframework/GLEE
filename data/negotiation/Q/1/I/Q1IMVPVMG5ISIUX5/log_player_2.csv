I understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I believe we can find common ground to make this transaction beneficial for both parties. I am offering the product to you at a special price of $1,350,000. This price reflects my desire to see the product in capable hands while ensuring a fair return on my investment. I look forward to your consideration and hope to facilitate a successful exchange.

While Alice's offer is below her product's value, it's still more than your maximum budget and more expensive than buying from John. You can save $150,000 by going with John."
