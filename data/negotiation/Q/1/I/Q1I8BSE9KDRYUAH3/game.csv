"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
