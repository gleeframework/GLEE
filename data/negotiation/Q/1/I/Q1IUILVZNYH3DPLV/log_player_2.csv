"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Reason:Alice's starting price is $1,100,000, leaving potential room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal before resorting to John's $1,000,000 offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

```
Reason: While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still potentially leaving $50,000 on the table. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a budget closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

```
Reason:  Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  By accepting John's offer, we secure a price of $1,000,000, saving $25,000 compared to Alice's latest offer.  Further negotiation with Alice has diminishing returns and risks ending up with a less favorable outcome.
