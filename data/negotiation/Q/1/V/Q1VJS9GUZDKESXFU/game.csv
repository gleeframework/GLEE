"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I think it's a fair offer, considering its value to the right buyer.",900000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775000.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $825000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about buying the product. I'm thinking of a price of $815000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to the end of my patience, Bob. I've made several concessions already, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more effort to reach a deal. I'm thinking of a price of $810000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll sell the product to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",810000.0,Alice,9,
