``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Bob some room to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $12,000, but still above Bob's offer of $9,000.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to meet me halfway."
