"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I need to stick to my budget. I am now willing to consider $1,050,000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this is within your range.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
