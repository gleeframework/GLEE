"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $400,000 is a very good price, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower. There's a lot of room for negotiation before reaching the $1,500,000 price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A price of $250,000 is a big drop from $400,000, but it's still a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer.  This will help determine if Alice is serious about selling and how flexible she is on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** $350,000 is still a good price, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further. There's still a significant difference between $350,000 and my maximum price of $1,500,000.  I'll try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown some flexibility by coming down from $400,000 to $350,000.  I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $300,000, which is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers. This will hopefully encourage Alice to accept or at least to come closer to my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $325,000, which is close to my last counteroffer of $300,000.  It's a good price, and I'm confident I can't get it much lower.  It's also a significant savings compared to the $1,500,000 from John. Accepting this offer is the best way to save money and get the product."
