"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I could come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a lower price point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
