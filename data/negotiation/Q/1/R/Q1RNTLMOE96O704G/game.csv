"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $850,000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
