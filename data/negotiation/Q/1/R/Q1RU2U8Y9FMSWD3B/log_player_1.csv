Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  You can always decrease your asking price, but you can't increase it once an offer is made.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, aiming high with Bob increases the potential for a significantly higher profit."
