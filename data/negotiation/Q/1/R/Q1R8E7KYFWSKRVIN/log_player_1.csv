Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,500, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,500. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is pretty good.  I don't want to risk losing this deal completely, so I'll accept his offer."
