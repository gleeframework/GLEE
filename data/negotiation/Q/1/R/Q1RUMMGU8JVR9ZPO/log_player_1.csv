"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make him consider the offer seriously.
* **Setting the tone:** My message is friendly and enthusiastic, aiming to build a positive negotiation atmosphere. 

This initial offer allows me to assess Bob's interest and see how he reacts.  It's important to remember that I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's start from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can close the gap.  I'm still not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe there's more potential with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still offers you a substantial profit, and it gives me the opportunity to get a fair return on my investment. Let's reach an agreement now."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a compromise.  
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will still get at this price, highlighting the potential profit for him.
* **Time sensitivity:** I'm suggesting a deal now to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept. 

This counteroffer is a significant step towards meeting Bob's expectations, but it still allows me to get closer to my desired price.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still unwilling to budge much. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'm going to counteroffer again, but this time I'll be more firm in my price and reiterate the value of the product to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply wouldn't cover my investment in this product.  This isn't just any product, it has unique features that are extremely valuable to you and would generate significant revenue. I'm prepared to go down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and both benefit from the incredible value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm using the term ""final offer"" to create pressure and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Stronger stance:** I'm standing firm on my price,  showing that I'm not willing to go lower.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $900,000 is still below my target. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, but if this offer is rejected, I will sell to John.  The risk of losing the deal to another buyer should encourage Bob to make a final concession."
