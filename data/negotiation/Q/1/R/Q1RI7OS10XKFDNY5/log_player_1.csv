Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to stay within my budget.
