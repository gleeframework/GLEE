"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, and I believe $925,000 would be a good compromise.  It's a significant reduction from your previous offer, but still a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $937,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",937500.0,Alice,5,
