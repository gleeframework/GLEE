"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its potential value to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. ",940000.0,Alice,5,
