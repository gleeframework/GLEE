"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its potential value to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is too high. It's worth exploring if a better deal can be reached.  There are 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still has 7 more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price. There's potential to squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $940,000. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,000,000.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and eventually reaching a price higher than $940,000 is real.  With only 5 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
