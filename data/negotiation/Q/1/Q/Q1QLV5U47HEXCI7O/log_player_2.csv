"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I propose we strike a deal that benefits both of us. Would you like to purchase it for $120? This way, you save $30 compared to my initial valuation, while I receive more than its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John accomplishes that."
