"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to her value for the product, we are still aiming to pay less than $8,000. We have time to negotiate further, and Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice.  I appreciate the effort. How about we settle on $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  We're raising our offer from $6,500 to $7,000, demonstrating our willingness to move towards Alice's price.  
* **Justification:** We provide a reason for our counteroffer, suggesting that $7,000 represents a balanced compromise where both parties benefit.
* **Time Consideration:** We still have plenty of rounds left, so we don't need to rush to Alice's $8,000 price just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $7,000, but I can do a bit better than that. How about $7,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Alice moving down to $7,500 indicates we might be able to push for a slightly better deal. We're aiming for the best possible price within our $10,000 limit. We'll try one more counteroffer before considering accepting."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  I'm willing to meet you at $7,250.  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're offering a price directly in between our previous offer ($7,000) and Alice's current offer ($7,500). 
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating it's our final offer, we signal that we're serious and unlikely to move much higher. This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk the deal falling through.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're nearing the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. We need to apply some pressure while still leaving room for Alice to make a small profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $7,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think we're close, though! Let's meet at $7,000 and call it a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our previous counteroffer of $7,000.  This is a great price, well below our $10,000 maximum and a significant saving compared to John's offer.  It's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate further down, and there's no guarantee a better offer will come. Accepting now secures a good deal!"
