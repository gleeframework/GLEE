"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum ($150), but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good starting point. It also expresses confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to do $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'll counter with a slightly higher price.  There's still time to negotiate before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives you a good price while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $128.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach an agreement. There are still several rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $129. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 129}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. How about $127?  That's the most I can offer without going over budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, I need to be realistic. If Bob continues to push for a lower price, I'll be forced to accept an offer that's too low. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price."
