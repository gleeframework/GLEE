Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to reach out.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, it's still too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still very interested in the product but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $9,000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  $9,000 is a fair compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
