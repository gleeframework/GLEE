"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it at $125. This means there's room for negotiation.  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best first move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is still a decent profit for Alice (given her valuation of $100) but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving some room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than my desired price. It's better than her initial offer of $125, but I want to see if I can push her further down. I'm still within the 10 rounds, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to $115. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, while still staying within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I will consider my options, as I am getting closer to my upper limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price above my desired range.  While I'm nearing my 10 round limit, I'm still willing to try one more counteroffer.  It's likely Alice is starting to feel the pressure of losing the sale, so this might be the point where she's more open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $120. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but it's still within my budget.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to find a price that both of us can agree on. If Alice rejects this offer, I will seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting closer to John's price, and I only have 3 rounds left.  I've made multiple counteroffers, and Alice has been stubborn. It's becoming clear that she's unlikely to go lower than $140.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to ensure I get the product within my budget."
