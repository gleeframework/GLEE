"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows room for negotiation and leaves space for potential concessions.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest level and understand his perceived value of the product. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail or stall. This provides a safety net and limits my risk."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Rejection:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer to demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to hold out for a price closer to my initial ask. 
* **Counter-Offer Next:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to a mutually acceptable price."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeated his offer of $1,200,000. This suggests he might be unwilling to go higher.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit.  However, I'm still hoping to maximize my earnings.
* **Prolonging the Negotiation:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating. I'm hoping to push him higher with another counteroffer.  I'm willing to take a small risk here to potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

* **Slight Concessions:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a respectable profit margin.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer aims to test Bob's upper limit. I believe he might be willing to go slightly higher to reach a deal. 
* **Limited Time:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and it's crucial to make progress. This counteroffer signals a sense of urgency."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $250,000 below my initial asking price. This is within my acceptable range and offers a reasonable profit.
* **Time Constraint:** We are now in round 6 out of 10.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and losing the opportunity to close the deal with Bob.
* **Potential of Higher Offers:**  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee. Bob might be unwilling to go higher, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 

**Decision:** It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale for $1,250,000. This guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of getting stuck in a stalemate or losing the deal altogether."
