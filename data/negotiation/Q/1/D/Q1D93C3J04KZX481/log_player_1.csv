Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup (from your minimum of $120) is a common starting point in negotiations, and it's not excessive enough to scare Bob away immediately.
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting the ""value"" aims to justify the price and make Bob feel good about the potential purchase.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can always go down slightly in price, but remember, your minimum is $120 to ensure you don't lose money compared to selling to John."
