"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $102.50?,102.5,Bob,4,
