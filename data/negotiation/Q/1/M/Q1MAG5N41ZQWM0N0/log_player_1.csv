Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $10,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While knowing Bob's valuation is lower than yours, you aim for the highest possible price, your minimum acceptable value ($10,000).
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept even if it's slightly above his valuation.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** You don't want to engage in back-and-forth, as you have a guaranteed buyer at your desired price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup ensures you won't settle for less than your product's worth to you."
