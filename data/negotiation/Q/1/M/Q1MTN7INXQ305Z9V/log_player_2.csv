# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're proposing a price of $120 for it. This is a special offer tailored to your needs, considering its high worth to you at $150. We're confident you'll find this investment worthwhile. Please let us know if you have any questions or if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, it's still significantly higher than what you could get it for from John. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer might lead to a better counter-offer from Alice."
