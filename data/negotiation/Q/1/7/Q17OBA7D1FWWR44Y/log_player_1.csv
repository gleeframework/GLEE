Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum, leaving me a decent profit, but it's also lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him a good deal. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also hints at the potential for a deal without directly mentioning the John option. 

By offering a competitive price and framing the deal in a positive light, I increase the chances of Bob accepting my offer and maximizing my profits."
