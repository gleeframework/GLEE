"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident in the value this product brings, so I'm proposing a price of $1,110,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1110000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,110,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise considering my initial offer. This is my final offer, and if you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to explore other options.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
