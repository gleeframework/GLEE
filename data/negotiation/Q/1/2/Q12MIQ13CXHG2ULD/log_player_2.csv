# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You have room to go lower than her offer, and still get a good deal."

Alice has moved a little bit closer to your counteroffer. It's still worth trying to push for a lower price. You can likely get the product for less than $1,110,000."
