"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone like you, Bob. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to spend.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, a price that reflects its value while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm also willing to make a slight concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To make this deal work, I'm offering $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and my ability to invest, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, and I really want to make this deal happen. However, $1,000,000 is still beyond my limit. To reach a mutually agreeable solution, I'm offering $985,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",985000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still talking. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, but I need to stay above $985,000. I'll sell the product to you for $995,000.
