Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping this will trigger a counteroffer from Bob, giving me a better understanding of his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counter-offering at $120.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John for the same price, as I avoid the hassle of negotiating further."
