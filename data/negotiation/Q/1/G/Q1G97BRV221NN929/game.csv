"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? I believe this price reflects both the value it holds and our willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,275,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see your point, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't go as low as $1,275,000. My final offer is $1,300,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential this product holds for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,287,500. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my budget.",1287500.0,Bob,6,
