"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $1000000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I need you to consider my offer seriously. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1180000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1140000 and $1200000, which would be $1170000. I'm willing to accept your offer if you can throw in one more extra, such as a free consultation with an expert in the field.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1170000, but I'm not willing to throw in any more extras. I'm also starting to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $1000000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $1200000, but if not, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
