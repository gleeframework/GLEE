"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far higher than your maximum budget of $80. There's no reason to accept it at this point.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $80.  This is a strong opening offer, as it's clear I'm not willing to pay more. It puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or counter with a price closer to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get Alice closer to my target price of $80. There's still room for negotiation and I have rounds left to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $90. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but still firmly within my budget.  It's a reasonable middle ground and hopefully enough to entice Alice to accept, considering her product's worth is $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my preferred price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate, as I have time left and there's a chance I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again increasing my offer slightly, but still staying within my budget.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $95 might be a sweet spot for her considering her product's value.  It also shows her that I'm serious about wanting to buy the product, but not at an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $98 is very close to my preferred price of $95. At this point,  it's not worth risking further negotiation.  There are only a few rounds left, and I could end up paying more if I keep rejecting.  Additionally, buying from John at $80 is still an option if I reject, so I'm in a good position to accept this offer and close the deal."
