I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below John's offer, leaving room for negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm reducing my price from the first round, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $120. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a better price in the next round.  There's still a good chance I can get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price point, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit lower than I'd like to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate, as I still have several rounds left and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can convince Bob to accept this price.  I only have a few rounds left, so I want to make sure I'm not losing out on a good deal."
