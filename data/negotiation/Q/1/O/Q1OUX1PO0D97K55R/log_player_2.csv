{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her minimum value, and Bob has room to push for a lower price.  There's a chance she might come down further to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is the minimum price Alice would accept.  It's likely that Alice will accept as she will still make a profit. If she rejects, Bob can then proceed to buy from John without losing money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is just above her minimum value of $1,200,000. It's a good deal for Bob considering he can buy from John for $1,500,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
