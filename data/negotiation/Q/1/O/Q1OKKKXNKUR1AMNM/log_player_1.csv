"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit above my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I need to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this encourages Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum,  I'm not willing to give up so much profit just yet. I'll counteroffer one more time before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum price. This is a good deal for me and it's worth finalizing the sale instead of risking another round of counteroffers."
