"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has immense value for your business. My starting price is $1150000. This reflects the product's quality and potential. Let's discuss further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. Given the product's unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $950000, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your continued interest, $950000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a price closer to $1000000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
