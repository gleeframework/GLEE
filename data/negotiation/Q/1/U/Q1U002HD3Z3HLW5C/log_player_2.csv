"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $14,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:** Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. 
* **Time is on your side:** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting doesn't hurt you right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your maximum price ($15,000) and Alice's initial price ($14,000).
* **Reasonable:**  It's still a good deal for you, and Alice is likely to find it more appealing than her previous offer.
* **Early negotiation:** By making a strong counteroffer early, you show Alice you're serious about getting a good price and incentivize her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** Alice's offer is only $500 more than your last counteroffer.  It's within your budget and a good compromise.
* **Time is running out:**  You have 7 rounds left. While you could try to get a lower price,  it's not guaranteed, and you risk losing time and potentially missing out on a deal altogether.
* **Low risk:** Accepting this offer means you get the product for a price that is still very advantageous for you, with minimal risk of further negotiations."
