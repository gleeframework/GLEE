Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Time Value & Alternative Option:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000.  Securing a deal with Bob quickly, even if slightly lower than his maximum valuation, is preferable to potentially lengthy negotiations that might lead me back to John's offer."
