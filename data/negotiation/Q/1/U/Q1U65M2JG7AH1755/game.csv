"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is a compromise that should satisfy both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer. I can tell we're both motivated to get this deal done. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000 even? That seems like a fair and clean number we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. You know the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
