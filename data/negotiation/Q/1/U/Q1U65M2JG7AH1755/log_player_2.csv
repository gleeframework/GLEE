Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is a compromise that should satisfy both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. You know the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's made it clear that $1,075,000 is her final offer. She's holding firm because she knows the product has a higher value to you.
* **You're running out of rounds:** With only three rounds left, the chances of negotiating a significantly better price with Alice are slim.
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** While buying from John means you'll pay your maximum budget ($1,200,000), it eliminates the risk of the negotiation with Alice failing completely. 

At this point, the certainty of securing the product from John outweighs the potential (but unlikely) savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice."
