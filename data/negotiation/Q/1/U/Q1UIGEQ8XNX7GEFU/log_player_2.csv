"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice met you in the middle, which shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Significant Savings:**  $13,750 is a good price, saving you $1,250 compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and there's a risk Alice could become less flexible."
