"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special starting price of $20,000. I believe it offers tremendous value, even at this price point. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the quality and potential of this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $17,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $10,000 is still less than I'd like, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",14000.0,Alice,5,
