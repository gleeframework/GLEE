"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's potential returns, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget allows for $750,000. If you're willing to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's potential returns.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I respect that you're trying to find a fair price.  To be honest, $825,000 is a bit too much of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $775,000? I'm hoping we can finalize this soon.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000.
