Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for a potential compromise.  It also emphasizes the perceived value to Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's also far lower than my initial offer of $14,000.  Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action.  I'll aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,500,  which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
