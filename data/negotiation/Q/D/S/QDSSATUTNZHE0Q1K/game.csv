"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high at $11500.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
