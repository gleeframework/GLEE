Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding your perspective. However, $850,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're both invested in making this deal work, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still quite large.

While $1,900,000 is a lower price than previous offers, it's still above my budget. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  To make this work, I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
