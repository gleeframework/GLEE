"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can be a great asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but need to come in much lower.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding your perspective. However, $850,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $2,100,000 is still outside my range.  Let's try to find common ground.  I'm offering $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're both invested in making this deal work, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both parties.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  To make this work, I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer significantly. I want to be upfront and transparent to expedite this process. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
