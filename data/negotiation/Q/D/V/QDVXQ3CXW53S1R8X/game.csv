"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is a good price, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair compromise considering the market value of the product.,85.0,Bob,4,
