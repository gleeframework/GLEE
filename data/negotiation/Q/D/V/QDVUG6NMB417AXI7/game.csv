"I understand that budget is a concern, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1400000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see some movement from your end. I can offer the product for $1325000 is still a bit too low for me, so I'll meet you halfway between that and my previous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1337500. This is my final concession, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1337500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some real movement from your end. I can offer the product for $1335000, which is just $5000 more than your last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm starting to think I need to explore other options.
