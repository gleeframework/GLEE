"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price given my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is below what I had in mind, I recognize your interest. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and still reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
