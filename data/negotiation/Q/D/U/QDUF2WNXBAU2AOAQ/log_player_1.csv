Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the current market. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You earn $150,000 more than selling to John.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chances of a successful sale above your minimum price."
