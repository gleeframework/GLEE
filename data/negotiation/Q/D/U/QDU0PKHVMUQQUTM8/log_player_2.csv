"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and should try to negotiate closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $9,500, he's getting a good deal that is well within his budget and still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's unlikely he'll be able to get a much lower price, and buying from John would be significantly more expensive."
