"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,
