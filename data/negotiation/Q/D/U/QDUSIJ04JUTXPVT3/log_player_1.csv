I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to try to get closer to that by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price point. Hopefully, this will convince him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my last offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and lead to a deal."
