Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,950 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final offer: $11,250. This is my absolute last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice seems firmly planted above $11,000. While we might squeeze out a tiny bit more in the last round, it's unlikely to be worth the risk. John's $15,000 offer is expensive, but guarantees we get the product and avoids a total negotiation failure with Alice."
