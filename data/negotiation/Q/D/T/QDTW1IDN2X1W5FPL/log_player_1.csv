Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and open to negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving enough room for Bob to counteroffer without risking a complete rejection. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have leverage because I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum. This allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations.
* **Counteroffer Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target, potentially closing the gap and reaching a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $1,350,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's roughly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to compromise while still protecting my value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and reiterating the ""great deal"" aspect to emphasize the potential for mutual benefit.
* **Open-Ended Tone:** The message ends with an open-ended question (""Let's see if we can find common ground here"") to encourage further discussion and a possible agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is only $200,000 below my minimum value of $1,500,000. This is a significant gain, considering my starting point of $1,400,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a complete breakdown in talks.  There's no guarantee I'll get closer to my desired price with another round.
* **Time Factor:**  While $1,300,000 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.  Accepting avoids the time and effort of further negotiation, and I'm guaranteed a sale above Bob's initial offer."
