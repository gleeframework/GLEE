"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:**  $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of rejection:** Further counteroffers risk Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
