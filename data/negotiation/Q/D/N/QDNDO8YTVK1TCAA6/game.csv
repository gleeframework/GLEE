"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product holds for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm genuinely interested in acquiring it.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
