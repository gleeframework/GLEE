"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still attractive to Bob since it's below his value. This allows for some negotiation space while ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $110. This shows flexibility to Bob, and hopefully he will counter with a higher price, allowing us to reach a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a little below my initial price, I've only got 6 rounds left and we're getting closer to an agreement. I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
