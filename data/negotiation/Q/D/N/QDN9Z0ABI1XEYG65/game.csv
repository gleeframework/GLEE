"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value, $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
