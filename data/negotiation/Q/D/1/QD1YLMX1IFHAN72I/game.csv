"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8750 is still a bit low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $9250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
