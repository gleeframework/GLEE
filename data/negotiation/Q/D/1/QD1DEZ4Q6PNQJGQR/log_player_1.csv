Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also highlights the value for Bob, making him more likely to accept."
