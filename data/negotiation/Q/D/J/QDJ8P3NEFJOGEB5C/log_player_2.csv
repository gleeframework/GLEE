Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see the price closer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair reflection of its value and allows me to make this purchase."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  Buying from John guarantees the best price at $1,000,000."
