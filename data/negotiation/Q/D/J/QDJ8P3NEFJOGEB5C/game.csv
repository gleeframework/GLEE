"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  To make this work, I'd need to see the price closer to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair reflection of its value and allows me to make this purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
