"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the condition of the product, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's try to close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm proposing a final price of $120. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
