"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $18,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $15,000. This is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and John's offer. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. Buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
