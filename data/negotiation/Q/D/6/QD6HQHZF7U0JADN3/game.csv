"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. While I'd like to accommodate your request, the original asking price was based on the value of the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair value while making it more accessible to you.
