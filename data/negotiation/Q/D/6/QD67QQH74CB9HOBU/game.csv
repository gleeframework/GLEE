"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
