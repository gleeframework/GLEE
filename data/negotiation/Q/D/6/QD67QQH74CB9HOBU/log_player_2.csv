"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. It's closer to her valuation than yours. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target a price closer to your valuation:**  Starting at $10,500 aims closer to your $12,000 maximum while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Provide a justification:** Highlighting the mutual benefit (""good deal for both of us"") makes the offer more appealing. 
* **Polite and respectful tone:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice increases the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your ideal price. There's no point in rejecting and risking her raising the price again, or going with John who offers the same price.  This is a good deal!"
