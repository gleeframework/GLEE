Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you are willing to compromise. If Bob rejects the offer, you can then consider his counteroffer and adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $14,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that's still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value.  It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price. This approach helps maintain a positive negotiation dynamic and increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
