"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $110.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum price, you can try to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, you might prompt Alice to lower the price further. If she doesn't, you can always buy from John for $120."
