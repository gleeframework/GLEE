Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything lower.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, creating a potential surplus we can explore. 
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his $1,500,000 valuation) while maximizing your gain.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see value in.  Given its unique qualities, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  Keeps things positive, acknowledges Bob's interest, and positions the price as mutually beneficial.
* **The Price:**  Splits the difference between your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's valuation ($1,500,000).  This leaves both sides with a significant gain.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust, but always keep your $1,200,000 minimum in mind.
* **Other Factors:** This simplifies things. In reality, factors like your relationship with Bob, your risk tolerance, and potential future deals could influence your strategy."
