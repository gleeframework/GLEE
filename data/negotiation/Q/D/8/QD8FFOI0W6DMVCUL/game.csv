"Bob, I have a product that I believe could be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential benefits will outweigh the cost.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
