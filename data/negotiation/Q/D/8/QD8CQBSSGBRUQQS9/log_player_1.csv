Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my target value by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been insistent on $11,000, and I've already moved down significantly from my initial offer.  I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
