"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Since Alice's offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no benefit to accepting it immediately.  Rejecting allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so offering slightly more than that ($10,500) is a reasonable starting point. It leaves room for negotiation and potentially gets a better deal than buying from John for $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000, and closer to the value of the product to Alice.  While further negotiation could potentially lower the price more, accepting this offer is the best choice to ensure Bob gets the product while still saving money."
