This is a high starting point, reflecting the product's significant value to me. However, it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be flexible to potentially maximize my earnings, but I will also be prepared to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the true value of the product to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm willing to lower my price, but not to the extent Bob is proposing.  $1,250,000 is still a considerable profit for me, while also being a fair price for Bob, considering he has already shown a willingness to pay. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while leaving me with a comfortable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting significantly lower. While it's still possible to negotiate further, the risk of continuing is high.  His offers are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  To ensure I get a reasonable price, I'll choose to sell to John for $1,000,000."
