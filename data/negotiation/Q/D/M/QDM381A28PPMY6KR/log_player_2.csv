Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get a good deal.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer,  but still within the realm of possibility given my maximum budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better price. I'm still under my budget with John, so I'm not in a rush to make a deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down in price, but it's still too high.  I'm increasing my counteroffer to $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm still trying to get a better price. It's also within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer again.  I'm still under my budget with John, so I have some room to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm getting closer to Alice's offer, but I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,050,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm still trying to get a better price.  This is also within my budget, and if Alice accepts, it's a good deal for me."
