"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but realistic:** I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit. 
* **No immediate need for John:** I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, as I don't know his value for the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential counteroffers and a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately. 
* **More rounds available:**  I have more rounds to explore better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profit. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's interest at a price closer to my minimum, without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a little too low. I'm hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** We are getting into the later rounds, so I need to be cautious. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm not convinced Bob won't go higher, so I'm going to try for one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm going lower again to try and meet Bob halfway, but this is a significant compromise on my end.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I'm hoping to secure a profitable deal, but I'm also aware that we are nearing the halfway point of the rounds, and selling to John is becoming a more viable option.
* **Pressuring Bob:** This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about closing a deal, while also putting pressure on Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, guaranteeing a profit.
* **Limited rounds:** We are halfway through the negotiation process, and each round brings us closer to the point where I might have to sell to John for the lower price.
* **No guarantee of a better deal:** There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by continuing to negotiate. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price from John."
