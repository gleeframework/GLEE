Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer is a great value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above that. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows Alice to be a bit more firm in her offer to Bob. 

By offering the product at $14,500, Alice leaves room for some negotiation downward, but still positions herself to gain a significant profit above Bob's perceived value."
