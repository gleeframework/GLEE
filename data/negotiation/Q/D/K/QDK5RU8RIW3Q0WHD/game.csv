"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This would still provide you with a healthy profit margin, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I believe we can both live with.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow me to finalize this purchase.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This is a final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
