"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price closer to his maximum value of $120. He's offering $105, which is still a good profit for Alice (since her value is $100), but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm aiming for a bit more than that. Could you do $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $115 to $110, which is a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will hold firm or even increase the price again.  At $110, Bob is still getting a good deal and saving $10 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation isn't worth the potential loss of a good price."
