Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches what John is willing to pay. While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee of reaching a higher price. Accepting John's offer guarantees us the maximum value for the product without further risk of negotiation."
