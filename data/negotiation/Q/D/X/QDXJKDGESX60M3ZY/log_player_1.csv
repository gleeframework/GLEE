{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $125? It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $122.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and I'm happy to accept it. I'm not going to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price."
