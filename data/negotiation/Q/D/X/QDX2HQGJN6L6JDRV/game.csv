"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet in that range?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true worth.
