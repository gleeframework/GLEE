You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $9,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate further.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower before committing to the purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 5% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but it's still within a range I'm comfortable with.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  There's room for further negotiation, and I'm not ready to commit yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer slightly, but still below Alice's latest price.  This shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to a price that's within my acceptable range.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John, or Alice becoming less flexible, is too high.  $8,700 is a good deal and it's time to secure the purchase."
