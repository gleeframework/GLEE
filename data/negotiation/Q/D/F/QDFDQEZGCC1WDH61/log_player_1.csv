"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable insight into his perception of the product's value and his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** I am aware of John's standing offer, which serves as a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob are not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above my absolute minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to engage in further rounds to try and secure a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's offer while standing firm on the product's value.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Moving to $1,400,000 signals a willingness to negotiate but still maintains a significant profit margin. 
* **Time Consideration:** With each round, the opportunity cost of John's offer becomes more relevant. We need to make progress quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I believe the product is worth more, the negotiation progress is slowing. Accepting $1,350,000 provides a healthy profit of $150,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing both Bob and John as potential buyers. John's offer of $1,200,000 is becoming more appealing as time passes.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Securing the sale now at $1,350,000 eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation and guarantees a substantial return."
