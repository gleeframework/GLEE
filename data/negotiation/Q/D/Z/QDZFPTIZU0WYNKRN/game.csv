"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our unique product to you. It holds significant value for us at $1,500,000. We believe it could be a valuable asset for you as well. Let's discuss how we can make this opportunity work for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. We've invested considerable resources into developing this product, and we believe its true value lies closer to $1,500,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground that respects both our needs?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, and I'd like to propose an offer that respects both our interests. How about $1,200,000? This allows us to maintain a fair value for our product while making it more accessible to you. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can both walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I respect your offer. However, after careful consideration, I would like to suggest a compromise at $1,150,000. This reflects a fair valuation for our product while allowing you to acquire it within your budget. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
