"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is good, but not quite *that* good. How about we bring it down closer to reality?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I still think we have some ground to cover.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one, say $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
