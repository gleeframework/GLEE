Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is good, but not quite *that* good. How about we bring it down closer to reality? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
