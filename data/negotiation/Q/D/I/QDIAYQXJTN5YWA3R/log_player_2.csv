"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,300,000, which is still higher than her value of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my value for this product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is still higher than her value of $1,200,000, but it's a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's still favorable for me."
