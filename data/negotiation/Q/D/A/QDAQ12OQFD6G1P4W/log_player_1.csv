Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This offer still allows for a good return on my investment, while providing you with a fair price for the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm getting close to considering buying from John if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price.  While I'd love to push for more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at the same price.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
