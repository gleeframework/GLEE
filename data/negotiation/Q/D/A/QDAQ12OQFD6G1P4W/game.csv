This reflects the value I see in the product and its potential benefits for you. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This offer still allows for a good return on my investment, while providing you with a fair price for the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm getting close to considering buying from John if we can't meet on this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
