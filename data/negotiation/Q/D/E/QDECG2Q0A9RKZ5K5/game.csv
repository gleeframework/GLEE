"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, based on my current budget and valuation of the product, I am unable to meet your asking price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your position and respect the value of your product. However, given my current financial situation and the market value of similar products, I believe $925,000 is still slightly above my maximum acceptable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 again. I hope this renewed offer will be considered seriously and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
