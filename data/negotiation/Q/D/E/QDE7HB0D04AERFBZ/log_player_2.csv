# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to hold out for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target price, Bob still has room to negotiate and get a better deal. He can try to get Alice down to his initial counteroffer of $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could continue negotiating, Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's only $1,000 more than his ideal price.  Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, and then he'd have to pay John $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best outcome for Bob."
