"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to hold out for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
