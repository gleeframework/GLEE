{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's value of $10,000, leaving room for potential negotiation while still securing a profit for me. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to sell at such a huge discount. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my final offer.  This price still represents a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your desired value, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $11,000, Bob's offer of $10,250 is closer to my desired value and  a better deal than selling to John for $12,000.  It's also a good compromise, showing that we both are willing to meet in the middle."
