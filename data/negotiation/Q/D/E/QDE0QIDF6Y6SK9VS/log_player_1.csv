Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it much higher at $1,200,000.  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fantastic deal"" to nudge Bob towards acceptance.

By setting the initial offer at $1,100,000, we aim to secure a significant profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
