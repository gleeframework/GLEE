"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer of $850,000, showing that you are willing to negotiate. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $950,000. This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000. At this point, the negotiation process seems to be stalling, and further counteroffers might not lead to a significantly better price. It's more efficient and time-saving to buy from John, even though it's slightly more expensive, ensuring a quick transaction."
