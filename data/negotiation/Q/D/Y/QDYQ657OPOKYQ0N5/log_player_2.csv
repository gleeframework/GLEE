"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $8,000, so anything less than that is a good deal. Alice's initial offer is already below your maximum, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, offering $7,000 is a reasonable starting point. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,200 is still a good deal, as you can get the product for $8,000 from John. There are still rounds left to negotiate, but accepting the offer now secures a lower price without risking the possibility of a higher price later."
