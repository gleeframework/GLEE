"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time.  I'm confident this price reflects the value I'll get from it. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to me while staying within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll get from the product, and it's closer to my original asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
