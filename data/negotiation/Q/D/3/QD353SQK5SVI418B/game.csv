"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a good deal for you as well. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good value for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to come down to this price, I may have to look elsewhere for this product.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to compromise. $8900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8700.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a good deal for you as well.  Let's close this deal and make this happen!",8700.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8800. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8800.0,Alice,9,
