{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for something worth a lot more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to get a quick sale.  But I'm also leaving room to negotiate if needed.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? It's a fair price considering what this product is worth. "", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum.  While I'd like to make a deal, I'm not willing to go lower than $100.  I'll take John's offer instead."
