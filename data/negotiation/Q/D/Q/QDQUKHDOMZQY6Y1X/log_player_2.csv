"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000.  It's a significant value proposition, and I believe it's a price point that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This gives you a significant discount and ensures I can still cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to cover your costs, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $850,000?  This would be a significant saving for you, and still allows me to reach my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go below $800,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at that price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can secure your desired price elsewhere."
