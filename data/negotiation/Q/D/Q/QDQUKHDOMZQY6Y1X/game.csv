"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000.  It's a significant value proposition, and I believe it's a price point that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This gives you a significant discount and ensures I can still cover my costs.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to cover your costs, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $850,000?  This would be a significant saving for you, and still allows me to reach my target price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
