"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's lower than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage him to negotiate without being immediately put off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $90 is still below what I consider fair. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
