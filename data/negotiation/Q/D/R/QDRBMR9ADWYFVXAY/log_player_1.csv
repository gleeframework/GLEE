Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob $9,000. This is a bit higher than my minimum, giving him some room to negotiate. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500.  This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and while I could counteroffer again, it's getting a bit risky. I don't want to keep going back and forth and potentially end up with nothing. John is a guaranteed $8,000, so I'm going to sell to him."
