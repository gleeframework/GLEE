Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher initially allows me to potentially gain an extra $5,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down.  Even if he negotiates, I'm likely to still secure a price higher than my guaranteed $10,000.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response to this initial offer will give me insight into his perception of the product's value and how motivated he is to buy."
