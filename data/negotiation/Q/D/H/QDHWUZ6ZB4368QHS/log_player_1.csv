"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  It's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, so I hope you'll consider it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation and sets a strong initial position.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value for Bob creates a sense of urgency and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Discount:**  Mentioning a discount from my own perspective makes the price seem more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** 
* **There are still rounds remaining:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $14,000 is a good offer, it's just a little below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price that is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintain Value:**  I still emphasize the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that it's a good deal.
* **Urgency:**  I create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm happy to sell the product to Bob for $15,000, as it meets my minimum requirements.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next rounds.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** While I could sell to John for the same price, I prefer to close the deal with Bob if possible.

I've accepted Bob's offer, and we've closed the deal!"
