Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  This is my best price, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $11000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $11000, so I'll offer you $12000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $12,000 is at your maximum price point.  While you could potentially continue negotiating and maybe get a slightly better price, there's no guarantee. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for the best price you're willing to pay, and avoids the risk of the negotiations failing. You also have the option to buy from John if you are unable to close the deal with Alice."
