"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in finding a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
