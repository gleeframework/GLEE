"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation. We started at a $3,000 difference and are now at a $2,000 difference.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a better price."

Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price represents a significant saving compared to John's offer. It's a good deal."
