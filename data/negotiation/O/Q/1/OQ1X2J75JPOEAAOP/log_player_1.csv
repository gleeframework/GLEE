"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high at $18,000, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit above my minimum of $12,000. I'm also trying to build rapport by stating my confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum price, which is fine, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal, and I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to suggest a price of $14000 for the product. I hope this is within your range of consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum and provides a decent profit.  We're nearing the middle of the rounds, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price with further negotiations. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing a deal with Bob and then needing to settle with John for my minimum price."
