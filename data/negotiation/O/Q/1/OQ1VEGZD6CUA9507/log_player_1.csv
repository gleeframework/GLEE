"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's maximum value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a decent profit.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer in the next round.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my target while still showing flexibility. By splitting the difference, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise. I'm also reminding Bob that we both stand to benefit from a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $95 is a fair price for me, considering the product is worth $80 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my target than selling to John. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm starting to run out of time. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
