Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer represents a significant discount for Bob, making it tempting for him to accept. However, it still leaves me with a profit of $800,000, which is a good return considering the alternative of selling to John for $1,200,000. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while leaving room for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome, as Bob's counteroffers are consistently lower than my desired price.  Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, securing the best possible outcome for me."
