"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's unlikely she's truly at her bottom price, and there's a chance I can get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and try to counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's definitely interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my interest in purchasing but also setting a firm lower bound.  It gives Alice space to negotiate while still leaving room for me to make further concessions if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I have to say, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, which is a good sign.  However, there's still some wiggle room.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a lower price in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price point of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to offer $825,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to show flexibility in my counteroffers, but also pushing for a lower price. Offering $825,000 splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This signals that I'm serious about buying the product but also want to ensure I get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $837500. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting closer to my desired price, but I still see room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to land somewhere between $825,000 and $837,500. I'm  getting closer to my ideal price and want to see if I can close the deal without resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. How about $830,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us. I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 830000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly higher than my previous counteroffer but lower than Alice's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway while still trying to save as much money as possible.  By saying I'm ready to close the deal at this price, I'm putting pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $830000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $825000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally matched my previous counteroffer of $825,000. This is a good price for me, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a lower price. It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of having to buy from John for a higher price."
