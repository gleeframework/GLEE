Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($100) as possible.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Offering it at $99 is slightly below your minimum but still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80). 
* **Urgency:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$100 or higher:** Bob would definitely reject this, knowing he can get it cheaper elsewhere.
* **$80-$90:** This would be a significant loss for you, especially since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100."
