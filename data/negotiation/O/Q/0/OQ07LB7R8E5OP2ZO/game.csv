"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my desired price point. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range, I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
