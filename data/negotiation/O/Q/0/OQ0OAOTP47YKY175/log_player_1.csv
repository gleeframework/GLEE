Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $850,000 is too low for what this product offers.  Would you consider $950,000? It's a price that reflects its true value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is already willing to pay a significant amount over our minimum. While we could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll lower his offer or walk away. Accepting $900,000 ensures a very profitable deal."
