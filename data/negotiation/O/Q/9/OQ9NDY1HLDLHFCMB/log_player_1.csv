Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counters.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $100, we can see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, we know he's interested but wants a better price. 
* **Safety Net:** We have John as a backup who will buy at our minimum price ($80), so there's no risk of losing money."
