"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
