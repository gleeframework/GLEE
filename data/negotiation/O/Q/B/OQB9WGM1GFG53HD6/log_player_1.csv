Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** This ensures that you're getting a better price than your fallback option of selling to John."
