"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000.  This still gives you a significant savings and allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer of $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?
