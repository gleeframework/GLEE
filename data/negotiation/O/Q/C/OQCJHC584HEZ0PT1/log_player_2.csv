"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $100. Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's offer of $100, but it still costs more than Bob is willing to pay.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob. He can then buy the product from John for $100, which is his maximum price."
