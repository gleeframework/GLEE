"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to buy for under $100.  Starting at $60 gives a good chance of reaching a price within my budget. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will gauge how flexible Alice is on price and help me understand her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $105 is still above my budget and what I'd pay John. I'll counter to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm keeping the increase reasonable.
* **Targeting Below $100:** My counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice while staying below my walk-away price (John's offer).
* **Seeking a Compromise:**  By suggesting we ""meet closer to the middle,"" I'm aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but every dollar counts! While $92.50 is tempting, I'm still aiming to get closer to my $80 target. There's room for Alice to come down a bit more, and I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I can do $85, but that's really as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best offer to signal to Alice that I'm serious and won't budge much more.
* **Slight Increase:**  The small increase from $80 to $85 shows flexibility and keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Below John's Price:**  Importantly, I'm staying below my walk-away price, ensuring I still get a better deal with Alice if she accepts."
