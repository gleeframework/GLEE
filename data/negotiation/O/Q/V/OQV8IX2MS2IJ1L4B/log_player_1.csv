Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. However, I'm open to discussing a price that works best for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's value is $800,000, Alice holds a strong position with John as a backup buyer. Starting with a price closer to her minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing Alice's absolute bottom line. This allows for Bob to potentially counter with a higher offer than $800,000 if he perceives significant value.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the conversation. 

**The goal is to:**

1. **Maximize Profit:** Ideally, secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
2. **Secure a Deal:**  While aiming high, the offer and message leave room for a mutually agreeable outcome, avoiding a swift rejection."
