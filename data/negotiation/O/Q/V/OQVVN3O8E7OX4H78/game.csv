"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. I hope this suggestion aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's value doesn't quite justify the $11000 price point. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $10500. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
