# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Although Alice's offer is tempting, you can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John.  Saving $100,000 makes more sense than taking a chance with further negotiation."
