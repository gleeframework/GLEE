"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

While I'm happy to sell the product for $120, I'm not going to accept Bob's first counteroffer. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can meet in the middle.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $135 in this round. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also show him that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product."

I'm making a final counteroffer of $128. This is a very small step down from my last offer and shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
