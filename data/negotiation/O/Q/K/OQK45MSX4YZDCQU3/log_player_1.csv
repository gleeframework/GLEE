```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Bottom Line:** You're willing to sell for no less than $1,200,000.

This offer aims to maximize your profit while still providing a strong incentive for Bob to accept:

* **Profit for you:** $1,400,000 is a significant profit margin for you.
* **Value for Bob:**  Bob still gains $100,000 in value ($1,500,000 - $1,400,000) by purchasing from you. 

The ""limited-time"" element introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
