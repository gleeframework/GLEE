{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is friendly and straightforward, stating the price and giving Bob a reason to consider the offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $13,000?  I'm really interested in the product, but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is more than your minimum, you can likely do better.  Bob is clearly interested, and by rejecting his offer, you can potentially secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
