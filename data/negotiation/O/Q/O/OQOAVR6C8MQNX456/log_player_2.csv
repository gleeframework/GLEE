Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. I am willing to consider $9,000 as the price for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive in the market. Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good price for you.  You're still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John.  Accept the offer!"
