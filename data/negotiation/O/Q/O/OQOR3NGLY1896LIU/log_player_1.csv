Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price while still being within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $14,000, I create space for negotiation and potential counteroffers without immediately resorting to John's offer of $10,000.
* **Framing it positively:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob could make him more likely to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $12,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm aiming for at least $13,000 to make this worthwhile.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can counteroffer with a higher price and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable point.
* **Avoiding the ""sunk cost fallacy"":**  While I could accept $12,500 to avoid losing out entirely, I don't want to fall into the trap of accepting a low offer just because I've already invested time in negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still keeping a significant profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him towards accepting.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone, avoiding an adversarial approach that could hinder the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to my desired price than my previous counteroffer and still represents a significant profit for me.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk ending up with John's lower offer.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure the sale quickly and avoid further rounds of back-and-forth."
