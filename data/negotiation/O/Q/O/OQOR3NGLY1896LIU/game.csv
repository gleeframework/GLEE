"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to you.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
