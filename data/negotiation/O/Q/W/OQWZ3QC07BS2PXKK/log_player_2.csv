"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than your maximum budget ($10,000).
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save $2,000."
