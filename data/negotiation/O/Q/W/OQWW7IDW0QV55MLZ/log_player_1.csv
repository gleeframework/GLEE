{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an initial offer of $15,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $12000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? I'm suggesting $13000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $14,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and would like to propose $13500 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price point.  At this point, it's a good compromise and I'm willing to accept.  While I could potentially try to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale completely."
