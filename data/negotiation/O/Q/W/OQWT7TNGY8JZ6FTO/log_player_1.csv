Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants a lower price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting because it guarantees a sale, it's only worth $100 to me, which is the same as selling to John. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $105. I would like to propose a final price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $95 is too low for me.  Even though it would mean a quick sale, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  I'm better off selling to John for $100, ensuring I at least break even."
