Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $175. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special price"" and highlighting the product's quality aims to justify the price and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests a willingness to discuss the price further if Bob hesitates.

While you know Bob values the product at $150, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more to avoid missing out. By starting at $175, you give yourself the best chance to maximize your profit."
