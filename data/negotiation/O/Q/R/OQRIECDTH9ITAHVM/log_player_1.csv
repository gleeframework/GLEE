Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but hopefully not so high that Bob immediately rejects it.  I'll be watching for his reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's less than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's appealing to Bob without sacrificing too much of my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is just slightly above my minimum value, but it shows that I'm serious about negotiating. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it.  If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several counteroffers. At this point, it's clear that we aren't going to agree on a price.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling for less than my minimum value."
