Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting Alice closer to her desired price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to consider the deal seriously.
* **Gauge Interest:** By ending with ""What are your thoughts?"", Alice invites Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially reveal how interested he is. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
