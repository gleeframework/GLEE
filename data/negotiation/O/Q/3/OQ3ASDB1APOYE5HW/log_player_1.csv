{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to be aware of John's offer of $12,000, as this is your safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $10,500 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $10,250. This is better than selling to John, but not ideal. It shows the value of negotiating with multiple buyers."
