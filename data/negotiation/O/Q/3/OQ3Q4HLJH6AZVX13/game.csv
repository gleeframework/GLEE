"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This gives you a significant saving and allows me to make a good profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
