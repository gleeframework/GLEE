"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do at the moment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,750 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $15,000.
*  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer again, and he may end up paying John's higher price.
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
