"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to build rapport and highlight the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. 

By offering a high initial price, I can potentially secure a better deal while still leaving space for bargaining. This approach aims to maximize my profit while also allowing for a potential win-win outcome with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I still have 9 rounds left to potentially get a better deal with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting, I show that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **Explore Higher Offers:**  It allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 

This decision balances the risk of not getting a deal with Bob against the potential of a more lucrative outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm confident the product is worth more, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12,500? This would be a great value for you and still allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price in the middle ground between Bob's offer and my initial price. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the product's potential benefits. 
* **Fair Profit:** I explicitly mention wanting a ""fair profit"" to justify my counteroffer and show I'm not just trying to squeeze him.

By offering a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, I aim to increase the chances of closing the deal while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to sell for $9,500. Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I've already shown flexibility, and Bob seems willing to negotiate. I believe there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.
* **Limited Rounds:** I have 6 rounds left. Selling now would leave me with less time to potentially get a better deal.

I will try to counteroffer Bob once again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000, I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000? This would be a great deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with this sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm on Minimum:** I state my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to set a clear boundary.
* **Compromise Offer:**  I'm offering $11,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows I'm trying to meet him in the middle.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that this price is beneficial for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially increasing the chances of a deal.

I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm down to my last four rounds.  

While there's a chance he might budge, the risk of getting stuck with a price below my minimum is too high.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

This decision prioritizes a certain outcome over a potential, but less likely, better deal with Bob."
