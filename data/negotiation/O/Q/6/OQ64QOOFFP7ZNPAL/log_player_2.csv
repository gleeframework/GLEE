"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110. 
* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* A counteroffer of $95 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still a reasonable offer given Bob's maximum price of $120. 
* This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $105, which is a fair price for both parties.
* Bob values the product at $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $105, so there is a $15 margin for both.
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation that could lead to a breakdown in the deal."
