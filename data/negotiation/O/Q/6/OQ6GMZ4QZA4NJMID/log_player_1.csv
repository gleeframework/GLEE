Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high price of $170, you anchor the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Option to Negotiate:** This initial offer doesn't mean you won't come down in price. It simply starts the conversation and leaves space for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** Remember, you always have the option to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it's not progressing favorably and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $100 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer to your target, accepting it would mean losing out on potential profit. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find that this product provides significant value at that price."", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above your absolute minimum ($120). 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can make Bob feel like he's getting a fairer deal while still securing a reasonable price for you.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value can subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.
* **Leaving room to negotiate:**  This counteroffer leaves some space for further negotiation if Bob comes back with another counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached your minimum acceptable price of $120. There's no point in rejecting this offer and potentially losing the sale, especially since you have another buyer lined up at the same price. Accepting this offer secures you your desired profit."
