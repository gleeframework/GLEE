"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
