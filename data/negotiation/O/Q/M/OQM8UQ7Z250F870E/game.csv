"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a great starting point,  I'm hoping we can come to an even better agreement. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
