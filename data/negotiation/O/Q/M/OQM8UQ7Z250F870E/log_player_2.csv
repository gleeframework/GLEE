"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There's still room to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a great starting point,  I'm hoping we can come to an even better agreement. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer at $850,000 saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential of getting a slightly lower price."
