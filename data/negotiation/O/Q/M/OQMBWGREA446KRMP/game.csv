"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than its worth to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  This allows you to secure a valuable asset at a price that's still well below its true value to you.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
