# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount of money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
