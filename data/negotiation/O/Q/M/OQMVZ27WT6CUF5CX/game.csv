"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
