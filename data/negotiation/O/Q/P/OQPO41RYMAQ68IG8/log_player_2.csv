"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You want to save as much money as possible, and $115 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still above your target price of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."
