Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100), hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate. I'll need to gauge his reaction and be prepared to lower my price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price ($100).  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 95}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $95. This is still above my minimum price of $100 and closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as it's still below my minimum price of $100. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation in hopes of getting closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $90, which is still above my minimum. It's a small compromise that might be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."
