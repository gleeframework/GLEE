"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to consider one more offer, but I need to make sure it's a fair deal for both of us. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that it's the best I can do.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
