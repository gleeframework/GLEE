"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $115. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to consider $110? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $112. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",112.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $106?",106.0,Bob,6,
