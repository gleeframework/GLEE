Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point, and I'm hoping to get as close to that as possible. I'm willing to negotiate down if Bob makes a reasonable counteroffer, but I want to see what he's willing to offer first. I'll always have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if I feel like I'm not getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better than selling to John and I can move on to other opportunities."
