"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It's in your best interest to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's allows room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer outright, but it establishes your interest while signaling a willingness to move up towards your budget limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. There's room for further negotiation, and it's strategically advantageous to see how low Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still quite a stretch for me. I could consider going up to $700,000. This offer reflects my budget constraints while acknowledging the product's value."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer moves closer to your maximum budget, but not significantly. It's important to continue negotiating incrementally to see if Alice is willing to settle closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to go up to $700,000. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time, I'll come down to $900,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and the price difference is no longer significant enough to warrant continued negotiation. Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you stay within your budget and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
