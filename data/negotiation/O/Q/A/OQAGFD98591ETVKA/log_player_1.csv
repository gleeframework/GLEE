Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the value it will bring to your operations. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering the product significantly below this to Bob allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** Highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""potential"" for Bob aims to justify the price in his mind, even though it's higher than his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the invitation to ""discuss further"" signal flexibility and openness to negotiation, potentially leading to a price Bob finds acceptable above his $800,000 valuation.

This strategy aims to find a balance:  secure a deal with Bob above his valuation while staying below your guaranteed selling price to John."
