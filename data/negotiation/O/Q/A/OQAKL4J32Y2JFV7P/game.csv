"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $110 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $125. That gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $120. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",110.0,Bob,6,
