Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short, and you have room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need. While I would like to sell the product, I'm not willing to compromise so much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **Is still above your minimum:** You're holding your ground and not accepting Bob's initial low offer. 
* **Leaves room for further negotiations:** You can adjust the price again if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and I don't think there's much more room for him to budge.  I'm going to take John's offer of $12,000, as that guarantees I'll reach my target profit."
