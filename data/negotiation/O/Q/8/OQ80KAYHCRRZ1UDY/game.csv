"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  That's a good price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and meet at $92.50?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price.",92.5,Bob,4,
