"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $100, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Buying from John:**  While John's offer is $120, it's the fallback option.  Bob should try to negotiate with Alice first. 

**Strategy:**  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob starts with a counteroffer that's closer to his target price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** Bob provides a reason for the lower price, suggesting it's fair for both parties.
* **Openness:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $95 is still above Bob's desired price range.
* **Buying from John:**  Bob can still get the product for $120 from John, which is a fallback option.
* **Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get closer to his target price.

**Strategy:**  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and meet at $92.50?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Bob proposes a price that's exactly halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, suggesting a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Confidence:**  Bob expresses confidence that $92.50 is a fair price, which might encourage Alice to accept."
