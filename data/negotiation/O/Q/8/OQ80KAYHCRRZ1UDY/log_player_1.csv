"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  That's a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's counteroffer is still within my minimum value. I'll see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and meet at $92.50?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price of $90.  It's not ideal, but it's a good compromise.  I'll take the deal before it falls apart or I risk selling to John for less."
