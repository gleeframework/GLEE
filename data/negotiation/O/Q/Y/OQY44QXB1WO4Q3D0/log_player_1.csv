Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's something that will bring significant benefits to your business, and I believe the price I'm proposing reflects that.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings to your operation.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while giving you a great deal on this high-value asset."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to $950,000, Bob's offer is still a good deal for me. It's better than selling to John and I'm not sure I can push him any further."
