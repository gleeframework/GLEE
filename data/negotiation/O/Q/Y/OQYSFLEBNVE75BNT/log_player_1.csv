"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows for some room for negotiation, but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While I'd like to get as close to my target of $15,000 as possible, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable value.  I believe this counteroffer is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, though it's getting closer.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, so I'll counteroffer again.  I'm starting to think John might be a better option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm starting to feel the pressure as I'm approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and we're running out of time.  I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement that's fair to me, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  John is a sure thing, and I can secure my minimum value with him."
