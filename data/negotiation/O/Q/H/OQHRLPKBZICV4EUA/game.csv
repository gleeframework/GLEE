"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Based on my understanding of your needs, I believe this product could be worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This represents a substantial savings for you, while still providing me with a strong return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
