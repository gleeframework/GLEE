Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

While Alice is coming closer to your price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $850,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000.  At this point, it's more strategic to take the sure thing and buy from John."
