"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",850000.0,Alice,5,
