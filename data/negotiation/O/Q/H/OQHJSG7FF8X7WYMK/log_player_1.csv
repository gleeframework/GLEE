Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, and I value it at a minimum of $1,000,000.  The $950,000 price point leaves room for Bob to see value and profit if he utilizes the product effectively.
* **Strong Starting Point:** This offer establishes a strong position. If Bob negotiates down, there's still a high chance of exceeding John's offer."
