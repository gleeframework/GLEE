"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is good, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While $7,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I have to consider my own minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her original offer, and still well within Bob's budget.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product for a good price without risking further negotiations or needing to resort to buying from John at a higher price."
