"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,000,000 is a significant investment from your side, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This offer reflects the value it holds and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance you could negotiate further, the risk is that you'll either end up paying more than your budget or waste time negotiating.  At this point, it's best to accept the guaranteed price from John and secure the product within your budget."
