"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the value I believe it holds for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
