"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. You should try negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:**  While aiming low, it's important to maintain a polite and respectful tone to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, your goal is to get the product for as close to $120 as possible (John's price) while staying under your $120 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm flexible and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your limit, but you can still try to negotiate a better price.  You're only $5 away from John's price, so it's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $115?  That's a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:** You're moving closer to your limit, but in smaller increments to signal you're serious while still seeking a better deal.
* **Framing:** By saying ""$115 is a fair deal,"" you're subtly anchoring the negotiation around that price point.
* **John's Price in Mind:**  Remember, John's price is your fallback. You're aiming for the best deal with Alice, but you're not afraid to walk away if it doesn't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm going to offer a final price of $120.  This is my best offer, and I really think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your bottom line! There's no point in rejecting and risking her raising the price again. You've successfully negotiated a price equal to John's offer."
