"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I can justify.  I'm sticking to my offer of $120.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $120, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $135. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",135.0,Alice,5,
