# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170.

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $170. This is significantly higher than Bob's value for the product, so he should reject the offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he can buy the product from John for $120. Alice's counteroffer of $145 is still higher than Bob's target price, so he should reject it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I can justify.  I'm sticking to my offer of $120.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $120, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $135. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $120, he should choose this option to save money."
