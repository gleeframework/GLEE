"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's better than John's price of $1,200,000, Bob has room to negotiate and save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. He can likely negotiate further and get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer gives him the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap even more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us and we can finalize this quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $920,000, which is just a bit above the original price I mentioned. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. He can likely negotiate a bit further. By rejecting the offer, Bob has a chance to make one final counteroffer and potentially secure the product for closer to his desired price of $875,000.  Remember, he's aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation."
