"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but no higher. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to this purchase, and I appreciate your persistence. While $950,000 is a significant increase from your initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, and accept $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
