I'm still determined to get a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can close the deal closer to my target."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The negotiation with Bob seems to be getting nowhere. I've already lowered my offer significantly and I'm not sure I'll be able to get closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
