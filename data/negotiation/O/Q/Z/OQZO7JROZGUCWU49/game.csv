"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the immense value this product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline at $1,300,000. I believe the product's value should not exceed $1,000,000 based on market standards and my financial capacity. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
