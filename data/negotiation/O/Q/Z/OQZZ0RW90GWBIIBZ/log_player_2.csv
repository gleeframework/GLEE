"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant sum, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  My initial offer is $1,750,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within these negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your budget or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay  $1,100,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Expressing Interest:** Clearly stating my interest in the product encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,400,000. This reflects a considerable reduction and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $1,400,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer. I'll counteroffer again to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price that's a significant increase from my previous offer and  lands directly between our last two offers, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Clear Target:**  By aiming for $1,250,000, I'm still striving for a price well below my budget and John's alternative offer.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and appreciative tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $1,250,000 is getting closer to a figure that works for me, but I still need a bit more. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,350,000. This compromise shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can close the deal on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! Alice is down to $1,350,000, but that's still above John's price. I think there's room for her to come down a little more, so I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that suggests fairness and can help reach an agreement quicker.
* **Still Below Budget:**  $1,300,000 keeps me under budget and below John's offer.
* **Positive Language:**  I continue to use positive language (""fair deal"", ""appreciate"") to foster a good negotiating environment."
