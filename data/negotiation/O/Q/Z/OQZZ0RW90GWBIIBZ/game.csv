"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant sum, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  My initial offer is $1,750,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within these negotiations.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay  $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,400,000. This reflects a considerable reduction and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $1,250,000 is getting closer to a figure that works for me, but I still need a bit more. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,350,000. This compromise shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can close the deal on this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
