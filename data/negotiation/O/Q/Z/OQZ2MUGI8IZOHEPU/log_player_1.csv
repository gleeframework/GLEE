"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, starting the negotiation process. 
* **Not Too High:** While I'm starting high, I'm not going for a price close to my minimum ($15,000). This allows me to potentially make concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $15,000. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm confident I can get a better price than $10,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $14,000?  That's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth it. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still maintaining a price significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob would get at this price, emphasizing that it's still a good deal for him.
* **Emphasize Collaboration:** I'm using phrases like ""work together"" to create a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to find a compromise. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation, as $14,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering your valuation of $15,000 and my maximum budget of $10,000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe I can still get a better price than $11,000, especially considering Bob has already shown a willingness to increase his offer. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm confident I can achieve a better outcome by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to continue working with you. However, $11,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing that I'm committed to finding a compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he gets at this price, emphasizing that it's still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using phrases like ""closer to a deal"" to create a sense of progress and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a good compromise considering my budget and your valuation of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful about accepting offers that are too low.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Even though Bob is close to his budget, he has shown a willingness to increase his offer in the past. I believe there's still potential to get a better deal.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up to at least $13,000 in the next round. If he doesn't budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the following round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  How about $12,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I really don't want to lose out on the opportunity to work with you. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's only $500 above Bob's last offer, showing a real commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm hinting at a sense of urgency by saying ""I don't want to lose out.""  This could encourage Bob to accept before the opportunity passes.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the positive outcome for both of us if we agree to this price. 
* **Close to Minimum:**  While $12,500 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it's enough to seal the deal."
