{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. I believe it's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.  It also expresses your willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, you can try to get a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $17,500?  I'm still motivated to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. Can we meet in the middle at $16500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise and closer to your desired price than John's offer.  It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
