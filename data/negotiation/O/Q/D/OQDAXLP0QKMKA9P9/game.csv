"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This gives you a solid price point, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $900,000 is still too far below what this product is truly worth. Let's split the difference: $975,000. This gives you a significant discount, but also allows me to get a reasonable return.  If you're serious about getting this product, I think this is our best chance to come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we settle on $925,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
