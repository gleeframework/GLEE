{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $10,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at the maximum price to allow for a potential counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Be fair:**  The offer is still attractive to Bob, as he can potentially save $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it saves me some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and close to my initial offer. It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly higher price, and I could risk losing the deal altogether."
