{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since the product is worth $100 to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'll try to push for a bit more in the next round."
