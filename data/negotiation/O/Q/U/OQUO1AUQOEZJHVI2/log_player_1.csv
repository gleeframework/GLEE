Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point that's lower than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't. I'll be keeping an eye on John's offer as well, and I'll stop negotiating with Bob if it looks like I can get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counteroffer with $13,000. This is a good compromise that's closer to my minimum price but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. Hopefully, this offer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a better deal by counteroffering one last time. If Bob rejects my final offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering my minimum price and Bob's continued low offers. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be selling to John."
