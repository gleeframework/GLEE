Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $100. Would you be interested in purchasing it at that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little lower than my minimum price but gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get close to my desired price of $120 but I'm also aware that I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose $90 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal of $120, Bob is not budging on his price and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale.  John's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to waste more time on this negotiation."
