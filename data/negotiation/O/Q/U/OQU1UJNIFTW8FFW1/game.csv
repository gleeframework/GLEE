"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for it. I'm proposing $950,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
