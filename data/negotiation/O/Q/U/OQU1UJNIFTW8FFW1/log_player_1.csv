Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. $850,000 is still below my minimum desired amount, and I have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for it. I'm proposing $950,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal. With only 6 rounds left, it's best to secure a sale now."
