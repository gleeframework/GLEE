"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $1,200,000 when you can get the same product from John for $800,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This is your best offer, as it is your maximum price. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this price right away, but it sets a clear starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to your maximum price, it's worth seeing if you can push her down further.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you a chance to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering Alice a price higher than your maximum but still significantly lower than her current offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to your maximum price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting and counter-offering again could potentially secure a lower price, saving you more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise again, offering Alice a price higher than your previous counteroffer but still significantly lower than her current offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a good deal, and it might be the final push needed to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have gone on for a while, and Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly.  At this point, it's more advantageous to simply buy the product from John for $800,000.  You've saved a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting more time and potentially not reaching a mutually agreeable price."
