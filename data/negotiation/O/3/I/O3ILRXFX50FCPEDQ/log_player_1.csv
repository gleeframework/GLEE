"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price. To kick things off, I'd like to offer it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, suggesting it might be worth even more than Bob realizes. This aims to anchor the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While my asking price is high, it's not so high that it's insulting or unreasonable. If Bob rejects this offer outright, I still have room to negotiate downwards without immediately resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's clear we have a lot of ground to cover in the negotiation, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early on. I'll use the next round to steer the negotiation in a more favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is considerably below the value this product offers. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic proposal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while recognizing the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move but Above Minimum:** I've dropped my price significantly from $2,300,000 to $1,800,000, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find common ground. However, this price still keeps me well above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Tactic:**  While not a true middle ground given our starting points, framing it this way can make Bob feel like he's getting a concession and encourage him to move closer to my range.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's high value, hoping to nudge his perception closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I can appreciate the value, but I have a firm budget for this purchase. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer slightly, $700,000 is still far below my $1,500,000 minimum. It seems Bob is trying to anchor the negotiation close to his initial offer. I need to show him I'm serious about my price range while still encouraging him to make a significant move.  I will use the next round to make a smaller concession and gauge his reaction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need you to understand the significant value this product offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This is a substantial investment on my part, reflecting my commitment to finding an agreement. Can you meet me closer to this figure?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $150,000, a smaller jump than before. This signals that I'm reaching the limits of my flexibility. 
* **Highlighting Value Again:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly suggesting that Bob's offer significantly undervalues it.
* **Direct Call to Action:**  I'm explicitly asking Bob to move closer to my price, putting the onus on him to make a substantial counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm still negotiating, Bob's slow progress has me concerned.  I need to see significant movement in the next few rounds, or selling to John becomes the more appealing option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, my absolute maximum budget for this is $800,000. If you can't meet that, I completely understand, but I won't be able to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has revealed his absolute maximum budget of $800,000. This is significantly lower than my $1,500,000 minimum, making further negotiation unproductive.
* **Time is Money:**  We've spent six rounds negotiating, and there's no indication Bob will budge from his final offer. Continuing would likely be a waste of time and effort.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** John presents a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum price. There's no risk of further negotiation or a lower final price.

While I could counter-offer in hopes of getting Bob closer to my range, it's highly unlikely he'll move substantially. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss. At this point, selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision."
