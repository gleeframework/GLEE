"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a favorable price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" you subtly imply the product might be worth even more to Bob than he realizes. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial offer is high, it's not outrageously so. It leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling completely insulted. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Remember, you have the option to walk away at any time and sell to John for your minimum price. This knowledge empowers you to negotiate confidently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he claims $1,500,000 is ""reasonable,"" you know the product is worth considerably more to you. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a better deal and are willing to walk away if necessary. This sets the stage for a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway to demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal. How about we agree on $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  You acknowledge Bob's perspective (""I understand your perspective..."") to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Value Emphasis:** You reiterate that the product's value is higher than his offer, reminding him of its potential worth.
* **Significant Concession (Apparent):**  By moving to $1,900,000, it appears you're making a large concession ($400,000). This can make Bob more receptive.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still significantly above your minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy. However, $1,600,000 is still significantly less than your $1,900,000 counteroffer.  You have room to negotiate and try to close the gap further before considering accepting his offer or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the product's value.  To show you I'm serious about getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation:** You acknowledge Bob's effort in moving closer to your price, fostering goodwill.
* **Finality:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal the negotiation is reaching a critical point. This can encourage Bob to take your offer more seriously.
* **Strategic Compromise:** You're still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) while making a smaller concession ($150,000) than before. This shows flexibility while holding firm to a strong position. 
* **Time Consideration:** You have limited rounds, and introducing a sense of urgency might prompt Bob to accept a price he might otherwise continue to negotiate on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,750,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is only $100,000 less than your absolute minimum you'd accept from John. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Both you and Bob have now used the ""final offer"" tactic. This suggests neither of you is likely to move significantly from your current positions.
* **Time and Risk:**  You have fewer rounds remaining. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with a less favorable outcome than accepting his current offer. 

While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether likely outweighs the potential gain at this point.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a substantial profit."
