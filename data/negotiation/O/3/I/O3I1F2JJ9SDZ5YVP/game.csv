"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low. How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference: $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  I'm confident you'll agree that this price reflects the product's value and will be a great investment for your company. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, which is $980,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, we can finalize the deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
