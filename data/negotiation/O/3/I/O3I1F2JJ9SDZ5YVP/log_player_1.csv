"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for discussion and counteroffers.

**Remember:**  I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to settle for a price lower than $1,000,000. I'll use this to my advantage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I'm aiming for at least $1,000,000, so $900,000 is not acceptable.
* **I have time to negotiate:** It's only round 2, so I have plenty of rounds left to explore a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John. 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low. How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer. 
* **Still above my minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but offering a price that could be tempting for Bob.
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""benefits us both"" to create a collaborative tone and emphasize the win-win potential.
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to his business.

**Next steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I'll continue to counteroffer, aiming to slowly bring the price closer to my minimum while maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **I'm not under pressure:** It's only round 4, and I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't get a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my minimum price while maintaining a positive and collaborative negotiation style. I'll keep reminding Bob of the value the product will bring to his business and try to find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference: $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  I'm confident you'll agree that this price reflects the product's value and will be a great investment for your company. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making this my final offer, aiming to close the deal.
* **Split the difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Stating my bottom line:** I'm clearly communicating that this is my absolute minimum price.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential for his company. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** If he rejects, I will sell to John for $1,000,000. If he accepts, I've successfully closed the deal at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to meet your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, which is $980,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $980,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **My minimum is a safe bet:** I can confidently sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal than what Bob is offering.

**I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure I reach my minimum price goal and secure a good deal within the limited time frame. **"
