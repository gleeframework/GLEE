(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. I'll consider my options:

1. Accept Bob's offer: This would mean selling the product for $1,200,000, which is lower than my initial price. I might be leaving some money on the table, but it's a guaranteed sale.
2. Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round: I could try to negotiate further and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer. However, I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him.
