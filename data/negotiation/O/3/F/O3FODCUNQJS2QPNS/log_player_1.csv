Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between getting a good price and ensuring Bob accepts. 

* **For you:** It's $20 more than your minimum, a significant profit.
* **For Bob:**  It's $20 less than what the product is worth to him, a good deal for him. 

While you could ask for more, the risk of Bob rejecting and you having to sell to John for $80 is real. This offer maximizes your chances of a good sale."
