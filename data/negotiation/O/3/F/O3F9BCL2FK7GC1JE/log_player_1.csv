"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum value. It's a bold opening move that should give Bob a sense of the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $1,000,000, it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation. It shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm not yet ready to settle for that price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that is well above my minimum.  I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept the offer, as we're nearing the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to take a calculated risk.  I'm offering $1,550,000. This is a risky move since it's just $50,000 above my minimum value. However, I believe Bob might be willing to close the deal at this point to avoid further negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. 

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, we're running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than I can get from Bob at this point."
