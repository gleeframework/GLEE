"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you a good profit margin while still giving me a substantial savings compared to buying from John. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
