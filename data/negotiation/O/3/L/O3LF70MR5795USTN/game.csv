"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. How about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
