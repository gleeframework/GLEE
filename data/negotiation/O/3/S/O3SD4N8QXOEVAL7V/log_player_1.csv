"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to give Bob a chance to counter with a more reasonable offer.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While $15,000 is my ideal price, I'm not desperate and can still secure a good deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $10,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:**  I'm again emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and suggesting a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** While I'm willing to go down to $10,000, I still have room to negotiate if necessary."
