"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression that the product's value is significant to you. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, we anchor the negotiation around a high number. While this is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it sets a benchmark for subsequent offers and counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $2,200,000 offer is open for Bob to negotiate. This allows us to gauge his interest and flexibility in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** We always have the option to walk away and sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value of $800,000 than our minimum of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a profit, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. Rejecting his offer signals that we're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is truly worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique value proposition this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a substantial concession from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, this concession keeps us firmly above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" we aim to shift Bob's focus away from his perceived value and towards the potential benefits of the product, justifying a higher price.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We want to keep the negotiation moving forward and prevent a stalemate. This counteroffer shows we are serious about reaching a deal but not at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but within my budget, I am able to offer $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a significant profit above our minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away increases with each round.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner, potentially generating further returns.

Accepting this offer represents a strong balance between maximizing profit and mitigating the risk of losing the deal altogether."
