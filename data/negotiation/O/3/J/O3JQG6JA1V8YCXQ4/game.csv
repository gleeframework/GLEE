"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my own costs. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Bob,6,
