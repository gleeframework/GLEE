"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product.  Considering its potential worth, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This price reflects its unique qualities and the value it can bring to your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is less than what John is offering, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend less.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. Let's compromise at $1,300,000. This leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, and $1,300,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's worth accepting this offer."
