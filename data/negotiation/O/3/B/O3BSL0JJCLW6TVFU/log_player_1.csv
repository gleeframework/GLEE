Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $12,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away. I also only have 4 rounds left, so I need to secure a deal soon."
