"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still too high for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's below Bob's initial limit of $1,500,000 and is a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might refuse further offers and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
