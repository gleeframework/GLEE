"I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While $9,500 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
