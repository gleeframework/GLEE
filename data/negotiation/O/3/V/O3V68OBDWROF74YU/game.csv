"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
