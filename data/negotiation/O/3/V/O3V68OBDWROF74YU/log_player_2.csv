"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to a price that benefits me. I can always buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation goes poorly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but it's still not a good deal for me. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't come closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at a price that's still not a good deal. It seems unlikely she'll go much lower, and I'm not willing to risk it. I can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so that's the best option now."
