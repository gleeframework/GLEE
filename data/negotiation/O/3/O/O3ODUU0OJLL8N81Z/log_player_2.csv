"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still significantly higher than my desired price. I want to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down some, given the product's value is $1,500,000 to her."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than her initial offer, but it's still higher than my desired price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not all the way to her offer. I'm going to counteroffer again in the hopes of finding a middle ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While I'd prefer to get it for even less, at this point, $1,080,000 is a good deal for me. It's much better than paying John $1,500,000, and it's a reasonable compromise with Alice.  I'm going to accept her offer."
