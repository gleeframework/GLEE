# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the immense value it brings. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to invest at a slightly lower price point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to invest at a lower price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  We have several rounds left and can push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $928,000. I'm willing to meet you at $935,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. Let's see if we can push the needle a bit further.

We're close, but $935,000 is still a bit high.  We have a few rounds left and can push for a lower price before we need to consider buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, but we're getting close to a point where we're both going to walk away without a deal.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $931,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 931000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $931,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $936,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $936,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $936,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We are very close, but we have only one round left.  It's risky to keep negotiating as we might not get a better offer from Alice.   The price from John isn't ideal, but it's a guaranteed deal. It's better than potentially losing the deal and having to find another seller."
