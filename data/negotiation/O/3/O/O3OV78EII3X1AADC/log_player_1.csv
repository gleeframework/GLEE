Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) allows me to start negotiations significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the deal.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" justifies the high price and appeals to Bob's potential profit.
* **Alternative buyer:**  While John ensures I won't go below $800,000, prioritizing Bob allows for maximizing profit."
