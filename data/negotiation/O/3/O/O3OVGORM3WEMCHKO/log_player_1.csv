Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $12,000 is below the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher offer might scare Bob off, making him less likely to engage in negotiations. 

By starting with this offer, you are setting the stage for a successful negotiation while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $12,000.  You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount.  This will show Bob you're serious about maximizing your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. It shows flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you're still making a profit.
* **Maintaining pressure:** This counteroffer is not too low, which keeps the pressure on Bob to come up with a higher offer. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price that benefits you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my last counteroffer of $10,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $12,000,  it's likely we've reached a point where further negotiation would be unproductive.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit significantly higher than selling to John for $8,000.  It's important to remember that the goal is to maximize profit, and sometimes settling for a slightly lower price is the best strategy."
