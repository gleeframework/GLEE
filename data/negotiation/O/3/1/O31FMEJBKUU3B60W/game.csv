"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,100,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
