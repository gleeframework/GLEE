"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find the product is worth every penny.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $10,900? This is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
