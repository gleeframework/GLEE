"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $75 right now.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $78?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $81.25. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",81.25,Alice,5,
