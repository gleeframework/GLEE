Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still within a reasonable range considering the value to me.  This will hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
