Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a strategic offer:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is still more than $8,000, but leaves some room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your fallback price:** $14,000 is lower than $15,000, meaning you're still getting a good deal if Bob rejects.

This gives you the best chance of getting a sale with Bob while minimizing your potential loss."
