"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and Alice is offering it at the same price, you're essentially getting no discount.  Rejecting her offer means you can buy it from John for the same price. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer."
