Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, we want to see if we can get more from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($140) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still space to negotiate slightly lower, but never going below our minimum of $150."
