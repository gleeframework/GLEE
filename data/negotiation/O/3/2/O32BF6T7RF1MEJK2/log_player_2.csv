Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go below $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. How about we meet at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $115 and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John for $120 ensures you get the product without potentially overpaying."
