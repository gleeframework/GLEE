"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but that price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $10500 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I can go.  To make this work for me, I need to stay at $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $10000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
