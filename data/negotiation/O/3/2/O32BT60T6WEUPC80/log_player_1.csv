Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob.

**Strategy:** 

* **Start high:** By starting at $12,000, I aim to maximize my profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, creating a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Keep John in mind:**  I'll use John's offer of $15,000 as a benchmark. If Bob doesn't counter with a price I find acceptable, I'll happily sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* While I would ideally sell to John for $15,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:**  I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Emphasize value and compromise:** I reiterate the product's value and position my offer as a compromise to find common ground.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'm open to further negotiation if Bob counters again.  I'm prepared to potentially accept $11,000, but I'm not willing to go lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll do my best to stay within my budget. How about we aim for $10,500? It's a bit higher than my initial offer but still lower than your current proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  $10,500 is closer, but it's still not enough for me. 
* **I'm not willing to risk losing out on a better deal with John:**  I'm confident John will buy the product for $15,000, so I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price with Bob. 
* **I'll counteroffer again:** I will try to negotiate with Bob one more time before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price that's closer to both of our positions.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,250, which is the average of my last offer ($11,000) and his offer ($10,500).
* **Emphasis on fairness and compromise:** I highlight that this price is a fair compromise and is closer to both of our positions.
* **Final attempt before John:**  This is my final counteroffer before I'm ready to sell to John if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $11,000 as a compromise between our positions. This would allow me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now above my minimum:**  $11,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,500. 
* **Risk of losing John:** I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, I might risk losing John, who is willing to pay $15,000.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $11,000 is a reasonable compromise that allows me to make a profit while still satisfying Bob's budget."
