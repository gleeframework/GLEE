"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, however, I know the real value of this product and $8,500 is just too low.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating, aiming to get the price closer to his $8,000 limit."
