You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You're still under your $15,000 limit, and you can likely get it for less."

Alice's offer:

You're very close to your goal of saving as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer at $11,250 is a good deal. It's within your budget and still significantly lower than what John is selling for.  You've successfully negotiated a lower price!"
