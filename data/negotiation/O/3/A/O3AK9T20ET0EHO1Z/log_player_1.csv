Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're getting more than your $1,200,000 minimum, which is important.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  At $1,400,000, Bob still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you can still make a profit and potentially even reach a higher price.

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with that price. Considering the value of the product to me and your own valuation, I'd be willing to pay $1250000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to your initial offer. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to potentially increase the price further.  Here's why:

* **You have leverage:**  Bob clearly sees value in the product, and you've shown you're willing to negotiate.
* **Time is on your side:**  You have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a safety net.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  A counteroffer from you could push Bob closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you're keeping the negotiation active and increasing your chances of securing a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal.  It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing flexibility by coming down from your previous offer.
* **Fair price:** You're still getting a good deal, above your minimum, and it's significantly closer to what Bob is offering. 
* **Motivating language:** You're emphasizing the value Bob will receive from the product.
* **Middle ground:**  You're proposing a middle ground, which can be persuasive in negotiations. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, while still giving you a significant profit."
