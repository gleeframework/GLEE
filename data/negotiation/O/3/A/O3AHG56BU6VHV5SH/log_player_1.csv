"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, especially considering I know the product is worth $120 to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to the middle ground. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a little lower than I'd like, it's getting closer to my ideal price and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale at a reasonable price than risk losing the deal altogether."
