{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's always beneficial to aim higher initially. Bob's valuation of $1,000,000 gives us room to negotiate.
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing our bottom line.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and value the offer more.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiating tactics, Alice might adjust the price slightly downwards. However, going below $1,500,000  is not necessary as John provides a guaranteed sale at that price."
