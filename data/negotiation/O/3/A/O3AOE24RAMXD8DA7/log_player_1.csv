Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value:**  I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Adding a personal touch:** I'm including a friendly message to create a more personal connection and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price of $100, allowing for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could accept it and avoid further negotiation, I'm aiming for a better price.  

I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit lower than I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but hold firm:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I keep the message friendly to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Clear counteroffer:** I explicitly state my new price of $95."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $90?  I'm really interested in the product, and this is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is just $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, suggesting further negotiation might be unproductive. 
* **Time and effort:**  Negotiating further might take more time and effort, and I might not be able to get a significantly better price.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable choice considering the factors above."
