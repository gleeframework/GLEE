"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is less than the price from John, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate since the product is worth $80 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $110, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay and leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This should encourage her to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is a price I'm comfortable with.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my offer again, and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees I get the product at a good price."
