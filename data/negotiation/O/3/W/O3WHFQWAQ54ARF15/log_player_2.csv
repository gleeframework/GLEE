Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to meet you at $105, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $110. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us!

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $110, and she's made it clear that's her final offer.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John."
