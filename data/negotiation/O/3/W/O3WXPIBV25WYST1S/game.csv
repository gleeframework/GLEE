,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $95.  Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer it to you for $102.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",102.5,Alice,5,
