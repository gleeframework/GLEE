Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,199,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,199,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's very close to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,225,000. This is a reasonable compromise that is still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  Since I can sell to John for the same amount, there's no point in continuing to negotiate."
