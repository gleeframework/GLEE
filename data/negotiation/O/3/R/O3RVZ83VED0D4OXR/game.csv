,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential of the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000. This reflects my maximum budget for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1150000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1250000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth and your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
