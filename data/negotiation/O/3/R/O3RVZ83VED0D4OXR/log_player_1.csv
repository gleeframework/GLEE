"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for me.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm framing the offer as fair, emphasizing the product's value and potential. This is intended to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Flexibility:** The message leaves the door open for discussion and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential of the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value but shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reasoning:** I emphasize the compromise while reiterating the product's value. This aims to make my offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Openness:** I reiterate my desire to reach an agreement, keeping the negotiation open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000. This reflects my maximum budget for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I have more rounds available.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try to push for a higher price and potentially secure a deal closer to my target.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be a safe option, but I'm motivated to try and get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,150,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth and your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $1,250,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Reasoning:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the product's value and my willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** I frame this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider accepting.
* **Strategic Move:**  By stating that I need to consider other options if this offer isn't accepted, I subtly remind Bob of the alternative (selling to John) while leaving the door open for him to agree to a deal closer to my desired outcome."
