Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. $15,000 is a good starting point, but feel free to adjust based on your product and your understanding of the market.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate, showing flexibility and increasing the chance of reaching a deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm not just stating the price; I'm hinting at the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to think about its worth to him. 

This is a good starting point.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Test the Waters:**  See if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to go higher. 
* **Gain Leverage:**  Show that I'm not desperate to sell and have other options (like John).
* **Potentially Secure a Higher Price:** By making a counteroffer, I might be able to get closer to my initial asking price. 

I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a significant value considering the product's unique features. This price also allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but I'm also making it clear that I'm willing to compromise. This builds trust and shows that I'm actively trying to find a solution.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique features, reminding Bob of its potential value to him.
* **Fair Split:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm being fair. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum price, and I'm satisfied with this outcome.  Here's why:

* **Close to Minimum:** I'm only $1,000 below my minimum, which is a small difference considering the potential value of the product.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing negotiations could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate or even a lower price.
* **Risk of John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $10,000, which is essentially the same as what Bob is offering.

It's important to be pragmatic and recognize when a good deal is on the table, even if it's not the absolute highest price. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
