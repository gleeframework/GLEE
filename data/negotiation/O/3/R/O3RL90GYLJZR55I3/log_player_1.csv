Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Knowing how valuable it would be for you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  It's a win-win!"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, while still ensuring a good profit beyond our minimum ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down a little, while still potentially landing within a very profitable range for us.
* **Confident but Friendly Tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value and appeal to Bob's side of the deal, fostering a positive negotiation environment. 

By starting at $925,000, we give ourselves the best chance to secure a final price significantly higher than John's offer."
