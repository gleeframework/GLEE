{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price reflects the true worth and potential this product holds.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This seems to be a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might push him away. Accepting $850,000 is a good deal and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
