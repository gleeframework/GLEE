Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:**  I'm willing to sell to John for $8,000, so that's my floor.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Split the difference:** Offering $10,000 splits the difference between my minimum and Bob's value. This is a fair price that maximizes my earnings while still leaving Bob with a good deal. 

This offer increases my chances of getting a better price than selling to John while also being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
