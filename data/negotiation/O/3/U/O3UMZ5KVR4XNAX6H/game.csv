"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to start the conversation.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to reach your target price, but $875,000 is still slightly above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $862,500 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $862,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm going to add a small premium to account for the value I bring to the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.",880000.0,Alice,5,
