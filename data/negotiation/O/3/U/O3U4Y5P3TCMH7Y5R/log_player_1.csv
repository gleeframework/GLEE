Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter offer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start your negotiation with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has a chance to influence the final price and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important:**  While Bob only values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay more if he perceives its value to be higher or has a pressing need for it.  This strategy aims to explore that possibility."
