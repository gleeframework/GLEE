"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product, nor does it offer me a fair profit. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the value it brings to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range, I am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 still falls short of my expectations. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product at $875,000.  This is a reasonable price that reflects both the value you'll gain and my need for a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further back and forth.",875000.0,Alice,5,
