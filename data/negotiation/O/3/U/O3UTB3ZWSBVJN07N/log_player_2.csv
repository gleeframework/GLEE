"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to your desired price range, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. If that fails, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, bringing the price closer to your maximum budget.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is still higher than my maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at a guaranteed $800,000. Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of either reaching an unacceptable price or losing the product entirely."
