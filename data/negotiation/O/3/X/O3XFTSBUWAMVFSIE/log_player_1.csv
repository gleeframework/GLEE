Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is high enough to be attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. However, it also leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it is still significantly lower than my ideal price. I will reject his offer and counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. It reflects my desire to earn a higher price than John's offer while remaining open to further discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I will reject his offer and counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price. I believe we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's only $50,000 less than Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his last offer is too low for me to consider. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,250,000 and it seems he's not willing to go higher than $1,100,000.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale and a decent profit, so that's the best option at this point."
