Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to get a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm making a final concession, dropping my price to $135.  This is very close to my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'm going to sell to John."
