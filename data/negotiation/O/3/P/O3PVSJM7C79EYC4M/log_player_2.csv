Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the potential this product holds for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, I still believe the product's intrinsic value is higher. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price. To meet you halfway, I propose a final offer of $1,175,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the value this product will bring to your business.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, she's still significantly above my $1,000,000 limit. At this point, it's unlikely she'll drop to a price I'm willing to pay within the remaining rounds.  It makes more financial sense to cut my losses and purchase from John at my target price."
