Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $175 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me room to negotiate down if Bob rejects.
* **Positive tone:** A positive message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below Bob's perceived value of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Potential to earn more:** Selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, but I believe I can get a higher price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $120 is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:**  The message emphasizes that the offer is still a good deal for Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Continuing a positive tone encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe there is still potential to reach a price that is both acceptable to me and to Bob. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit, but I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** $110 is a further compromise that demonstrates my willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" and ""happiness"" aspect of the offer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm leaving less room for further negotiation, which could incentivize Bob to accept."
