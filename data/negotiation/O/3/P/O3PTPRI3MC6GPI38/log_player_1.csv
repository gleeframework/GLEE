{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or, if he seems unwilling to negotiate, I can walk away and sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer. I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I initially offered.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $900,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my initial asking price and is only $25,000 less than my previous counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, it's still a good deal and a lot more than I'd get from John. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and finalizes the deal."
