{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's a bit below my minimum price point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm getting closer to John's price, so I'm still in a good position to negotiate."

# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I respect that.  However, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal.  If you decline, I'll have to explore other options.
