"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise at $105, which is still a good discount from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming closer to my budget, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $105. I can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially missing out on the guaranteed deal."
