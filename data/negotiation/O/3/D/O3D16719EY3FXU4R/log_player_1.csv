While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $880,000 is a strategic move. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's a substantial profit over my minimum ($800,000) and John's standing offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties if negotiations continue.  
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to compromise for a mutually beneficial deal. 

It's always tempting to try for more, but sometimes a good deal in hand is better than the possibility of a slightly better deal in the future."
