"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",12000.0,Alice,3,
