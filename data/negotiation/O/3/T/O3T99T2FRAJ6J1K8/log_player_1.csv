Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to come in lower.  How about $970,000? This represents a good compromise for both of us.  I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is steadily increasing his offer. While $970,000 is a tempting offer, holding out a bit longer might yield a better deal. We can afford to be a bit more patient and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $978,000. I believe this is a very competitive offer and reflects the significant value this product brings. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 978000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are getting closer to a potential agreement. Lowering the price slightly demonstrates flexibility but maintains a firm stance on the product's value. This offer encourages Bob to counter with a price closer to our desired range."
