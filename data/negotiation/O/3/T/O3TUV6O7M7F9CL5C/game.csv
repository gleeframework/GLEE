"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective, this product holds significant value, and $600,000 is considerably below its worth.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $900,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and potential for return.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to considering a price of $700,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's worth and my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I have to be realistic about the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price reflects its potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, I'm on a tight budget and $850,000 is pushing it.  My best offer is $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while working within my financial constraints.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be upfront â€“ I can't accept anything less than $800,000 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value it brings. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
