"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise and would still be a great deal for you. Let's reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can find a deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000 as a final compromise. This still represents a fantastic value for you and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've both been willing to compromise, so let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept your final offer of $925,000. It's not my ideal price, but I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal for both of us. Let's close this and move forward.",925000.0,Alice,9,
