"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation without risking going too low too quickly. It's also a strong signal that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, while still leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm not ready to settle yet, especially since I have more rounds to work with.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

$950,000 is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually acceptable price. I'm still in a good position with 6 rounds remaining."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise and would still be a great deal for you. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can find a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000 as a final compromise. This still represents a fantastic value for you and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.
