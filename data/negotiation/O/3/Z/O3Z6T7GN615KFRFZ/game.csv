"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a strong starting point. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This still represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $25,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
