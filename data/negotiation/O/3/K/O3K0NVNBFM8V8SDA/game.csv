"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To make this work for both of us, I'm proposing $1,100,000. This allows me to achieve a fairer return on the product's potential.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's reach a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
