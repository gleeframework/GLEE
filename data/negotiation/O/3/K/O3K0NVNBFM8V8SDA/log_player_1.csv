"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To make this work for both of us, I'm proposing $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer in the next round."
