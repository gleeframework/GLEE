Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price higher than both Bob's value and your minimum ($100) aims to establish a high anchor point. This might make Bob perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it allows space for potential counter-offers from Bob, moving towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a price lower than your minimum. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
