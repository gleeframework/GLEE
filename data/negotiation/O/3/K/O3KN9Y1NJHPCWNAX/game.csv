"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $900000. My minimum price is $1100000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000. Can you consider $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above the midpoint. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I can offer it to you for $1050000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay $975000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $1025000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
