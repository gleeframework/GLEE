You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it leaves room for bargaining and hopefully reaching a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? That would still be a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is coming closer to my price range, but I'm still willing to see if I can negotiate a slightly better deal before going with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we settle on $80? That's a good compromise and still gives you a great deal on the product.

Alice has met my maximum price, and it's the same as what John is offering. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John since the price will be the same."
